<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>The idea of publishing the work here presented did not suggest itself
until a large portion of the material it contains had been accumulated
for the private use and personal gratification of the author. In
pursuing the study of the Bible Myths, facts pertaining thereto, in a
condensed form, seemed to be greatly needed, and nowhere to be found.
Widely scattered through hundreds of ancient and modern volumes, most of
the contents of this book may indeed be found; but any previous attempt
to trace exclusively the myths and legends of the Old and New Testament
to their origin, published as a separate work, is not known to the
writer of this. Many able writers have shown our so-called Sacred
Scriptures to be unhistorical, and have pronounced them largely
legendary, but have there left the matter, evidently aware of the great
extent of the subject lying beyond. As Thomas Scott remarks, in his
<i>English Life of Jesus</i>: "<i>How</i> these narratives (<i>i. e.</i>, the New
Testament narratives), unhistorical as they have been shown to be, came
into existence, <i>it is not our business to explain</i>; and once again, at
the end of the task, as at the beginning and throughout, we must
emphatically disclaim the obligation." To pursue the subject from the
point at which it is abandoned by this and many other distinguished
writers, has been the labor of the author of this volume for a number of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>years. The result of this labor is herewith submitted to the reader,
but not without a painful consciousness of its many imperfections.</p>

<p>The work naturally begins with the Eden myth, and is followed by a
consideration of the principal Old Testament legends, showing their
universality, origin and meaning. Next will be found the account of the
birth of Christ Jesus, with his history until the close of his life upon
earth, showing, in connection therewith, the universality of the myth of
the Virgin-born, Crucified and Resurrected Saviour.</p>

<p>Before showing the <i>origin</i> and <i>meaning</i> of the myth (which is done in
<a href="#CHAPTER_XXXIX">Chapter XXXIX.</a>), we have considered the <i>Miracles of Christ Jesus</i>, the
<i>Eucharist</i>, <i>Baptism</i>, the <i>Worship of the Virgin</i>, <i>Christian
Symbols</i>, the <i>Birthday of Christ Jesus</i>, the <i>Doctrine of the Trinity</i>,
<i>Why Christianity Prospered</i>, and the <i>Antiquity of Pagan Religions</i>,
besides making a comparison of the legendary histories of <i>Crishna and
Jesus</i>, and <i>Buddha and Jesus</i>. The concluding chapter relates to the
question, What do we really know about Jesus?</p>

<p>In the words of Prof. Max M&uuml;ller (<i>The Science of Religion</i>, p. 11): "A
comparison of all the religions of the world, in which none can claim a
privileged position, will no doubt seem to many dangerous and
reprehensible, because ignoring that peculiar reverence which everybody,
down to the mere fetish worshiper, feels for his own religion, and for
his own god. Let me say, then, at once, that I myself have shared these
misgivings, but that I have tried to overcome them, because I would not
and could not allow myself to surrender either what I hold to be the
truth, or what I hold still dearer than truth, the right of testing
truth. Nor do I regret it. I do not say that the <i>Science of Religion</i>
is all gain. No, it entails losses, and losses of many things which we
hold dear. But this I will say, that, as far as my humble judgment goes,
it does not entail the loss of anything that is essential to <i>true
religion</i>, and that, if we strike the balance honestly, <i>the gain is
immeasurably greater than the loss</i>."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span></p><p>"All truth is safe, and nothing else is safe; and he who keeps back the
truth, or withholds it from men, from motives of expediency, is either a
coward or a criminal, or both."</p>

<p>But little beyond the arrangement of this work is claimed as original.
Ideas, phrases, and even whole paragraphs have been taken from the
writings of others, and in most, if not in all cases, acknowledged; but
with the thought in mind of the many hours of research this book may
save the student in this particular line of study; with the
consciousness of having done for others that which I would have been
thankful to have found done for myself; and more than all, with the hope
that it may in some way help to hasten the day when the mist of
superstition shall be dispelled by the light of reason; with all its
defects, it is most cheerfully committed to its fate by the author.</p>

<h1>BIBLE MYTHS.</h1>

<h2>PART I.</h2>

<h3>THE OLD TESTAMENT.</h3>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE CREATION AND FALL OF MAN.</h3>

<p>The Old Testament commences with one of its most interesting myths, that
of the Creation and Fall of Man. The story is to be found in the first
<i>three</i> chapters of Genesis, the substance of which is as follows:</p>

<p>After God created the "Heavens" and the "Earth," he said: "Let there be
light, and there was light," and after calling the light Day, and the
darkness Night, the <i>first</i> day's work was ended.</p>

<p>God then made the "Firmament," which completed the <i>second</i> day's work.</p>

<p>Then God caused the dry land to appear, which he called "Earth," and the
waters he called "Seas." After this the earth was made to bring forth
grass, trees, &amp;c., which completed the <i>third</i> day's work.</p>

<p>The next things God created were the "Sun,"<a name="FNanchor_1:1_1" id="FNanchor_1:1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1:1_1" class="fnanchor">[1:1]</a> "Moon" and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>"Stars,"
and after he had <i>set them in the Firmament</i>, the <i>fourth</i> day's work
was ended.<a name="FNanchor_2:1_2" id="FNanchor_2:1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2:1_2" class="fnanchor">[2:1]</a></p>

<p>After these, God created great "whales," and other creatures which
inhabit the water, also "winged fowls." This brought the <i>fifth</i> day to
a close.</p>

<p>The work of creation was finally completed on the <i>sixth</i> day,<a name="FNanchor_2:2_3" id="FNanchor_2:2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2:2_3" class="fnanchor">[2:2]</a> when
God made "beasts" of every kind, "cattle," "creeping things," and lastly
"man," whom he created "male and female," in his own image.<a name="FNanchor_2:3_4" id="FNanchor_2:3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_2:3_4" class="fnanchor">[2:3]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the
host of them. And on the <i>seventh</i><a name="FNanchor_2:4_5" id="FNanchor_2:4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_2:4_5" class="fnanchor">[2:4]</a> day God ended his work
which he had made: and he <i>rested</i> on the seventh day, from
all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh
day, and sanctified it, because that in it he had <i>rested</i>
from all his work which God created and made."</p></div>

<p>After this information, which concludes at the <i>third</i> verse of Genesis
ii., strange though it may appear, <i>another</i> account of the Creation
commences, which is altogether different from the one we have just
related. This account commences thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when
they were created, in the day (not days) that the Lord God
made the earth and the heavens."</p></div>

<p>It then goes on to say that "the Lord God formed man of the dust of the
ground,"<a name="FNanchor_2:5_6" id="FNanchor_2:5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_2:5_6" class="fnanchor">[2:5]</a> which appears to be the <i>first</i> thing he made. After
planting a garden eastward in Eden,<a name="FNanchor_2:6_7" id="FNanchor_2:6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_2:6_7" class="fnanchor">[2:6]</a> the Lord God put the man
therein, "and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree
that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the <i>Tree of
Life</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2:7_8" id="FNanchor_2:7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_2:7_8" class="fnanchor">[2:7]</a> also in the midst of the garden, and the <i>Tree of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>Knowledge</i> of good and evil. And a <i>river</i> went out of Eden to water
the garden, and from thence it was parted, and became into <i>four</i>
heads." These <i>four rivers</i> were called, first Pison, second Gihon,
third Hiddekel, and the fourth Euphrates.<a name="FNanchor_3:1_9" id="FNanchor_3:1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_3:1_9" class="fnanchor">[3:1]</a></p>

<p>After the "Lord God" had made the "Tree of Life," and the "Tree of
Knowledge," he said unto the man:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat, but of
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat
of it, <i>for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
surely die</i>." Then the Lord God, thinking that it would not be
well for man to live alone, formed&mdash;out of the ground&mdash;"every
beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought
them unto Adam to see what he would call them, and whatever
Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof."</p></div>

<p>After Adam had given names to "all cattle, and to the fowls of the air,
and to every beast of the field," "the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
fall upon Adam, and he slept, and he (the Lord God) took one of his
(Adam's) ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof.<ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And of the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made
he a <i>woman</i>, and brought her unto Adam." "And they were both
naked, the man and his wife, and they were not ashamed."</p></div>

<p>After this everything is supposed to have gone harmoniously, until a
<i>serpent</i> appeared before the <i>woman</i><a name="FNanchor_3:2_10" id="FNanchor_3:2_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_3:2_10" class="fnanchor">[3:2]</a>&mdash;who was afterwards called
Eve&mdash;and said to her:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?"</p></div>

<p>The woman, answering the serpent, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: but of
the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God
hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, <i>lest ye die</i>."</p></div>

<p>Whereupon the serpent said to her:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"Ye shall <i>not</i> surely die" (which, according to the
narrative, was the truth).</p></div>

<p>He then told her that, upon eating the fruit, their eyes would be
opened, and that they would be as <i>gods</i>, knowing good from evil.</p>

<p>The woman then looked upon the tree, and as the fruit was tempting, "she
took of the fruit, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband, and he
did eat." The result was <i>not</i> death (as the Lord God had told them),
but, as the serpent had said, "the eyes of both were opened, and they
knew they were naked, and they <i>sewed</i> fig leaves together, and made
themselves aprons."</p>

<p>Towards evening (<i>i. e.</i>, "in the cool of the day"), Adam and his wife
"<i>heard</i> the voice of the Lord God <i>walking</i> in the garden," and being
afraid, they hid themselves among the trees of the garden. The Lord God
not finding Adam and his wife, said: "Where art thou?" Adam answering,
said: "I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was
naked, and I hid myself."</p>

<p>The "Lord God" then told Adam that he had eaten of the tree which he had
commanded him not to eat, whereupon Adam said: "The <i>woman</i> whom thou
gavest to be with me, <i>she</i> gave me of the tree and I did eat."</p>

<p>When the "Lord God" spoke to the woman concerning her transgression, she
blamed the <i>serpent</i>, which she said "beguiled" her. This sealed the
serpent's fate, for the "Lord God" cursed him and said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and <i>dust</i> shalt thou eat all
the days of thy life."<a name="FNanchor_4:1_11" id="FNanchor_4:1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_4:1_11" class="fnanchor">[4:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Unto the woman the "Lord God" said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I will greatly multiply thy sorrow, and thy conception; in
sorrow thou shalt bring forth children, and thy desire shall
be to thy husband, <i>and he shall rule over thee</i>."</p></div>

<p>Unto Adam he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and
hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying,
Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;
in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.
Thorns also, and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and
thou shalt eat the herb of the field. In the sweat of thy face
shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground, <i>for
out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust
shalt thou return</i>."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p><p>The "Lord God" then made coats of skin for Adam and his wife, with
which he clothed them, after which he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Behold, the man is become <i>as one of us</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5:1_12" id="FNanchor_5:1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_5:1_12" class="fnanchor">[5:1]</a> to know good
and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also
of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever" (he must be
sent forth from Eden).</p>

<p>"So he (the Lord God) drove out the man (and the woman); and
he placed at the east of the garden of Eden, Cherubims, and a
flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the
Tree of Life."</p></div>

<p>Thus ends the narrative.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to show from whence this legend, or legends, had their
origin, we will notice a feature which is very prominent in the
narrative, and which cannot escape the eye of an observing reader, <i>i.
e.</i>, <i>the two different and contradictory accounts of the creation</i>.</p>

<p>The first of these commences at the first verse of chapter first, and
ends at the third verse of chapter second. The second account commences
at the fourth verse of chapter second, and continues to the end of the
chapter.</p>

<p>In speaking of these contradictory accounts of the Creation, Dean
Stanley says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is now clear to diligent students of the Bible, that the
first and second chapters of Genesis contain two narratives of
the Creation, side by side, differing from each other in most
every particular of time and place and order."<a name="FNanchor_5:2_13" id="FNanchor_5:2_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_5:2_13" class="fnanchor">[5:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Bishop Colenso, in his very learned work on the Pentateuch, speaking on
this subject, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The following are the most noticeable points of difference
between the two cosmogonies:</p>

<p>"1. In the first, the earth emerges from the waters and is,
therefore, <i>saturated with moisture</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5:3_14" id="FNanchor_5:3_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_5:3_14" class="fnanchor">[5:3]</a> In the second, the
'whole face of the ground' <i>requires to be moistened</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5:4_15" id="FNanchor_5:4_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_5:4_15" class="fnanchor">[5:4]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>"2. In the first, the birds and the beasts are created
<i>before man</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6:1_16" id="FNanchor_6:1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:1_16" class="fnanchor">[6:1]</a> In the second, man is created <i>before the
birds and the beasts</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6:2_17" id="FNanchor_6:2_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:2_17" class="fnanchor">[6:2]</a></p>

<p>"3. In the first, 'all fowls that fly' are made out of the
<i>waters</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6:3_18" id="FNanchor_6:3_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:3_18" class="fnanchor">[6:3]</a> In the second 'the fowls of the air' are made
out of the <i>ground</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6:4_19" id="FNanchor_6:4_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:4_19" class="fnanchor">[6:4]</a></p>

<p>"4. In the first, man is created in the image of God.<a name="FNanchor_6:5_20" id="FNanchor_6:5_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:5_20" class="fnanchor">[6:5]</a> In
the second, man is made of the dust of the ground, and merely
animated with the breath of life; and it is only after his
eating the forbidden fruit that 'the Lord God said, Behold,
the man has become <i>as one of us</i>, to know good and
evil.'<a name="FNanchor_6:6_21" id="FNanchor_6:6_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:6_21" class="fnanchor">[6:6]</a></p>

<p>"5. In the first, man is made lord of the <i>whole earth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6:7_22" id="FNanchor_6:7_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:7_22" class="fnanchor">[6:7]</a>
In the second, he is merely placed in the garden of Eden, 'to
dress it and to keep it.'<a name="FNanchor_6:8_23" id="FNanchor_6:8_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:8_23" class="fnanchor">[6:8]</a></p>

<p>"6. In the first, the man and the woman are <i>created
together</i>, as the closing and completing work of the whole
creation,&mdash;created also, as is evidently implied, in the same
kind of way, to be the complement of one another, and, thus
created, they are blessed <i>together</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6:9_24" id="FNanchor_6:9_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:9_24" class="fnanchor">[6:9]</a></p>

<p>"In the second, the beasts and birds are created <i>between</i> the
man and the woman. First, the man is made of the dust of the
ground; he is placed by <i>himself</i> in the garden, charged with
a solemn command, and threatened with a curse if he breaks it;
<i>then the beasts and birds are made</i>, and the man gives names
to them, and, lastly, after all this, <i>the woman is made out
of one of his ribs</i>, but merely as a helpmate for the
man.<a name="FNanchor_6:10_25" id="FNanchor_6:10_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:10_25" class="fnanchor">[6:10]</a></p>

<p>"The fact is, that the <i>second</i> account of the Creation,<a name="FNanchor_6:11_26" id="FNanchor_6:11_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:11_26" class="fnanchor">[6:11]</a>
together with the story of the Fall,<a name="FNanchor_6:12_27" id="FNanchor_6:12_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:12_27" class="fnanchor">[6:12]</a> is manifestly
composed by a <i>different writer</i> altogether from him who wrote
<i>the first</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6:13_28" id="FNanchor_6:13_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:13_28" class="fnanchor">[6:13]</a></p>

<p>"This is suggested at once by the circumstance that,
throughout the <i>first</i> narrative, the Creator is always spoken
of by the name Elohim (God), whereas, throughout the <i>second</i>
account, as well as the story of the Fall, he is always called
Jehovah Elohim (Lord God), except when the writer seems to
abstain, for some reason, from placing the name Jehovah in the
mouth of the serpent.<a name="FNanchor_6:14_29" id="FNanchor_6:14_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:14_29" class="fnanchor">[6:14]</a> This accounts naturally for the
above contradictions. It would appear that, for some reason,
the productions of two pens have been here united, without any
reference to their inconsistencies."<a name="FNanchor_6:15_30" id="FNanchor_6:15_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:15_30" class="fnanchor">[6:15]</a></p></div>

<p>Dr. Kalisch, who does his utmost to maintain&mdash;as far as his knowledge of
the truth will allow&mdash;the general historical veracity of this narrative,
after speaking of the <i>first</i> account of the Creation, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"But now the narrative seems not only to pause, but to go
backward. The grand and powerful climax seems at once broken
off, and a languid repetition appears to follow. <i>Another
cosmogony is introduced, which, to complete the perplexity,
is, in many important features, in direct contradiction to the
former.</i></p>

<p>"<i>It would be dishonesty to conceal these difficulties. It
would be weakmindedness and cowardice. It would be flight
instead of combat. It would be an ignoble retreat, instead of
victory. We confess there is an apparent dissonance.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_6:16_31" id="FNanchor_6:16_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:16_31" class="fnanchor">[6:16]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p><p>Dr. Knappert says:<a name="FNanchor_7:1_32" id="FNanchor_7:1_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_7:1_32" class="fnanchor">[7:1]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The account of the Creation from the hand of the <i>Priestly
author</i> is utterly different from the <i>other narrative</i>,
beginning at the fourth verse of Genesis ii. Here we are told
that God created Heaven and Earth in six days, and rested on
the <i>seventh</i> day, obviously with a view to bring out the
holiness of the Sabbath in a strong light."</p></div>

<p>Now that we have seen there are two different and contradictory accounts
of the Creation, to be found in the first two chapters of Genesis, we
will endeavor to learn if there is sufficient reason to believe they are
copies of <i>more ancient legends</i>.</p>

<p>We have seen that, according to the first account, God divided the work
of creation into <i>six</i> days. This idea agrees with that of the ancient
<i>Persians</i>.</p>

<p>The Zend-Avesta&mdash;the sacred writings of the Parsees&mdash;states that the
Supreme being Ahuramazd&acirc; (Ormuzd), created the universe and man in <i>six</i>
successive periods of time, in the following order: First, the Heavens;
second, the Waters; third, the Earth; fourth, the Trees and Plants;
fifth, Animals; and sixth, Man. After the Creator had finished his work,
he rested.<a name="FNanchor_7:2_33" id="FNanchor_7:2_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_7:2_33" class="fnanchor">[7:2]</a></p>

<p>The Avesta account of the Creation is limited to this announcement, but
we find a more detailed history of the origin of the human species in
the book entitled <i>Bundehesh</i>, dedicated to the exposition of a complete
cosmogony. This book states that Ahuramazd&acirc; created the first man and
women joined together at the back. After dividing them, he endowed them
with motion and activity, placed within them an intelligent soul, and
bade them "to be humble of heart; to observe the law; to be pure in
their thoughts, pure in their speech, pure in their actions." Thus were
born Mashya and Mashy&acirc;na, the pair from which all human beings are
descended.<a name="FNanchor_7:3_34" id="FNanchor_7:3_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_7:3_34" class="fnanchor">[7:3]</a></p>

<p>The idea brought out in this story of the first human pair having
originally formed a single androgynous being with two faces, separated
later into two personalities by the Creator, is to be found in the
Genesis account (v. 2). "Male and female created he them, and blessed
them, and named their name Adam." Jewish tradition in the Targum and
Talmud, as well as among learned rabbis, allege that Adam was created
man and woman at the same time, having two faces turned in two opposite
directions, and that the Creator separated the feminine half from him,
in order to make of her a distinct person.<a name="FNanchor_7:4_35" id="FNanchor_7:4_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_7:4_35" class="fnanchor">[7:4]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p><p>The ancient <i>Etruscan</i> legend, according to Delitzsch, is almost the
same as the Persian. They relate that God created the world in <i>six</i>
thousand years. In the first thousand he created the Heaven and Earth;
in the second, the Firmament; in the third, the Waters of the Earth; in
the fourth, the Sun, Moon and Stars; in the fifth, the Animals belonging
to air, water and land; and in the sixth, Man alone.<a name="FNanchor_8:1_36" id="FNanchor_8:1_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_8:1_36" class="fnanchor">[8:1]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Delitzsch, who maintains to the utmost the historical truth of the
Scripture story in Genesis, yet says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Whence comes the surprising agreement of the <i>Etruscan</i> and
<i>Persian</i> legends with this section? How comes it that the
<i>Babylonian</i> cosmogony in Berosus, and the <i>Ph&oelig;nician</i> in
Sanchoniathon, in spite of their fantastical oddity, come in
contact with it in remarkable details?"</p></div>

<p>After showing some of the similarities in the legends of these different
nations, he continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"These are only instances of that which they have in common.
<i>For such an account outside of Israel, we must, however,
conclude, that the author of Genesis i. has no vision before
him, but a tradition.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_8:2_37" id="FNanchor_8:2_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_8:2_37" class="fnanchor">[8:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Von Bohlen tells us that the old <i>Chald&aelig;an</i> cosmogony is also <i>the
same</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8:3_38" id="FNanchor_8:3_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_8:3_38" class="fnanchor">[8:3]</a></p>

<p>To continue the <i>Persian</i> legend; we will now show that according to it,
after the Creation man was tempted, and <i>fell</i>. Kalisch<a name="FNanchor_8:4_39" id="FNanchor_8:4_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_8:4_39" class="fnanchor">[8:4]</a> and Bishop
Colenso<a name="FNanchor_8:5_40" id="FNanchor_8:5_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_8:5_40" class="fnanchor">[8:5]</a> tell us of the Persian legend that the first couple lived
originally in purity and innocence. Perpetual happiness was promised
them by the Creator if they persevered in their virtue. But an evil
demon came to them in the form of a <i>serpent</i>, sent by Ahriman, the
prince of devils, and gave them fruit of a wonderful <i>tree</i>, which
imparted immortality. Evil inclinations then entered their hearts, and
all their moral excellence was destroyed. Consequently they fell, and
forfeited the eternal happiness for which they were destined. They
killed beasts, and clothed themselves in their skins. The evil demon
obtained still more perfect power over their minds, and called forth
envy, hatred, discord, and rebellion, which raged in the bosom of the
families.</p>

<p>Since the above was written, Mr. George Smith, of the British Museum,
has discovered cuneiform inscriptions, which show conclusively that the
Babylonians had this legend of the Creation and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>Fall of Man, some 1,500
years or more before the Hebrews heard of it.<a name="FNanchor_9:1_41" id="FNanchor_9:1_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_9:1_41" class="fnanchor">[9:1]</a> The cuneiform
inscriptions relating to the Babylonian legend of the Creation and Fall
of Man, which have been discovered by English arch&aelig;ologists, are not,
however, complete. The portions which relate to the <i>Tree</i> and <i>Serpent</i>
have not been found, but Babylonian gem engravings show that these
incidents were evidently a part of the original legend.<a name="FNanchor_9:2_42" id="FNanchor_9:2_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_9:2_42" class="fnanchor">[9:2]</a> The <i>Tree
of Life</i> in the Genesis account appears to correspond with the sacred
grove of Anu, which was guarded by a sword turning to all the four
points of the compass.<a name="FNanchor_9:3_43" id="FNanchor_9:3_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_9:3_43" class="fnanchor">[9:3]</a> A representation of this Sacred Tree, with
"<i>attendant cherubim</i>," copied from an Assyrian cylinder, may be seen in
Mr. George Smith's "Chaldean Account of Genesis."<a name="FNanchor_9:4_44" id="FNanchor_9:4_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_9:4_44" class="fnanchor">[9:4]</a> <a href="#Fig_1">Figure No. 1</a>,
which we have taken from the same work,[9:5] shows the tree of
knowledge, fruit, and the serpent. Mr. Smith says of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"One striking and important specimen of early type in the
British Museum collection, has two figures sitting one on each
side of a <i>tree</i>, holding out their hands to the fruit, while
at the back of one (the <i>woman</i>) is scratched a <i>serpent</i>. We
know well that in these early sculptures none of these figures
were chance devices, but all represented events, or supposed
events, and figures in their legends; thus it is evident that
a form of the story of the Fall, similar to that of Genesis,
was known in early times in Babylonia."<a name="FNanchor_9:5_45" id="FNanchor_9:5_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_9:5_45" class="fnanchor">[9:5]</a></p></div>

</div>

<p>This illustration might be used to illustrate the narrative of
<i>Genesis</i>, and as Friedrich Delitzsch has remarked (G. Smith's
<i>Chald&auml;ische Genesis</i>) is capable of no other explanation.</p>

<p>M. Renan does not hesitate to join forces with the ancient commentators,
in seeking to recover a trace of the same tradition among the Phenicians
in the fragments of Sanchoniathon, translated into Greek by Philo of
Byblos. In fact, it is there said, in speaking of the first human pair,
and of &AElig;on, which seems to be the translation of <i>Havv&acirc;h</i> (in Phenician
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><i>Hav&acirc;th</i>) and stands in her relation to the other members of the pair,
that this personage "has found out how to obtain nourishment from the
fruits of the tree."</p>

<p>The idea of the Edenic happiness of the first human beings constitutes
one of the universal traditions. Among the Egyptians, the terrestrial
reign of the god R&acirc;, who inaugurated the existence of the world and of
human life, was a golden age to which they continually looked back with
regret and envy. Its "like has never been seen since."</p>

<p>The ancient Greeks boasted of their "Golden Age," when sorrow and
trouble were not known. Hesiod, an ancient Grecian poet, describes it
thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Men lived like Gods, without vices or passions, vexation or
toil. In happy companionship with divine beings, they passed
their days in tranquillity and joy, living together in perfect
equality, united by mutual confidence and love. The earth was
more beautiful than now, and spontaneously yielded an abundant
variety of fruits. Human beings and animals spoke the same
language and conversed with each other. Men were considered
mere boys at a hundred years old. They had none of the
infirmities of age to trouble them, and when they passed to
regions of superior life, it was in a gentle slumber.<ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins></p></div>

<p>In the course of time, however, all the sorrows and troubles came to
man. They were caused by inquisitiveness. The story is as follows:
Epimetheus received a gift from Zeus (God), in the form of a beautiful
woman (Pandora).</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"She brought with her a vase, the lid of which was (by the
command of God), to remain closed. The curiosity of her
husband, however, tempted him to open it, and suddenly there
escaped from it troubles, weariness and illness from which
mankind was never afterwards free. All that remained was
<i>hope</i>."<a name="FNanchor_10:1_46" id="FNanchor_10:1_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_10:1_46" class="fnanchor">[10:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Among the <i>Thibetans</i>, the paradisiacal condition was more complete and
spiritual. The desire to eat of a certain sweet herb deprived men of
their spiritual life. There arose a sense of shame, and the need to
clothe themselves. Necessity compelled them to agriculture; the virtues
disappeared, and murder, adultery and other vices, stepped into their
place.<a name="FNanchor_10:2_47" id="FNanchor_10:2_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_10:2_47" class="fnanchor">[10:2]</a></p>

<p>The idea that the Fall of the human race is connected with <i>agriculture</i>
is found to be also often represented in the legends of the East African
negroes, especially in the Calabar legend of the Creation, which
presents many interesting points of comparison with the biblical story
of the Fall. The first human pair are called by a bell at meal-times to
Abasi (the Calabar God), in heaven; and in place of the forbidden tree
of Genesis are put <i>agriculture</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>and <i>propagation</i>, which Abasi
strictly denies to the first pair. The Fall is denoted by the
transgression of both these commands, especially through the use of
implements of tillage, to which the <i>woman</i> is tempted by a female
friend who is given to her. From that moment man fell <i>and became
mortal</i>, so that, as the Bible story has it, he can eat bread only in
the sweat of his face. There agriculture is a curse, a fall from a more
perfect stage to a lower and imperfect one.<a name="FNanchor_11:1_48" id="FNanchor_11:1_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_11:1_48" class="fnanchor">[11:1]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Kalisch, writing of the Garden of Eden, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>Paradise</i> is no exclusive feature of the early history
of the Hebrews. <i>Most of the ancient nations have similar
narratives about a happy abode, which care does not approach,
and which re-echoes with the sounds of the purest
bliss.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_11:2_49" id="FNanchor_11:2_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_11:2_49" class="fnanchor">[11:2]</a></p></div>

<p>The <i>Persians</i> supposed that a region of bliss and delight called
<i>Heden</i>, more beautiful than all the rest of the world, <i>traversed by a
mighty river</i>, was the original abode of the first men, before they were
tempted by the evil spirit in the form of a <i>serpent</i>, to partake of the
fruit of the forbidden tree <i>H&ocirc;m</i>.<a name="FNanchor_11:3_50" id="FNanchor_11:3_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_11:3_50" class="fnanchor">[11:3]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Delitzsch, writing of the <i>Persian</i> legend, observes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Innumerable attendants of the Holy One keep watch against the
attempts of Ahriman, over the tree <i>H&ocirc;m</i>, which contains in
itself the power of the resurrection.<ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_11:4_51" id="FNanchor_11:4_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_11:4_51" class="fnanchor">[11:4]</a></p></div>

<p>The ancient Greeks had a tradition concerning the "Islands of the
Blessed," the "Elysium," on the borders of the earth, abounding in every
charm of life, and the "Garden of the Hesperides," the Paradise, in
which grew a <i>tree</i> bearing the golden apples of Immortality. It was
guarded by three nymphs, and a Serpent, or Dragon, the ever-watchful
Ladon. It was one of the labors of Hercules to gather some of these
apples of life. When he arrived there he found the garden protected by a
<i>Dragon</i>. Ancient medallions represent a tree with a serpent twined
around it. Hercules has gathered an apple, and near him stand the three
nymphs, called Hesperides.<a name="FNanchor_11:5_52" id="FNanchor_11:5_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_11:5_52" class="fnanchor">[11:5]</a> This is simply a parallel of the Eden
myth.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Faber, speaking of <i>Hercules</i>, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On the <i>Sphere</i> he is represented in the act of contending
with the Serpent, the head of which is placed under his foot;
and this Serpent, we are told, is that which guarded the tree
with golden fruit in the midst of the garden of the
Hesperides. But the garden of the Hesperides <i>was none other
than the garden of Paradise</i>; consequently the serpent of that
garden, the head of which is crushed beneath the heel of
Hercules, and which itself is described as encircling with its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>folds the trunk of the mysterious tree, must necessarily be a
transcript of that Serpent whose form was assumed by the
tempter of our first parents. We may observe the same ancient
tradition in the Ph&oelig;nician fable representing Ophion or
Ophioneus."<a name="FNanchor_12:1_53" id="FNanchor_12:1_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_12:1_53" class="fnanchor">[12:1]</a></p></div>

<p>And Professor Fergusson says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Hercules'</i> adventures in the garden of the Hesperides, is
the Pagan form of the myth that most resembles the precious
Serpent-guarded fruit of the Garden of Eden, though the moral
of the fable is so widely different."<a name="FNanchor_12:2_54" id="FNanchor_12:2_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_12:2_54" class="fnanchor">[12:2]</a></p></div>

<p>The ancient <i>Egyptians</i> also had the legend of the "Tree of Life." It is
mentioned in their sacred books that Osiris ordered the names of some
souls to be written on this "Tree of Life," the fruit of which made
those who ate it to become as gods.<a name="FNanchor_12:3_55" id="FNanchor_12:3_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_12:3_55" class="fnanchor">[12:3]</a></p>

<p>Among the most ancient traditions of the <i>Hindoos</i>, is that of the "Tree
of Life"&mdash;called <i>S&ocirc;ma</i> in Sanskrit&mdash;the juice of which imparted
immortality. This most wonderful tree was guarded by spirits.<a name="FNanchor_12:4_56" id="FNanchor_12:4_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_12:4_56" class="fnanchor">[12:4]</a></p>

<p>Still more striking is the Hindoo legend of the "Elysium" or "Paradise,"
which is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the sacred mountain <i>Meru</i>, which is perpetually clothed
in the golden rays of the Sun, and whose lofty summit reaches
into heaven, no sinful man can exist. <i>It is guarded by a
dreadful dragon.</i> It is adorned with many celestial plants and
trees, and is watered by <i>four rivers</i>, which thence separate
and flow to the four chief directions."<a name="FNanchor_12:5_57" id="FNanchor_12:5_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_12:5_57" class="fnanchor">[12:5]</a></p></div>

<p>The Hindoos, like the philosophers of the Ionic school (Thales, for
instance), held <i>water</i> to be the first existing and all-pervading
principle, at the same time allowing the co-operation and influence of
an <i>immaterial</i> intelligence in the work of creation.<a name="FNanchor_12:6_58" id="FNanchor_12:6_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_12:6_58" class="fnanchor">[12:6]</a> A Vedic
poet, meditating on the Creation, uses the following expressions:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Nothing that is was then, even what is not, did not exist
then." "There was no space, no life, and lastly there was no
time, no difference between day and night, no solar torch by
which morning might have been told from evening." "Darkness
there was, and all at first was veiled in gloom profound, as
ocean without light."<a name="FNanchor_12:7_59" id="FNanchor_12:7_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_12:7_59" class="fnanchor">[12:7]</a></p></div>

<p>The Hindoo legend approaches very nearly to that preserved in the Hebrew
Scriptures. Thus, it is said that Siva, as the Supreme Being, desired to
tempt Brahm&aacute; (who had taken human form, and was called Swayambhura&mdash;son
of the self-existent), and for this object he dropped from heaven a
blossom of the sacred <i>fig</i> tree.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p><p>Swayambhura, instigated by his wife, Satarupa, endeavors to obtain this
blossom, thinking its possession will render him immortal and divine;
but when he has succeeded in doing so, he is cursed by Siva, and doomed
to misery and degradation.<a name="FNanchor_13:1_60" id="FNanchor_13:1_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_13:1_60" class="fnanchor">[13:1]</a> The sacred Indian <i>fig</i> is endowed by
the Brahmins and the Buddhists with mysterious significance, as the
"Tree of Knowledge" or "Intelligence."<a name="FNanchor_13:2_61" id="FNanchor_13:2_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_13:2_61" class="fnanchor">[13:2]</a></p>

<p>There is no Hindoo legend of the <i>Creation</i> similar to the Persian and
Hebrew accounts, and Ceylon was never believed to have been the Paradise
or home of our first parents, although such stories are in
circulation.<a name="FNanchor_13:3_62" id="FNanchor_13:3_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_13:3_62" class="fnanchor">[13:3]</a> The Hindoo religion states&mdash;as we have already
seen&mdash;Mount Meru to be the Paradise, out of which went <i>four rivers</i>.</p>

<p>We have noticed that the "Gardens of Paradise" are said to have been
guarded by <i>Dragons</i>, and that, according to the Genesis account, it was
Cherubim that protected Eden. This apparent difference in the legends is
owing to the fact that we have come in our modern times to speak of
Cherub as though it were an other name for an Angel. But the Cherub of
the writer of Genesis, the Cherub of Assyria, the Cherub of Babylon, the
Cherub of the entire Orient, at the time the Eden story was written, was
not at all an Angel, but an animal, and a mythological one at that. The
Cherub had, in some cases, the body of a lion, with the head of an other
animal, or a man, and the wings of a bird. In Ezekiel they have the body
of a man, whose head, besides a human countenance, has also that of a
<i>Lion</i>, an <i>Ox</i> and an <i>Eagle</i>. They are provided with four wings, and
the whole body is spangled with innumerable eyes. In Assyria and Babylon
they appear as winged bulls with human faces, and are placed at the
gateways of palaces and temples as guardian genii who watch over the
dwelling, as the Cherubim in Genesis watch the "Tree of Life."</p>

<p>Most Jewish writers and Christian Fathers conceived the Cherubim as
Angels. Most theologians also considered them as Angels, until Michaelis
showed them to be a mythological animal, a poetical creation.<a name="FNanchor_13:4_63" id="FNanchor_13:4_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_13:4_63" class="fnanchor">[13:4]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p><p>We see then, that our <i>Cherub</i> is simply a <i>Dragon</i>.</p>

<p>To continue our inquiry regarding the prevalence of the Eden-myth among
nations of antiquity.</p>

<p>The <i>Chinese</i> have their Age of Virtue, when nature furnished abundant
food, and man lived peacefully, surrounded by all the beasts. In their
sacred books there is a story concerning a mysterious <i>garden</i>, where
grew a <i>tree</i> bearing "apples of immortality," guarded by a winged
serpent, called a Dragon. They describe a primitive age of the world,
when the earth yielded abundance of delicious fruits without
cultivation, and the seasons were untroubled by wind and storms. There
was no calamity, sickness, or death. Men were then good without effort;
for the human heart was in harmony with the peacefulness and beauty of
nature.</p>

<p>The "Golden Age" of the past is much dwelt upon by their ancient
commentators. One of them says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"All places were then equally the native county of every man.
Flocks wandered in the fields without any guide; birds filled
the air with their melodious voices; and the fruits grew of
their own accord. Men lived pleasantly with the animals, and
all creatures were members of the same family. Ignorant of
evil, man lived in simplicity and perfect innocence."</p></div>

<p>Another commentator says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the first age of perfect purity, all was in harmony, and
the passions did not occasion the slightest murmur. Man,
united to sovereign reason within, conformed his outward
actions to sovereign justice. Far from all duplicity and
falsehood, his soul received marvelous felicity from heaven,
and the purest delights from earth."</p></div>

<p>Another says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A delicious <i>garden</i> refreshed with zephyrs, and planted with
odoriferous trees, was situated in the middle of a mountain,
which was the avenue of heaven. The <i>waters</i> that moistened it
flowed from a source called the '<i>Fountain of Immortality</i>'.
He who drinks of it never dies. Thence flowed <i>four rivers</i>. A
Golden River, betwixt the South and East, a Red River, between
the North and East, the River of the Lamb between the North
and West."</p></div>

<p>The animal Kaiming guards the entrance.</p>

<p>Partly by an undue thirst for knowledge, and partly by increasing
sensuality, and the seduction of <i>woman</i>, man fell. Then passion and
lust ruled in the human mind, and war with the animals began. In one of
the Chinese sacred volumes, called the Chi-King, it is said that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"All was subject to man at first, <i>but a woman threw us into
slavery</i>. The wise husband raised up a bulwark of walls, <i>but
the woman, by an ambitious desire of knowledge, demolished
them</i>. Our misery did not come from heaven, <i>but from a
woman</i>. <i>She lost the human race.</i> Ah, unhappy <i>Poo See!</i> thou
kindled the fire <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>that consumes us, and which is every day
augmenting. Our misery has lasted many ages. <i>The world is
lost.</i> Vice overflows all things like a mortal poison."<a name="FNanchor_15:1_64" id="FNanchor_15:1_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_15:1_64" class="fnanchor">[15:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Thus we see that the Chinese are no strangers to the doctrine of
original sin. It is their invariable belief that man is a fallen being;
admitted by them from time immemorial.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of <i>Madagascar</i> had a legend similar to the Eden story,
which is related as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The first man was created of the <i>dust of the earth</i>, and was
placed in a <i>garden</i>, where he was subject to none of the ills
which now affect mortality; he was also free from all bodily
appetites, and though surrounded by delicious <i>fruit</i> and
limpid <i>streams</i> yet felt no desire to taste of the fruit or
to quaff the water. The Creator had, moreover, <i>strictly
forbid him either to eat or to drink</i>. The great enemy,
however, came to him, and painted to him, in glowing colors,
the sweetness of the apple, and the lusciousness of the date,
and the succulence of the orange."</p></div>

<p>After resisting the temptations for a while, he at last ate of the
fruit, and consequently <i>fell</i>.<a name="FNanchor_15:2_65" id="FNanchor_15:2_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_15:2_65" class="fnanchor">[15:2]</a></p>

<p>A legend of the Creation, similar to the Hebrew, was found by Mr. Ellis
among the <i>Tahitians</i>, and appeared in his "Polynesian Researches." It
is as follows:</p>

<p>After Taarao had formed the world, he created man out of ar&aelig;a, red
earth, which was also the food of man until bread was made. Taarao one
day called for the man by name. When he came, he caused him to fall
asleep, and while he slept, he took out one of his <i>ivi</i>, or bones, and
with it made a woman, whom he gave to the man as his wife, and they
became the progenitors of mankind. The woman's name was <i>Ivi</i>, which
signifies a bone.<a name="FNanchor_15:3_66" id="FNanchor_15:3_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_15:3_66" class="fnanchor">[15:3]</a></p>

<p>The prose Edda, of the ancient <i>Scandinavians</i>, speaks of the "Golden
Age" when all was pure and harmonious. This age lasted until the arrival
of <i>woman</i> out of Jotunheim&mdash;the region of the giants, a sort of "land
of Nod"&mdash;who corrupted it.<a name="FNanchor_15:4_67" id="FNanchor_15:4_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_15:4_67" class="fnanchor">[15:4]</a></p>

<p>In the annals of the <i>Mexicans</i>, the first woman, whose name was
translated by the old Spanish writers, "the woman of our flesh," is
always represented as accompanied by a great male serpent, who seems to
be talking to her. Some writers believe this to be the <i>tempter</i>
speaking to the primeval mother, and others that it is intended to
represent the <i>father</i> of the human race. This Mexican Eve is

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A striking instance is recorded by the very intelligent
traveler (Wilson), regarding a representation of the Fall of
our first parents, sculptured in the magnificent temple of
Ipsambul, in Nubia. He says that a very exact representation
of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden is to be seen in that
cave, and that the <i>serpent</i> climbing round the tree is
especially delineated, and the whole subject of the tempting
of our first parents most accurately exhibited."<a name="FNanchor_16:1_69" id="FNanchor_16:1_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_16:1_69" class="fnanchor">[16:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Nearly the same thing was found by Colonel Coombs in the <i>South of
India</i>. Colonel Tod, in his "Hist. Rajapoutana," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A drawing, brought by Colonel Coombs from a sculptured column
in a cave-temple in the South of India, represents the first
pair at the foot of the ambrosial tree, and a <i>serpent</i>
entwined among the heavily-laden boughs, presenting to them
some of the fruit from his mouth. The tempter appears to be at
that part of his discourse, when</p></div>

<span class="i0">'&mdash;&mdash;his words, replete with guile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Into her heart too easy entrance won:<br /></span>

</div></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>This is a curious subject to be engraved on an ancient Pagan
temple.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_16:2_70" id="FNanchor_16:2_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_16:2_70" class="fnanchor">[16:2]</a></p></div>

<p>So the Colonel thought, no doubt, but it is not so very curious after
all. It is the same myth which we have found&mdash;with but such small
variations only as time and circumstances may be expected to
produce&mdash;among different nations, in both the Old and New Worlds.</p>

<p>Fig. No. 2, taken from the work of Montfaucon,<a name="FNanchor_16:3_71" id="FNanchor_16:3_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_16:3_71" class="fnanchor">[16:3]</a> represents one of
these ancient Pagan sculptures. Can any one doubt that it is allusive to
the myth of which we have been treating in this chapter?</p>

<p>That man was originally created a perfect being, and is now only a
fallen and broken remnant of what he once was, we have seen to be a
piece of <i>mythology</i>, not only unfounded in fact, but, beyond
intelligent question, proved untrue. What, then, is the significance of
the exposure of this myth? What does its loss as a scientific fact, and
as a portion of Christian dogma, imply? It implies that with
it&mdash;although many Christian divines who admit this to be a legend, do
not, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>or do not <i>profess</i>, to see it&mdash;<i>must fall the whole Orthodox
scheme, for upon this</i> <span class="allcapsc">MYTH</span> <i>the theology of Christendom is built</i>. The
doctrine of the <i>inspiration of the Scriptures</i>, the <i>Fall</i> of <i>man</i>,
his <i>total depravity</i>, the <i>Incarnation</i>, the <i>Atonement</i>, the <i>devil</i>,
<i>hell</i>, in fact, the entire theology of the Christian church, falls to
pieces with the historical inaccuracy of this story, <i>for upon it is it
built; 'tis the foundation of the whole structure</i>.<a name="FNanchor_17:1_72" id="FNanchor_17:1_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_17:1_72" class="fnanchor">[17:1]</a></p>

<p>According to Christian dogma, the Incarnation of Christ Jesus had become
necessary, merely <i>because he had to redeem the evil introduced into the
world by the Fall of man</i>. These two dogmas cannot be separated from
each other. <i>If there was no Fall, there is no need of an atonement, and
no Redeemer is required.</i> Those, then, who consent in recognizing in
Christ Jesus a <i>God</i> and <i>Redeemer</i>, and who, notwithstanding, cannot
resolve upon admitting the story of the Fall of man to be <i>historical</i>,
should exculpate themselves from the reproach of <i>inconsistency</i>. There
are a great number, however, in this position at the present day.</p>

<p>Although, as we have said, many Christian divines do not, or do not
profess to, see the force of the above argument, there are many who do;
and they, regardless of their scientific learning, cling to these old
myths, professing to believe them, <i>well knowing what must follow with
their fall</i>. The following, though written some years ago, will serve to
illustrate this style of reasoning.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Manchester (England) writing in the "Manchester Examiner
and Times," said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The very <i>foundation of our faith</i>, the very <i>basis of our
hopes</i>, the very nearest and dearest of our consolations are
taken from us, <i>when one line of that sacred volume, on which
we base everything, is declared to be untruthful and
untrustworthy</i>."</p></div>

<p>The "English Churchman," speaking of clergymen who have "<i>doubts</i>,"
said, that any who are not throughly persuaded "<i>that the Scriptures
cannot in any particular be untrue</i>," should leave the Church.</p>

<p>The Rev. E. Garbett, M. A., in a sermon preached before the University
of Oxford, speaking of the "<i>historical truth</i>" of the Bible, said:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"It is the clear teaching of those doctrinal formularies, to
which we of the Church of England have expressed our solemn
assent, <i>and no honest interpretation of her language can get
rid of it</i>."</p></div>

<p>And that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In all consistent reason, <i>we must accept the whole of the
inspired autographs, or reject the whole</i>."</p></div>

<p>Dr. Baylee, Principal of a theological university&mdash;<i>St. Aiden's
College</i>&mdash;at Birkenhead, England, and author of a "Manual," called
Baylee's "<i>Verbal Inspiration</i>," written "<i>chiefly for the youths of St.
Aiden's College</i>," makes use of the following words, in that work:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>The whole Bible</i>, as a revelation, is a declaration of the
mind of God towards his creatures on all the subjects of which
the Bible treats."</p>

<p>"<i>The Bible is God's word</i>, in the same sense as if he had
made use of no human agent, but had <i>Himself spoken it</i>."</p>

<p>"The Bible cannot be less than verbally inspired. <i>Every word,
every syllable, every letter</i>, is just what it would be, had
God spoken from heaven without any human intervention."</p>

<p>"Every scientific statement is infallibly correct, all its
history and narrations of every kind, <i>are without any
inaccuracy</i>."<a name="FNanchor_18:1_73" id="FNanchor_18:1_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_18:1_73" class="fnanchor">[18:1]</a></p></div>

<p>"It is well known that when the science of geology first arose, it was

letter of Scripture. There was, there are perhaps still, two modes of
reconciliation of Scripture and science, which have been each in their
day attempted, <i>and each have totally and deservedly failed</i>. One is the
endeavor to wrest the words of the Bible from their natural meaning,
<i>and force it to speak the language of science</i>." After speaking of the
earliest known example, which was the interpolation of the word "<i>not</i>"
in Leviticus xi. 6, he continues: "This is the earliest instance of <i>the
falsification of Scripture to meet the demands of science</i>; and it has
been followed in later times by the various efforts which have been made
to twist the earlier chapters of the book of Genesis into <i>apparent</i>
agreement with the last results of geology&mdash;representing days not to be
days, morning and evening not to be morning and evening, the deluge not
to be the deluge, and the ark not to be the ark."</p></div>

a "very discreditable performance," and "a disgraceful piece of

to Hindoo legend, the first man and woman were called "Adima and Heva,"
which is certainly not the case. The "bridge of Adima" which he speaks
of as connecting the island of Ceylon with the mainland, is called
"Rama's bridge;" and the "Adam's footprints" are called "Buddha's
footprints." The Portuguese, who called the mountain <i>Pico d' Adama</i>
(Adam's Peak), evidently invented these other names. (See Maurice's

<h3>THE DELUGE.<a name="FNanchor_19:1_75" id="FNanchor_19:1_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_19:1_75" class="fnanchor" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 70%;">[19:1]</a></h3>


<p>After "man's shameful fall," the earth began to be populated at a very
rapid rate. "The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were
fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There were
<i>giants</i> in the earth in those days,<a name="FNanchor_19:2_76" id="FNanchor_19:2_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_19:2_76" class="fnanchor">[19:2]</a> and also .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. mighty men .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
men of renown."</p>

<p>But these "giants" and "mighty men" were very wicked, "and God saw the
wickedness of man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>and it repented the Lord that he had made man
upon the earth</i>,<a name="FNanchor_19:3_77" id="FNanchor_19:3_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_19:3_77" class="fnanchor">[19:3]</a> and it grieved him at his heart. And the Lord
said; I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth,
both man and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air,
for it repenteth me that I have made them. But Noah found grace in the
eyes of the Lord (for) Noah was a just man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and walked with God.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me, for the
earth is filled with violence through them, and, behold, I will <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>destroy
them with the earth. Make thee an ark of gopher wood, rooms shalt thou
make in the ark, (and) a window shalt thou make to the ark; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And
behold I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy
all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven, and every
thing that is in the earth shall die. But with thee shall I establish my
covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy
wife, and thy sons' wives, with thee. And of every living thing of all
flesh, <i>two</i> of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them
alive with thee; they shall be male and female. Of fowls after their
kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the
earth after his kind, <i>two</i> of every sort shall come in to thee, to keep
them alive. And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou
shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee and for them.
<i>Thus did Noah, according to all that God commanded him.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_20:1_78" id="FNanchor_20:1_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_20:1_78" class="fnanchor">[20:1]</a></p>

<p>When the ark was finished, the Lord said unto Noah:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Come thou and all thy house into the ark.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Of every clean
beast thou shalt take to thee by <i>sevens</i>, the male and his
female; and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and
his female. Of fowls also of the air by <i>sevens</i>, the male and
the female."<a name="FNanchor_20:2_79" id="FNanchor_20:2_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_20:2_79" class="fnanchor">[20:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Here, again, as in the Eden myth, there is a <i>contradiction</i>. We have
seen that the Lord told Noah to bring into the ark "of every living
thing, of all flesh, <i>two</i> of <i>every sort</i>," and now that the ark is
finished, we are told that he said to him: "Of every clean beast thou
shalt take to thee by <i>sevens</i>," and, "of fowls also of the air by
<i>sevens</i>." This is owing to the story having been written by <i>two
different writers</i>&mdash;the Jehovistic, and the Elohistic&mdash;one of which took
from, and added to the narrative of the other.<a name="FNanchor_20:3_80" id="FNanchor_20:3_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_20:3_80" class="fnanchor">[20:3]</a> The account goes on
to say, that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives
with him, into the ark.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Of <i>clean</i> beasts, and of beasts
<i>that are not clean</i>, and of <i>fowls</i>, and of <i>every thing</i>
that creepeth upon the earth, there went in <i>two and two</i>,
unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, <i>as God had
commanded Noah</i>."<a name="FNanchor_20:4_81" id="FNanchor_20:4_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_20:4_81" class="fnanchor">[20:4]</a></p></div>

<p>We see, then, that Noah took into the ark <i>of all kinds</i> of beasts, of
<i>fowls</i>, and of every thing that creepeth, <i>two of every sort</i>, and that
this was "<i>as God had commanded Noah</i>." This clearly shows that the
writer of these words knew nothing of the command <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>to take in <i>clean
beasts</i>, and <i>fowls</i> of the air, by <i>sevens</i>. We are further assured,
that, "<i>Noah did according to all that the Lord commanded him</i>."</p>

<p>After Noah and his family, and every beast after his kind, and all the
cattle after their kind, the fowls of the air, and every creeping thing,
had entered the ark, the Lord shut them in. Then "were all the fountains
of the great deep broken up, <i>and the windows of heaven were opened</i>.
And the rain was upon the earth <i>forty days and forty nights</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And
the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the hills, that
were under the whole heaven, were covered. Fifteen cubits upwards did
the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. And all flesh died
that moved upon the earth, both of fowl and of cattle, and of beast, and
of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man. And
Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark."<a name="FNanchor_21:1_82" id="FNanchor_21:1_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_21:1_82" class="fnanchor">[21:1]</a>
The object of the flood was now accomplished, "<i>all flesh died that
moved upon the earth</i>." The Lord, therefore, "made a wind to pass over
the earth, and the waters assuaged. The fountains of the deep, and the
windows of heaven, were stopped, and the rain from heaven was
restrained. And the waters decreased continually.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And it came to pass
at the end of <i>forty days</i>, that Noah opened the window of the ark,
which he had made. And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and
fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. He also sent
forth a dove, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot,
and she returned unto him into the ark." .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>At the end of <i>seven</i> days he again "sent forth the dove out of the ark,
and the dove came in to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth was an
olive leaf, plucked off."</p>

<p>At the end of another <i>seven</i> days, he again "sent forth the dove, which
returned not again to him any more."</p>

<p>And the ark rested in the <i>seventh</i> month, on the seventeenth day of the
month, upon the mountains of Ararat. Then Noah and his wife, and his
sons, and his sons' wives, and every living thing that was in the ark,
went forth out of the ark. "And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and offered burnt offerings on the altar. And the Lord smelled a sweet
savour, and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the
ground any more for man's sake."<a name="FNanchor_21:2_83" id="FNanchor_21:2_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_21:2_83" class="fnanchor">[21:2]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p><p>We shall now see that there is scarcely any considerable race of men
among whom there does not exist, in some form, the tradition of a great
deluge, which destroyed all the human race, except <i>their own</i>
progenitors.</p>

<p>The first of these which we shall notice, and the one with which the
Hebrew agrees most closely, having been copied from it,<a name="FNanchor_22:1_84" id="FNanchor_22:1_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_22:1_84" class="fnanchor">[22:1]</a> is the
<i>Chaldean</i>, as given by Berosus, the Chaldean historian.<a name="FNanchor_22:2_85" id="FNanchor_22:2_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_22:2_85" class="fnanchor">[22:2]</a> It is as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"After the death of Ardates (the ninth king of the Chaldeans),
his son <i>Xisuthrus</i> reigned eighteen sari. In his time
happened a great <i>deluge</i>, the history of which is thus
described: The deity Cronos appeared to him (Xisuthrus) in a
vision, and warned him that upon the fifteenth day of the
month Desius there would be a flood, by which mankind would be
destroyed. He therefore enjoined him to write a history of the
beginning, procedure, and conclusion of all things, and to
bury it in the City of the Sun at Sippara; and to build a
vessel, and take with him into it his friends and relations,
and to convey on board everything necessary to sustain life,
together with all the different animals, both birds and
quadrupeds, and trust himself fearlessly to the deep. Having
asked the deity whither he was to sail, he was answered: 'To
the Gods;' upon which he offered up a prayer for the good of
mankind. He then obeyed the divine admonition, and built a
vessel five stadia in length, and two in breadth. Into this he
put everything which he had prepared, and last of all conveyed
into it his wife, his children, and his friends. After the
flood had been upon the earth, and was in time abated,
Xisuthrus sent out birds from the vessel; which not finding
any food, nor any place whereupon they might rest their feet,
returned to him again. After an interval of some days, he sent
them forth a second time; and they now returned with their
feet tinged with mud. He made a trial a third time with these
birds; but they returned to him no more: from whence he judged
that the surface of the earth had appeared above the waters.
He therefore made an opening in the vessel, and upon looking
out found that it was stranded upon the side of some mountain;
upon which he immediately quitted it with his wife, his
daughter, and the pilot. Xisuthrus then paid his adoration to
the earth, and, having constructed an altar, offered
sacrifices to the gods."<a name="FNanchor_22:3_86" id="FNanchor_22:3_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_22:3_86" class="fnanchor">[22:3]</a></p></div>

<p>This account, given by Berosus, which agrees in almost every particular
with that found in Genesis, and with that found by George Smith of the
British Museum on terra cotta tablets in Assyria, is nevertheless
different in some respects. But, says Mr. Smith:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When we consider the difference between the two countries of
Palestine and Babylonia, these variations do not appear
greater than we should expect.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was only natural that, in
relating the same stories, each nation should <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>color them in
accordance with its own ideas, and stress would naturally in
each case be laid upon points with which they were familiar.
Thus we should expect beforehand that there would be
differences in the narrative such as we actually find, and we
may also notice that the cuneiform account does not always
coincide even with the account of the same events given by
Berosus from Chaldean sources."<a name="FNanchor_23:1_87" id="FNanchor_23:1_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_23:1_87" class="fnanchor">[23:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The most important points are the same however, <i>i. e.</i>, <i>in both cases</i>
the virtuous man is informed by the Lord that a flood is about to take
place, which would destroy mankind. <i>In both cases</i> they are commanded
to build a vessel or ark, to enter it with their families, and to take
in beasts, birds, and everything that creepeth, also to provide
themselves with food. <i>In both cases</i> they send out a bird from the ark
<i>three times</i>&mdash;the third time it failed to return. <i>In both cases</i> they
land on a mountain, and upon leaving the ark they offer up a sacrifice
to the gods. Xisuthrus was the tenth king,<a name="FNanchor_23:2_88" id="FNanchor_23:2_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_23:2_88" class="fnanchor">[23:2]</a> and Noah the tenth
patriarch.<a name="FNanchor_23:3_89" id="FNanchor_23:3_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_23:3_89" class="fnanchor">[23:3]</a> Xisuthrus had three sons (Zerovanos, Titan and
Japetosthes),<a name="FNanchor_23:4_90" id="FNanchor_23:4_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_23:4_90" class="fnanchor">[23:4]</a> and Noah had three sons (Shem, Ham and
Japhet).<a name="FNanchor_23:5_91" id="FNanchor_23:5_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_23:5_91" class="fnanchor">[23:5]</a></p>

<p>As Cory remarks in his "Ancient Fragments," <ins class="corr" title="original has quotation mark followed by The">the</ins> history of the flood, as
given by Berosus, so remarkably corresponds with the Biblical account of
the Noachian Deluge, that no one can doubt that both proceeded from one

ancient document.<a name="FNanchor_23:6_92" id="FNanchor_23:6_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_23:6_92" class="fnanchor">[23:6]</a></p>

<p>This legend became known to the Jews from Chaldean sources,<a name="FNanchor_23:7_93" id="FNanchor_23:7_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_23:7_93" class="fnanchor">[23:7]</a> it was

<p>The <i>Hindoo</i> legend of the Deluge is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Many ages after the creation of the world, Brahma resolved to
destroy it with a deluge, on account of the wickedness of the
people. There lived at that time a pious man named
<i>Satyavrata</i>, and as the lord of the universe loved this pious
man, and wished to preserve him from the sea of destruction
which was to appear on account of the depravity of the age, he
appeared before him in the form of <i>Vishnu</i> (the Preserver)
and said: In <i>seven</i> days from the present time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the worlds
will be plunged in an ocean of death, but in the midst of the
destroying waves, a large vessel, sent by me for thy use,
shall stand before thee. Then shalt thou take all medicinal
herbs, all the variety of feeds, and, accompanied by <i>seven</i>
saints, encircled by <i>pairs</i> of all brute animals, thou shalt
enter the spacious ark, and continue in it, secure from the
flood, on one immense ocean without light, except the radiance
of thy holy companions. When the ship shall be agitated by an
impetuous wind, thou shalt fasten it with a large sea-serpent
on my horn; for I will be near thee (in the form of a fish),
drawing the vessel, with thee and thy attendants. I will
remain on the ocean, O chief of men, until a night of <i>Brahma</i>
shall be completely ended. Thou shalt then <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>know my true
greatness, rightly named the Supreme Godhead; by my favor, all
thy questions shall be answered, and thy mind abundantly
instructed."</p></div>

<p>Being thus directed, Satyavrata humbly waited for the time which the
ruler of our senses had appointed. It was not long, however, before the
sea, overwhelming its shores, began to deluge the whole earth, and it
was soon perceived to be augmented by showers from immense clouds. He,
still meditating on the commands of the Lord, saw a vessel advancing,
and entered it with the saints, after having carried into effect the
instructions which had been given him.</p>

<p><i>Vishnu</i> then appeared before them, in the form of a fish, as he had
said, and Satyavrata fastened a cable to his horn.</p>

<p>The deluge in time abated, and Satyavrata, instructed in all divine and
human knowledge, was appointed, by the favor of <i>Vishnu</i>, the Seventh
Menu. After coming forth from the ark he offers up a sacrifice to
Brahma.<a name="FNanchor_25:1_102" id="FNanchor_25:1_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_25:1_102" class="fnanchor">[25:1]</a></p>

<p>The ancient temples of Hindostan contain representations of Vishnu
sustaining the earth while overwhelmed by the waters of the deluge. <i>A
rainbow is seen on the surface of the subsiding waters.</i><a name="FNanchor_25:2_103" id="FNanchor_25:2_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_25:2_103" class="fnanchor">[25:2]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Chinese</i> believe the earth to have been at one time covered with
water, which they described as flowing abundantly and then subsiding.
This great flood divided the higher from the lower age of man. It
happened during the reign of Yaou. This inundation, which is termed
<i>hung-shwuy</i> (great water), almost ruined the country, and is spoken of
by Chinese writers with sentiments of horror. The <i>Shoo-King</i>, one of
their sacred books, describes the waters as reaching to the tops of some
of the mountains, covering the hills, and expanding as wide as the vault
of heaven.<a name="FNanchor_25:3_104" id="FNanchor_25:3_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_25:3_104" class="fnanchor">[25:3]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Parsees</i> say that by the temptation of the evil spirit men became
wicked, and God destroyed them with a deluge, except a few, from whom
the world was peopled anew.<a name="FNanchor_25:4_105" id="FNanchor_25:4_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_25:4_105" class="fnanchor">[25:4]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Zend-Avesta</i>, the oldest sacred book of the Persians, of whom
the Parsees are direct descendants, there are sixteen countries spoken
of as having been given by Ormuzd, the Good Deity, for the Aryans to
live in; and these countries are described as a land of delight, which
was turned by Ahriman, the Evil Deity, into a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>land of death and cold,
partly, it is said, by a great flood, which is described as being like
Noah's flood recorded in the Book of Genesis.<a name="FNanchor_26:1_106" id="FNanchor_26:1_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_26:1_106" class="fnanchor">[26:1]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Greeks</i> had records of a flood which destroyed nearly the
whole human race.<a name="FNanchor_26:2_107" id="FNanchor_26:2_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_26:2_107" class="fnanchor">[26:2]</a> The story is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"From his throne in the high Olympos, Zeus looked down on the
children of men, and saw that everywhere they followed only
their lusts, and cared nothing for right or for law. And ever,
as their hearts waxed grosser in their wickedness, they
devised for themselves new rites to appease the anger of the
gods, till the whole earth was filled with blood. Far away in
the hidden glens of the Arcadian hills the sons of Lykaon
feasted and spake proud words against the majesty of Zeus, and
Zeus himself came down from his throne to see their way and
their doings.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then Zeus returned to his home on Olympos,
and he gave the word that a flood of waters should be let
loose upon the earth, that the sons of men might die for their
great wickedness. So the west wind rose in its might, and the
dark rain-clouds veiled the whole heaven, for the winds of the
north which drive away the mists and vapors were shut up in
their prison house. On hill and valley burst the merciless
rain, and the rivers, loosened from their courses, rushed over
the whole plains and up the mountain-side. From his home on
the highlands of Phthia, Deukalion looked forth on the angry
sky, and, when he saw the waters swelling in the valleys
beneath, he called Pyrrha, his wife, and said to her: 'The
time has come of which my father, the wise Prometheus,
forewarned me. Make ready, therefore, the ark which I have
built, and place in it all that we may need for food while the
flood of waters is out upon the earth.' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then Pyrrha
hastened to make all things ready, and they waited till the
waters rose up to the highlands of Phthia and floated away the
ark of Deukalion. The fishes swam amidst the old elm-groves,
and twined amongst the gnarled boughs on the oaks, while on
the face of the waters were tossed the bodies of men; and
Deukalion looked on the dead faces of stalwart warriors, of
maidens, and of babes, as they rose and fell upon the heavy
waves."</p></div>

<p>When the flood began to abate, the ark rested on Mount Parnassus, and
Deucalion, with his wife Pyrrha, stepped forth upon the desolate earth.
They then immediately constructed an altar, and offered up thanks to
Zeus, the mighty being who sent the flood and saved them from its
waters.<a name="FNanchor_26:3_108" id="FNanchor_26:3_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_26:3_108" class="fnanchor">[26:3]</a></p>

<p>According to Ovid (a Grecian writer born 43 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>), Deucalion does not
venture out of the ark until a dove which he sent out returns to him
with an olive branch.<a name="FNanchor_26:4_109" id="FNanchor_26:4_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_26:4_109" class="fnanchor">[26:4]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p><p>It was at one time extensively believed, even by intelligent scholars,
that the myth of Deucalion was a corrupted tradition of the Noachian
deluge, <i>but this untenable opinion is now all but universally
abandoned</i>.<a name="FNanchor_27:1_110" id="FNanchor_27:1_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_27:1_110" class="fnanchor">[27:1]</a></p>

<p>The legend was found in the West among the Kelts. They believed that a
great deluge overwhelmed the world and drowned all men except Drayan and
Droyvach, who escaped in a boat, and colonized Britain. This boat was
supposed to have been built by the "Heavenly Lord," and it received into
it a pair of every kind of beasts.<a name="FNanchor_27:2_111" id="FNanchor_27:2_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_27:2_111" class="fnanchor">[27:2]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Scandinavians</i> had their legend of a deluge. The <i>Edda</i>
describes this deluge, from which only one man escapes, with his family,
by means of a bark.<a name="FNanchor_27:3_112" id="FNanchor_27:3_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_27:3_112" class="fnanchor">[27:3]</a> It was also found among the ancient Mexicans.
They believed that a man named Coxcox, and his wife, survived the
deluge. Lord Kingsborough, speaking of this legend,<a name="FNanchor_27:4_113" id="FNanchor_27:4_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_27:4_113" class="fnanchor">[27:4]</a> informs us
that the person who answered to Noah entered the ark with six others;
and that the story of sending birds out of the ark, &amp;c., is the same in
general character with that of the Bible.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Dr. Brinton also speaks of the <i>Mexican</i> tradition.<a name="FNanchor_27:5_114" id="FNanchor_27:5_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_27:5_114" class="fnanchor">[27:5]</a> They had not
only the story of sending out the <i>bird</i>, but related that the ark
landed <i>on a mountain</i>. The tradition of a deluge was also found among
the Brazilians, and among many Indian tribes.<a name="FNanchor_27:6_115" id="FNanchor_27:6_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_27:6_115" class="fnanchor">[27:6]</a> The mountain upon
which the ark is supposed to have rested, was pointed to by the
residents in nearly every quarter of the globe. The mountain-chain of
Ararat was considered to be&mdash;by the <i>Chaldeans</i> and <i>Hebrews</i>&mdash;the place
where the ark landed. The <i>Greeks</i> pointed to Mount Parnassus; the
<i>Hindoos</i> to the Himalayas; and in Armenia numberless heights were
pointed out with becoming reverence, as those on which the few survivors
of the dreadful scenes of the deluge were preserved. On the Red River
(in America), near the village of the Caddoes, there was an eminence to
which the Indian tribes for a great distance around paid devout homage.
The Cerro Naztarny on the Rio Grande, the peak of Old Zuni in New
Mexico, that of Colhuacan on the Pacific coast, Mount Apoala in Upper
Mixteca, and Mount Neba in the province of Guaymi, are some of many
elevations asserted by the neighboring <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>nations to have been places of
refuge for their ancestors when the fountains of the great deep broke
forth.</p>

<p>The question now may naturally be asked, How could such a story have
originated unless there was some foundation for it?</p>

<p>In answer to this question we will say that we do not think such a story
could have originated without some foundation for it, and that most, if
not all, legends, have a basis of truth underlying the fabulous,
although not always discernible. This story may have an <i>astronomical</i>
basis, as some suppose,<a name="FNanchor_28:1_116" id="FNanchor_28:1_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_28:1_116" class="fnanchor">[28:1]</a> or it may not. At any rate, it would be
very easy to transmit by memory the fact of the <i>sinking</i> of <i>an
island</i>, or that of <i>an earthquake</i>, or a <i>great flood</i>, caused by
overflows of rivers, &amp;c., which, in the course of time, would be added
to, and enlarged upon, and, in this way, made into quite a lengthy tale.
According to one of the most ancient accounts of the deluge, we are told
that at that time "the forest trees were dashed against each other;"
"the mountains were involved with smoke and flame;" that there was
"fire, and smoke, and wind, which ascended in thick clouds replete with
lightning." "The roaring of the ocean, whilst violently agitated with
the whirling of the mountains, was like the bellowing of a mighty cloud,
&amp;c."<a name="FNanchor_28:2_117" id="FNanchor_28:2_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_28:2_117" class="fnanchor">[28:2]</a></p>

<p>A violent earthquake, with eruptions from volcanic mountains, and the
sinking of land into the sea, would evidently produce such a scene as
this. We know that at one period in the earth's history, such scenes
must have been of frequent occurrence. The science of geology
demonstrates this fact to us. <i>Local deluges</i> were of frequent
occurrence, and that some persons may have been saved on one, or perhaps
many, such occasions, by means of a raft or boat, and that they may have
sought refuge on an eminence, or mountain, does not seem at all
improbable.</p>

<p>During the <i>Champlain</i> period in the history of the world&mdash;which came
after the <i>Glacial</i> period&mdash;the climate became warmer, <i>the continents
sank</i>, and there were, consequently, continued <i>local floods</i> which must
have destroyed considerable animal life, including man. The foundation
of the deluge myth may have been laid at this time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p><p>Some may suppose that this is dating the history of man too far back,
making his history too remote; but such is not the case. There is every
reason to believe that man existed for ages <i>before the Glacial epoch</i>.
It must not be supposed that we have yet found remains of the earliest
human beings; there is evidence, however, that man existed during the
<i>Pliocene</i>, if not during the <i>Miocene</i> periods, when hoofed quadrupeds,
and Proboscidians abounded, human remains and implements having been
found mingled with remains of these animals.<a name="FNanchor_29:1_118" id="FNanchor_29:1_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_29:1_118" class="fnanchor">[29:1]</a></p>

<p>Charles Darwin believed that the animal called man, might have been
properly called by that name at an epoch as remote as the <i>Eocene</i>
period.<a name="FNanchor_29:2_119" id="FNanchor_29:2_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_29:2_119" class="fnanchor">[29:2]</a> Man had probably lost his hairy covering by that time, and
had begun to look human.</p>

<p>Prof. Draper, speaking of the antiquity of man, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"So far as investigations have gone, they <i>indisputably</i> refer
the existence of man to a date remote from us by many
<i>hundreds of thousands of years</i>," and that, "it is difficult
to assign a shorter date from the last glaciation of Europe
than a quarter of a million of years, <i>and human existence
antedates that</i>."<a name="FNanchor_29:3_120" id="FNanchor_29:3_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_29:3_120" class="fnanchor">[29:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Again he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Recent researches give reason to believe that, under low and
base grades, the existence of man can be traced back into the
<i>Tertiary</i> times. He was contemporary with the Southern
Elephant, the Rhinoceros-leptorhinus, the great Hippopotamus,
perhaps even in the <i>Miocene</i>, contemporary with the
Mastodon."<a name="FNanchor_29:4_121" id="FNanchor_29:4_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_29:4_121" class="fnanchor">[29:4]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p><p>Prof. Huxley closes his "Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature," by
saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Where must we look for primeval man? Was the oldest <i>Homo
Sapiens</i> Pliocene or Miocene, <i>or yet more ancient</i>?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If any
form of the doctrine of progressive development is correct,
<i>we must extend by long epochs the most liberal estimate that
has yet been made of the antiquity of man</i>."<a name="FNanchor_30:1_122" id="FNanchor_30:1_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_30:1_122" class="fnanchor">[30:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Prof. Oscar Paschel, in his work on "Mankind," speaking of the deposits
of human remains which have been discovered in caves, mingled with the
bones of wild animals, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The examination of one of these caves at Brixham, by a
geologist as trustworthy as Dr. Falconer, convinced the
specialists of Great Britain, as early as 1858, that man was a
contemporary of the Mammoth, the Woolly Rhinoceros, the
Cave-lion, the Cave-hyena, the Cave-bear, <i>and therefore of
the Mammalia of the Geological period antecedent to our
own</i>."<a name="FNanchor_30:2_123" id="FNanchor_30:2_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_30:2_123" class="fnanchor">[30:2]</a></p></div>

<p>The positive evidence of man's existence during the <i>Tertiary</i> period,
are facts which must firmly convince every one&mdash;who is willing to be
convinced&mdash;of <i>the great antiquity of man</i>. We might multiply our
authorities, but deem it unnecessary.</p>

<p>The observation of shells, corals, and other remains of <i>aquatic
animals</i>, in places above the level of the sea, and even on high
mountains, may have given rise to legends of a great flood.</p>

<p>Fossils found imbedded in high ground have been appealed to, both in
ancient and modern times, both by savage and civilized man, as evidence
in support of their traditions of a flood; and, moreover, the argument,
apparently unconnected with any tradition, is to be found, that because
there are marine fossils in places away from the sea, <i>therefore the sea
must once have been there</i>.</p>

<p>It is only quite recently that the presence of fossil shells, &amp;c., on
high mountains, has been abandoned as evidence of the Noachic flood.</p>

<p>Mr. Tylor tells us that in the ninth edition of "Horne's Introduction to
the Scriptures," published in 1846, the evidence of fossils <i>is
confidently held to prove</i> the universality of the Deluge; <i>but the
argument disappears from the next edition, published ten years
later</i>.<a name="FNanchor_30:3_124" id="FNanchor_30:3_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_30:3_124" class="fnanchor">[30:3]</a></p>

<p>Besides fossil remains of aquatic animals, <i>boats</i> have been found on
tops of mountains.<a name="FNanchor_30:4_125" id="FNanchor_30:4_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_30:4_125" class="fnanchor">[30:4]</a> A discovery of this kind may have given rise to
the story of an <i>ark</i> having been made in which to preserve the favored
ones from the waters, and of its landing on a mountain.<a name="FNanchor_30:5_126" id="FNanchor_30:5_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_30:5_126" class="fnanchor">[30:5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p><p>Before closing this chapter, it may be well to notice a striking
incident in the legend we have been treating, <i>i. e.</i>, the frequent
occurrence of the number <i>seven</i> in the narrative. For instance: the
Lord commands Noah to take into the ark clean beasts by <i>sevens</i>, and
fowls also by <i>sevens</i>, and tells him that in <i>seven</i> days he will cause
it to rain upon the earth. We are also told that the ark rested in the
<i>seventh</i> month, and the <i>seven</i>teenth day of the month, upon the
mountains of Ararat. After sending the dove out of the ark the first
time, Noah waited <i>seven</i> days before sending it out again. After
sending the dove out the second time, "he stayed yet another <i>seven</i>
days" ere he again sent forth the dove.</p>

<p><i>This coincidence arises from the mystic power attached to the number
seven, derived from its frequent occurrence in astrology.</i></p>

<p>We find that in <i>all religions</i> of antiquity the number <i>seven</i>&mdash;which
applied to the <i>sun</i>, <i>moon</i> and the <i>five planets</i> known to the
ancients&mdash;is a <i>sacred number</i>, represented in all kinds and sorts of

a scientific fact that most races of men, in former ages, instead of
being <i>larger</i>, were <i>smaller</i> than at the present time. There is hardly
a suit of armor in the Tower of London, or in the old castles, that is
large enough for the average Englishman of to-day to put on. Man has
grown in stature as well as intellect, and there is no proof
whatever&mdash;in fact, the opposite is certain&mdash;that there ever was a race
of what might properly be called <i>giants</i>, inhabiting the earth. Fossil
remains of large animals having been found by primitive man, <i>and a
legend invented to account for them</i>, it would naturally be that: "There
were giants in the earth in those days." As an illustration we may
mention the story, recorded by the traveller James Orton, we believe (in
"The Andes and the Amazon"), that, near Punin, in South America, was
found the remains of an extinct species of the horse, the mastodon, and
other large animals. This discovery was made, owing to the assurance of
the natives that <i>giants</i> at one time had lived in that country, <i>and
that they had seen their remains at this certain place</i>. Many legends
have had a similar origin. But the originals of all the <i>Ogres</i> and
<i>Giants</i> to be found in the mythology of almost all nations of
antiquity, are the famous Hindoo demons, the <i>Rakshasas</i> of our Aryan
ancestors. The Rakshasas were very terrible creatures indeed, and in the
minds of many people, in India, are so still. Their natural form, so the
stories say, is that of huge, unshapely <i>giants</i>, like <i>clouds</i>, with
hair and beard of the color of the <i>red lightning</i>. This description
explains their origin. <i>They are the dark, wicked and cruel clouds</i>,
personified.</p></div>

the <i>three</i> sons of some king or patriarch. The Germans said that Mannus

ten thousand years before his time." (Bonwick: Egyptian Belief, p. 185.)
Plato lived 429 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> Herodotus relates that the priests of Egypt
informed him that from the first king to the present priest of Vulcan
who last reigned, were three hundred forty and one generations of men,
and during these generations there were the same number of chief priests
and kings. "Now (says he) three hundred generations are equal to ten
thousand years, for three generations of men are one hundred years; and
the forty-one remaining generations that were over the three hundred,
make one thousand three hundred and forty years," making <i>eleven
thousand three hundred and forty years</i>. "Conducting me into the
interior of an edifice that was spacious, and showing me wooden
colossuses to the number I have mentioned, they reckoned them up; for
every high priest places an image of himself there during his life-time;
the priests, therefore, reckoning them and showing them to me, pointed
out that each was the son of his own father; going through them all,
from the image of him who died last until they had pointed them all
out." (Herodotus, book ii. chs. 142, 143.) The discovery of mummies of
royal and priestly personages, made at Deir-el-Bahari (Aug., 1881), near
Thebes, in Egypt, would seem to confirm this statement made by
Herodotus. Of the thirty-nine mummies discovered, one&mdash;that of King
Raskenen&mdash;is about three thousand seven hundred years old. (See a Cairo

of the calendar." (Researches in Ancient Hist., p. 124.) It was on the
same day that Noah is said to have shut himself up in the ark, that the
priests of Egypt shut up in their sacred coffer or ark the image of
Osiris, a personification of the Sun. This was on the 17th of the month
Athor, in which the Sun enters the Scorpion. (See Kenrick's Egypt, vol.
i. p. 410.) The history of Noah also corresponds, in some respects, with
that of Bacchus, another personification of the Sun.</p></div>

For example, Dr. Robinson, in his "Travels in Palestine" (ii. 586),
mentions a tradition that a city had once stood in a desert between
Petra and Hebron, the people of which had perished for their vices, and
been converted into stone. Mr. Seetzen, who went to the spot, found no
traces of ruins, but a number of stony concretions, resembling in form
and size the human head. <i>They had been ignorantly supposed to be
petrified heads, and a legend framed to account for their owners
suffering so terrible a fate.</i> Another illustration is as follows:&mdash;The
Kamchadals believe that volcanic mountains are the abode of devils, who,
after they have cooked their meals, fling the fire-brands out of the
chimney. Being asked what these devils eat, they said "<i>whales</i>." Here
we see, <i>first</i>, a story invented to account for the volcanic eruptions
from the mountains; and, <i>second</i>, a story invented to account for the

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE TOWER OF BABEL.</h3>


<p>We are informed that, at one time, "the whole earth was of one language,
and of one speech. And it came to pass, as they (the inhabitants of the
earth) journeyed from the East, that they found a plain in the land of
Shinar, and they dwelt there.</p>

<p>"And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them
thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.</p>

<p>"And they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and a tower, <i>whose top
may reach unto heaven</i>, and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered
abroad upon the face of the whole earth. <i>And the Lord came down to see
the city and the tower</i>, which the children of men builded. And the Lord
said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and
this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them,
which they have imagined to do. Go to, <i>let us go down</i>, and there
confound their language, that they may not understand one another's
speech. So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
all the earth: and they left off to build the city. Therefore is the
name of it called <i>Babel</i>, because the Lord did there confound the
language of all the earth; and from thence did the Lord scatter them
abroad upon the face of all the earth."<a name="FNanchor_33:1_136" id="FNanchor_33:1_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_33:1_136" class="fnanchor">[33:1]</a></p>

<p>Such is the "Scripture" account of the origin of languages, which
differs somewhat from the ideas of Prof. Max M&uuml;ller and other
philologists.</p>

<p>Bishop Colenso tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The story of the dispensation of tongues is connected by the
Jehovistic writer with the famous unfinished temple of
<i>Belus</i>, of which probably some wonderful reports had reached
him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The derivation of the name <i>Babel</i> from the Hebrew
word <i>babal</i> (confound) which seems to be the connecting point
between the story and the tower of Babel, <i>is altogether
incorrect</i>."<a name="FNanchor_33:2_137" id="FNanchor_33:2_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_33:2_137" class="fnanchor">[33:2]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p><p>The literal meaning of the word being <i>house</i>, or <i>court</i>, or <i>gate</i> of
Bel, or gate of God.<a name="FNanchor_34:1_138" id="FNanchor_34:1_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_34:1_138" class="fnanchor">[34:1]</a></p>

<p>John Fiske confirms this statement by saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The name '<i>Babel</i>' is really '<i>Bab-il</i>', or '<i>The Gate of
God</i>'; but the Hebrew writer <i>erroneously</i> derives the word
from the root '<i>babal</i>'&mdash;to confuse&mdash;and hence arises the
<i>mystical explanation</i>, that Babel was a place where human
speech became confused."<a name="FNanchor_34:2_139" id="FNanchor_34:2_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_34:2_139" class="fnanchor">[34:2]</a></p></div>

<p>The "wonderful reports" that reached the Jehovistic writer who inserted
this tale into the Hebrew Scriptures, were from the Chaldean account of
the confusion of tongues. It is related by <i>Berosus</i> as follows:</p>

<p>The first inhabitants of the earth, glorying in their strength and
size,<a name="FNanchor_34:3_140" id="FNanchor_34:3_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_34:3_140" class="fnanchor">[34:3]</a> and despising the gods, undertook to raise a tower whose top
should reach the sky, in the place where Babylon now stands. But when it
approached the heavens, the winds assisted the gods, and overthrew the
work of the contrivers, and also introduced a diversity of tongues among
men, who till that time had all spoken the same language. The ruins of
this tower are said to be still in Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_34:4_141" id="FNanchor_34:4_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_34:4_141" class="fnanchor">[34:4]</a></p>

<p>Josephus, the Jewish historian, says that it was <i>Nimrod</i> who built the
tower, that he was a very wicked man, and that the tower was built in
case the Lord should have a mind to drown the world again. He continues
his account by saying that when Nimrod proposed the building of this
tower, the multitude were very ready to follow the proposition, as they
could then avenge themselves on God for destroying their forefathers.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And they built a tower, neither sparing any pains nor being
in any degree negligent about the work. And by reason of the
multitude of hands employed on it, it grew very high, sooner
than any one could expect.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was built of burnt brick,
cemented together, with mortar made of bitumen, that it might
not be liable to admit water. When God saw that they had acted
so madly, he did not resolve to destroy them utterly, <i>since
they were not grown wiser by the destruction of the former
sinners</i>, but he caused a tumult among them, by producing in
them divers languages, and causing, that through the multitude
of those languages they should not be able to understand one
another. The place where they built the tower is now called
Babylon."<a name="FNanchor_34:5_142" id="FNanchor_34:5_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_34:5_142" class="fnanchor">[34:5]</a></p></div>

<p>The tower in Babylonia, which seems to have been a foundation for the
legend of the confusion of tongues to be built upon, was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>evidently
originally built for <i>astronomical purposes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_35:1_143" id="FNanchor_35:1_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_35:1_143" class="fnanchor">[35:1]</a> This is clearly seen
from the fact that it was called the "Stages of the Seven
Spheres,"<a name="FNanchor_35:2_144" id="FNanchor_35:2_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_35:2_144" class="fnanchor">[35:2]</a> and that each one of these stages was consecrated to the
Sun, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury.<a name="FNanchor_35:3_145" id="FNanchor_35:3_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_35:3_145" class="fnanchor">[35:3]</a>
Nebuchadnezzar says of it in his <i>cylinders</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The building named the 'Stages of the Seven Spheres,' which
was the tower of Borsippa (Babel), had been built by a former
king. He had completed forty-two cubits, but he did not finish
its head. From the lapse of time, it had become ruined; they
had not taken care of the exits of the waters, so the rain and
wet had penetrated into the brick-work; the casing of burnt
brick had bulged out, and the terraces of crude brick lay
scattered in heaps. Merobach, my great Lord, inclined my heart
to repair the building. I did not change its site, nor did I
destroy its foundation, but, in a fortunate month, and upon an
auspicious day, I undertook the rebuilding of the crude brick
terraces and burnt brick casing, &amp;c., &amp;c."<a name="FNanchor_35:4_146" id="FNanchor_35:4_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_35:4_146" class="fnanchor">[35:4]</a></p></div>

<p>There is not a word said here in these cylinders about the confusion of
tongues, nor anything pertaining to it. The ruins of this ancient tower
being there in Babylonia, and a legend of how the gods confused the
speech of mankind also being among them, it was very convenient to point
to these ruins as evidence that the story was true, just as the ancient
Mexicans pointed to the ruins of the tower of Cholula, as evidence of
the truth of the similar story which they had among them, and just as
many nations pointed to the remains of aquatic animals on the tops of
mountains, as evidence of the truth of the deluge story.</p>

<p>The <i>Armenian</i> tradition of the "Confusion of Tongues" was to this
effect:</p>

<p>The world was formerly inhabited by men "with strong bodies and huge
size" (giants). These men being full of pride and envy, "they formed a
godless resolve to build a high tower; but whilst they were engaged on
the undertaking, a fearful wind overthrew it, which the wrath of God had
sent against it. <i>Unknown words were at the same time blown about among
men</i>, wherefore arose strife and confusion."<a name="FNanchor_35:5_147" id="FNanchor_35:5_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_35:5_147" class="fnanchor">[35:5]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Hindoo</i> legend of the "Confusion of Tongues," is as follows:</p>

<p>There grew in the centre of the earth, the wonderful "<i>World <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>Tree</i>," or
the "<i>Knowledge Tree</i>." It was so tall that it reached almost to heaven.
"It said in its heart: 'I shall hold my head in heaven, and spread my
branches over all the earth, and gather all men together under my
shadow, and protect them, and prevent them from separating.' But Brahma,
to punish the pride of the tree, cut off its branches and cast them down
on the earth, when they sprang up as <i>Wata trees, and made differences
of belief, and speech, and customs</i>, to prevail on the earth, to
disperse men over its surface."<a name="FNanchor_36:1_148" id="FNanchor_36:1_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_36:1_148" class="fnanchor">[36:1]</a></p>

<p>Traces of a somewhat similar story have also been met with among the
<i>Mongolian Tharus</i> in the north of India, and, according to Dr.
Livingston, among the Africans of Lake <i>Nganu</i>.<a name="FNanchor_36:2_149" id="FNanchor_36:2_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_36:2_149" class="fnanchor">[36:2]</a> The ancient
<i>Esthonians</i><a name="FNanchor_36:3_150" id="FNanchor_36:3_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_36:3_150" class="fnanchor">[36:3]</a> had a similar myth which they called "The Cooking of
Languages;" so also had the ancient inhabitants of the continent of
<i>Australia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_36:4_151" id="FNanchor_36:4_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_36:4_151" class="fnanchor">[36:4]</a> The story was found among the ancient Mexicans, and
was related as follows:</p>

<p>Those, with their descendants, who were saved from the deluge which
destroyed all mankind, excepting the few saved in the ark, resolved to
build a tower which would reach to the skies. The object of this was to
see what was going on in Heaven, and also to have a place of refuge in
case of another deluge.<a name="FNanchor_36:5_152" id="FNanchor_36:5_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_36:5_152" class="fnanchor">[36:5]</a></p>

<p>The job was superintended by one of the <i>seven</i> who were saved from the
flood.<a name="FNanchor_36:6_153" id="FNanchor_36:6_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_36:6_153" class="fnanchor">[36:6]</a> He was a <i>giant</i> called Xelhua, surnamed "the
Architect."<a name="FNanchor_36:7_154" id="FNanchor_36:7_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_36:7_154" class="fnanchor">[36:7]</a></p>

<p>Xelhua ordered bricks to be made in the province of Tlamanalco, at the
foot of the Sierra of Cocotl, and to be conveyed to <i>Cholula</i>, where the
tower was to be built. For this purpose, he placed a file of men
reaching from the Sierra to Cholula, who passed the bricks from hand to
hand.<a name="FNanchor_36:8_155" id="FNanchor_36:8_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_36:8_155" class="fnanchor">[36:8]</a> The gods beheld with wrath this edifice,&mdash;the top of which
was nearing the clouds,&mdash;and were much irritated at the daring attempt
of Xelhua. They therefore hurled fire from Heaven upon the pyramid,
which threw it down, and killed many of the workmen. The work was then
discontinued,<a name="FNanchor_36:9_156" id="FNanchor_36:9_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_36:9_156" class="fnanchor">[36:9]</a> as each family interested in the building of the
tower, <i>received a language of their own</i>,<a name="FNanchor_36:10_157" id="FNanchor_36:10_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_36:10_157" class="fnanchor">[36:10]</a> and the builders could
not understand each other.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p><p>Dr. Delitzsch must have been astonished upon coming across this legend;
for he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Actually</i> the Mexicans had a legend of a <i>tower-building</i> as
well as of a <i>flood</i>. Xelhua, one of the <i>seven giants</i>
rescued from the flood, built the great pyramid of Cholula, in
order to reach heaven, until the gods, angry at his audacity,
threw fire upon the building and broke it down, whereupon
every separate family received a language of its own."<a name="FNanchor_37:1_158" id="FNanchor_37:1_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_37:1_158" class="fnanchor">[37:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The ancient Mexicans pointed to the ruins of a tower at Cholula as
evidence of the truth of their story. This tower was seen by Humboldt
and Lord Kingsborough, and described by them.<a name="FNanchor_37:2_159" id="FNanchor_37:2_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_37:2_159" class="fnanchor">[37:2]</a></p>

<p>We may say then, with Dr. Kalisch, that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Most of the ancient nations possessed myths concerning
impious giants who attempted to storm heaven, either to share
it with the immortal gods, or to expel them from it. In some
of these fables <i>the confusion of tongues</i> is represented as
the punishment inflicted by the deities for such
wickedness."<a name="FNanchor_37:3_160" id="FNanchor_37:3_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_37:3_160" class="fnanchor">[37:3]</a></p></div>

<h3>THE TRIAL OF ABRAHAM'S FAITH.</h3>

<p>The story of the trial of Abraham's faith&mdash;when he is ordered by the
Lord to sacrifice his only son Isaac&mdash;is to be found in Genesis xxii.
1-19, and is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And it came to pass .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that God did tempt Abraham, and said
unto him: 'Abraham,' and he said: 'Behold, here I am.' And he
(God) said: 'Take now thy son, thine only son, Isaac, whom
thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer
him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which
I will tell thee of.'</p>

<p>"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his
ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his
son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up
and went into the place which God had told him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (When
Abraham was near the appointed place) he said unto his young
men: 'Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go
yonder and worship, and come again to thee. And Abraham took
the wood for the burnt offering, and laid it upon (the
shoulders of) Isaac his son, and he took the fire in his hand,
and a knife, and they went both of them together. And Isaac
spake unto Abraham his father, and said: 'Behold the fire and
the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?' And
Abraham said: 'My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a
burnt offering.' So they went both of them together, and they
came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built
an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac
his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And Abraham
stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and
said: 'Abraham! Abraham! lay not thine hand upon the lad,
neither do thou anything unto him, for now I know that thou
fearest God, seeing that thou hast not withheld thy son, thine
only son from me.'</p>

<p>"And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns, and Abraham went
and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in
the stead of his son.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And the angel of the Lord called unto
Abraham, out of heaven, the second time, and said: 'By myself
have I <i>sworn</i> saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this
thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
will bless thee, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I will multiply thy seed as the stars
in the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore,
and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. And in thy
seed shall all the nations of the earth be blest, because thou
hast obeyed my voice.' So Abraham returned unto his young men,
and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba, and Abraham
dwelt at Beer-sheba."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p><p>There is a Hindoo story related to the S&acirc;nkh&acirc;yana-s&ucirc;tras, which, in
substance, is as follows: King Hariscandra had no son; he then prayed to
Varuna, promising, that if a son were born to him, he would sacrifice
the child to the god. Then a son was born to him, called Rohita. When
Rohita was grown up his father one day told him of the vow he had made
to Varuna, and bade him prepare to be sacrificed. The son objected to
being killed and ran away from his father's house. For six years he
wandered in the forest, and at last met a starving Brahman. Him he
persuaded to sell one of his sons named Sunahsepha, for a hundred cows.
This boy was bought by Rohita and taken to Hariscandra and about to be
sacrificed to Varuna as a substitute for Rohita, when, on praying to the
gods with verses from the Veda, he was released by them.<a name="FNanchor_39:1_161" id="FNanchor_39:1_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_39:1_161" class="fnanchor">[39:1]</a></p>

<p>There was an ancient <i>Phenician</i> story, written by Sanchoniathon, who
wrote about 1300 years before our era, which is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Saturn, whom the Ph&oelig;nicians call <i>Israel</i>, had by a nymph
of the country a <i>male</i> child whom he named Jeoud, that is,
<i>one and only</i>. On the breaking out of a war, which brought
the country into imminent danger, Saturn erected an altar,
brought to it his son, clothed in royal garments, and
sacrificed him."<a name="FNanchor_39:2_162" id="FNanchor_39:2_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_39:2_162" class="fnanchor">[39:2]</a></p></div>

<p>There is also a <i>Grecian</i> fable to the effect that one Agamemnon had a
daughter whom he dearly loved, and she was deserving of his affection.
He was commanded by God, through the Delphic Oracle, <i>to offer her up as
a sacrifice</i>. Her father long resisted the demand, but finally
succumbed. Before the fatal blow had been struck, however, the goddess
Artemis or Ashtoreth interfered, and carried the maiden away, whilst in
her place was substituted a stag.<a name="FNanchor_39:3_163" id="FNanchor_39:3_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_39:3_163" class="fnanchor">[39:3]</a></p>

<p>Another similar <i>Grecian</i> fable relates that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When the Greek army was detained at Aulis, by contrary winds,
the augurs being consulted, declared that one of the kings had
offended Diana, and she demanded the sacrifice of his daughter
Iphigenia. It was like taking the father's life-blood, but he
was persuaded that it was his duty to submit for the good of
his country. The maiden was brought forth for sacrifice, in
spite of her tears and supplications; but just as the priest
was about to strike the fatal blow, Iphigenia suddenly
disappeared, and a goat of uncommon beauty stood in her
place."<a name="FNanchor_39:4_164" id="FNanchor_39:4_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_39:4_164" class="fnanchor">[39:4]</a></p></div>

<p>There is yet still another, which belongs to the same country, and is
related thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In <i>Sparta</i>, it being declared upon one occasion that the
gods demanded a human victim, the choice was made by lot, and
fell on a damsel named Helena. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>But when all was in readiness,
an eagle descended, carried away the priest's knife, and laid
it on the head of a heifer, which was sacrificed in her
stead."<a name="FNanchor_40:1_165" id="FNanchor_40:1_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_40:1_165" class="fnanchor">[40:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The story of Abraham and Isaac was written at a time when the Mosaic
party in Israel was endeavoring to abolish idolatry among their people.
They were offering up <i>human sacrifices</i> to their gods Moloch, Baal, and
Chemosh, and the priestly author of this story was trying to make the
people think that the Lord had abolished such offerings, as far back as
the time of Abraham. The Grecian legends, which he had evidently heard,
may have given him the idea.<a name="FNanchor_40:2_166" id="FNanchor_40:2_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_40:2_166" class="fnanchor">[40:2]</a></p>

<p>Human offerings to the gods were at one time almost universal. In the
earliest ages the offerings were simple, and such as shepherds and
rustics could present. They loaded the altars of the gods with the first
fruits of their crops, and the choicest products of the earth.
Afterwards they sacrificed animals. When they had once laid it down as a
principle that the effusion of the blood of these animals appeased the
anger of the gods, and that their justice turned aside upon the victims
those strokes which were destined for men, their great care was for
nothing more than to conciliate their favor by so easy a method. It is
the nature of violent desires and excessive fear to know no bounds, and
therefore, when they would ask for any favor which they ardently wished
for, or would deprecate some public calamity which they feared, the
blood of animals was not deemed a price sufficient, but they began to
shed that of men. It is probable, as we have said, that this barbarous
practice was formerly almost universal, and that it is of very remote
antiquity. In time of war the captives were chosen for this purpose, but
in time of peace they took the slaves. The choice was partly regulated
by the opinion of the bystanders, and partly by lot. But they did not
always sacrifice such mean persons. In great calamities, in a pressing
famine, for example, if the people thought they had some pretext to
impute the cause of it to their <i>king</i>, they even sacrificed him without
hesitation, as the <i>highest price</i> with which they could purchase the
Divine favor. In this manner, the first King of Vermaland (a province of
Sweden) was burnt in honor of Odin, the Supreme God, to put an end to a
great dearth; as we read in the history of Norway. The kings, in their
turn, did not spare the blood of their subjects; and many of them even
shed that of their children. Earl Hakon, of Norway, offered his son in
sacrifice, to obtain of Odin the victory over the Jomsburg pirates. Aun,
King of Sweden, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>devoted to Odin the blood of his nine sons, to prevail
on that god to prolong his life. Some of the kings of Israel offered up
their first-born sons as a sacrifice to the god Baal or Moloch.</p>

<p>The altar of Moloch reeked with blood. Children were sacrificed and
burned in the fire to him, while trumpets and flutes drowned their
screams, and the mothers looked on, and were bound to restrain their
tears.</p>

<p>The Phenicians offered to the gods, in times of war and drought, the
fairest of their children. The books of Sanchoniathon and Byblian Philo
are full of accounts of such sacrifices. In Byblos boys were immolated
to Adonis; and, on the founding of a city or colony, a sacrifice of a
vast number of children was solemnized, in the hopes of thereby averting
misfortune from the new settlement. The Phenicians, according to
Eusebius, yearly sacrificed their dearest, and even their only children,
to Saturn. The bones of the victims were preserved in the temple of
Moloch, in a golden ark, which was carried by the Phenicians with them
to war.<a name="FNanchor_41:1_167" id="FNanchor_41:1_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_41:1_167" class="fnanchor">[41:1]</a> Like the Fijians of the present day, those people
considered their gods as beings like themselves. They loved and they
hated; they were proud and revengeful; they were, in fact, savages like
themselves.</p>

<p>If the eldest born of the family of Athamas entered the temple of the
Laphystian Jupiter, at Alos, in Achaia, he was sacrificed, crowned with
garlands, like an animal victim.<a name="FNanchor_41:2_168" id="FNanchor_41:2_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_41:2_168" class="fnanchor">[41:2]</a></p>

<p>The offering of human sacrifices to the Sun was extensively practiced in
Mexico and Peru, before the establishment of Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_41:3_169" id="FNanchor_41:3_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_41:3_169" class="fnanchor">[41:3]</a></p>

<h3>JACOB'S VISION OF THE LADDER.</h3>

<p>In the 28th chapter of Genesis, we are told that Isaac, after blessing
his son Jacob, sent him to Padan-aram, to take a daughter of Laban's
(his mother's brother) to wife. Jacob, obeying his father, "went out
from Beer-sheba (where he dwelt), and went towards Haran. And he lighted
upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was
set. And he took of the stones of the place, and put them for his
pillow, and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed, and behold,
a <i>ladder</i> set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. <i>And
he beheld the angels of God ascending and descending on it.</i> And,
behold, the Lord stood above it, and said: 'I am the Lord God of Abraham
thy father, and the God of Isaac, the land whereon thou liest, to thee
will I give it, and to thy seed.' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And Jacob awoke out of his sleep,
and he said: 'Surely the Lord is in this place, and I know it not.' And
he was afraid, and said: 'How <i>dreadful</i> is this place, <i>this is none
other than the house of God, and this is the gate of Heaven</i>.' And Jacob
rose up early in the morning, <i>and took the stone that he had put for
his pillow, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of
it</i>. And he called the name of that place <i>Beth-el</i>."</p>

<p>The doctrine of Metempsychosis has evidently something to do with this
legend. It means, in the theological acceptation of the term, the
supposed transition of the soul after death, into another substance or
body than that which it occupied before. The belief in such a transition
was common to the most civilized, and the most uncivilized, nations of
the earth.<a name="FNanchor_42:1_170" id="FNanchor_42:1_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_42:1_170" class="fnanchor">[42:1]</a></p>

<p>It was believed in, and taught by, the <i>Brahminical Hindoos</i>,<a name="FNanchor_42:2_171" id="FNanchor_42:2_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_42:2_171" class="fnanchor">[42:2]</a> the

<i>Christian</i> sects.<a href="#Footnote_43:5_178" class="fnanchor">[43:5]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It deserves notice, that in both of these religions (<i>i. e.</i>,
<i>Jewish</i> and <i>Christian</i>), it found adherents as well in
ancient as in modern times. Among the <i>Jews</i>, the doctrine of
transmigration&mdash;the Gilgul Neshamoth&mdash;was taught in the
mystical system of the <i>Kabbala</i>."<a name="FNanchor_43:6_179" id="FNanchor_43:6_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_43:6_179" class="fnanchor">[43:6]</a></p>

<p>"All the souls," the spiritual code of this system says, "are
subject to the trials of transmigration; and men do not know
which are the ways of the Most High in their regard." "The
principle, in short, of the <i>Kabbala</i>, is the same as that of
<i>Brahmanism</i>."</p>

<p>"On the ground of this doctrine, which was shared in by Rabbis
of the highest renown, it was held, for instance, that the
soul of <i>Adam</i> migrated into <i>David</i>, and will come in the
<i>Messiah</i>; that the soul of <i>Japhet</i> is the same as that of
<i>Simeon</i>, and the soul of <i>Terah</i>, migrated into <i>Job</i>."</p>

<p>"Of all these transmigrations, biblical instances are adduced
according to their mode of interpretation&mdash;in the writings of
Rabbi Manasse ben Israel, Rabbi Naphtali, Rabbi Meyer ben
Gabbai, Rabbi Ruben, in the Jalkut Khadash, and other works of
a similar character."<a href="#Footnote_43:4_177" class="fnanchor">[43:4]</a></p></div>

<p>The doctrine is thus described by Ovid, in the language of Dryden:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What feels the body when the soul expires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">By time corrupted, or consumed by fires?<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Nor dies the spirit, but new life repeats<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Into other forms, and only changes seats.<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Ev'n I, who these mysterious truths declare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Was once Euphorbus in the Trojan war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">My name and lineage I remember well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And how in fight by Spartan's King I fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">In Argive Juno's fame I late beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">My buckler hung on high, and own'd my former shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Then death, so called, is but old matter dressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">In some new figure, and a varied vest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Thus all things are but alter'd, nothing dies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And here and there the unbodied spirit flies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Jews undoubtedly learned this doctrine after they had been subdued
by, and become acquainted with other nations; and the writer of this
story, whoever he may have been, was evidently endeavoring to strengthen
the belief in this doctrine&mdash;he being an advocate of it&mdash;by inventing
this story, <i>and making Jacob a witness to the truth of it</i>. Jacob would
have been looked upon at the time the story was written (<i>i. e.</i>, after
the Babylonian captivity), <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>as of great authority. We know that several
writers of portions of the Old Testament have written for similar
purposes. As an illustration, we may mention the book of <i>Esther</i>. This
book was written for the purpose of explaining the origin of the
festival of <i>Purim</i>, and <i>to encourage the Israelites to adopt it</i>. The
writer, <i>who was an advocate of the feast</i>, lived long after the
Babylonish captivity, and is quite unknown.<a name="FNanchor_44:1_180" id="FNanchor_44:1_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_44:1_180" class="fnanchor">[44:1]</a></p>

<p>The writer of the seventeenth chapter of Matthew has made Jesus a
teacher of the doctrine of Transmigration.</p>

<p>The Lord had promised that he would send Elijah (Elias) the prophet,
"before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord,"<a name="FNanchor_44:2_181" id="FNanchor_44:2_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_44:2_181" class="fnanchor">[44:2]</a> and
Jesus is made to say that he had already come, or, <i>that his soul had
transmigrated unto the body of John the Baptist</i>, and they knew it
not.<a name="FNanchor_44:3_182" id="FNanchor_44:3_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_44:3_182" class="fnanchor">[44:3]</a></p>

<p>And in Mark (viii. 27) we are told that Jesus asked his disciples,
saying unto them; "Whom do men say that <i>I</i> am?" whereupon they answer:
"Some say Elias; and others, one of the prophets;" or, in other words,
that the soul of Elias, or one of the prophets, had transmigrated into
the body of Jesus. In John (ix. 1, 2), we are told that Jesus and his
disciples seeing a man "<i>which was blind from his birth</i>," the disciples
asked him, saying; "Master, who did sin, <i>this man</i> (in some former
state) or his parents." Being <i>born</i> blind, how else could he sin,
<i>unless in some former state</i>? These passages result from the fact,
which we have already noticed, that some of the Jewish and Christian
sects believed in the doctrine of Metempsychosis.</p>

<p>According to some Jewish authors, <i>Adam</i> was re-produced in <i>Noah</i>,
<i>Elijah</i>, and other Bible celebrities.<a name="FNanchor_44:4_183" id="FNanchor_44:4_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_44:4_183" class="fnanchor">[44:4]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Faber says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Adam, and Enoch, and Noah, might in outward appearance be
<i>different</i> men, but they were really the <i>self-same</i> divine
persons who had been promised as the seed of the woman,
successively animating various human bodies."<a name="FNanchor_44:5_184" id="FNanchor_44:5_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_44:5_184" class="fnanchor">[44:5]</a></p></div>

<p>We have stated as our belief that the vision which the writer of the
twenty-eighth chapter of Genesis has made Jacob to witness, was intended
to strengthen the belief in the doctrine of the Metempsychosis, that he
was simply seeing the souls of men ascending and descending from heaven
<i>on a ladder</i>, during their transmigrations.</p>

<p>We will now give our reasons for thinking so.</p>

<p>The learned Thomas Maurice tells us that:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p><p>The <i>Indians</i> had, in remote ages, in their system of theology, <i>the
sidereal ladder of seven gates</i>, which described, in a symbolical
manner, the <i>ascending and descending of the souls of men</i>.<a name="FNanchor_45:1_185" id="FNanchor_45:1_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_45:1_185" class="fnanchor">[45:1]</a></p>

<p>We are also informed by Origen that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This descent (<i>i. e.</i>, the descent of souls from heaven to
enter into some body), was described in a symbolical manner,
<i>by a ladder which was represented as reaching from heaven to
earth</i>, and divided into <i>seven</i> stages, at each of which was
figured a gate; the eighth gate was at the top of the ladder,
which belonged to the sphere of the celestial firmament.<a name="FNanchor_45:2_186" id="FNanchor_45:2_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_45:2_186" class="fnanchor">[45:2]</a></p></div>

<p>That souls dwell in the <i>Galaxy</i> was a thought familiar to the
<i>Pythagoreans</i>, who gave it on their master's word, that the souls that
crowd there, <i>descend and appear to men as dreams</i>.<a name="FNanchor_45:3_187" id="FNanchor_45:3_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_45:3_187" class="fnanchor">[45:3]</a></p>

<p>The fancy of the <i>Manicheans</i> also transferred pure souls to this column
of light, <i>whence they could come down to earth and again return</i>.<a name="FNanchor_45:4_188" id="FNanchor_45:4_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_45:4_188" class="fnanchor">[45:4]</a></p>

<p>Paintings representing a scene of this kind may be seen in works of art
illustrative of <i>Indian Mythology</i>.</p>

<p>Maurice speaks of one, in which he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The souls of men are represented as ascending and descending
(on a ladder), according to the received opinion of the
sidereal Metempsychosis in Asia."<a name="FNanchor_45:5_189" id="FNanchor_45:5_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_45:5_189" class="fnanchor">[45:5]</a></p></div>

<p>Mons. Dupuis tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Among the mysterious pictures of the <i>Initiation</i>, in the
cave of the Persian God Mithras, there was exposed to the view
<i>the descent of the souls to the earth, and their return to
heaven</i>, through the seven planetary spheres."<a name="FNanchor_45:6_190" id="FNanchor_45:6_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_45:6_190" class="fnanchor">[45:6]</a></p></div>

<p>And Count de Volney says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the cave of Mithra <i>was a ladder with seven steps</i>,
representing the seven spheres of the planets by means of
which <i>souls ascended and descended</i>. This is precisely the
ladder of Jacob's vision. There is in the Royal Library (of
France) a superb volume of pictures of the Indian gods, in
which the ladder is represented with the souls of men
ascending it."<a name="FNanchor_45:7_191" id="FNanchor_45:7_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_45:7_191" class="fnanchor">[45:7]</a></p></div>

<p>In several of the Egyptian sculptures also, the Transmigration of Souls
is represented by the ascending and descending of souls from heaven to
earth, <i>on a flight of steps</i>, and, as the souls of wicked men were
supposed to enter pigs and other animals, therefore pigs, monkeys, &amp;c.,
are to be seen on the steps, descending from heaven.<a name="FNanchor_45:8_192" id="FNanchor_45:8_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_45:8_192" class="fnanchor">[45:8]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And he dreamed, <i>and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and
the top of it reached to heaven; and behold the angels of God
ascending and descending on it</i>."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p><p>These are the words of the sacred text. Can anything be more
convincing? It continues thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And Jacob awoke out of his sleep .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he was afraid, and
said .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this is none other but the house of God, <i>and this is
the gate of heaven</i>."</p></div>

<p>Here we have "the gate of heaven," mentioned by Origen in describing the
<i>Metempsychosis</i>.</p>

<p>According to the ancients, the <i>top</i> of this ladder was supposed to
reach <i>the throne</i> of <i>the most high God</i>. This corresponds exactly with
the vision of Jacob. The ladder which he is made to see reached unto
heaven, <i>and the Lord stood above it.</i><a name="FNanchor_46:1_193" id="FNanchor_46:1_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_46:1_193" class="fnanchor">[46:1]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the <i>stone</i>
that he had put for his pillow, <i>and set it up for a pillar,
and poured oil upon the top of it</i>."<a name="FNanchor_46:2_194" id="FNanchor_46:2_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_46:2_194" class="fnanchor">[46:2]</a></p></div>

<p>This concluding portion to the story has evidently an allusion to
<i>Phallic</i><a name="FNanchor_46:3_195" id="FNanchor_46:3_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_46:3_195" class="fnanchor">[46:3]</a> worship. There is scarcely a nation of antiquity which
did not set up these stones (as emblems of the reproductive power of
nature) and worship them. Dr. Oort, speaking of this, says:</p>

<p>Few forms of worship were so universal in ancient times as the homage
paid to sacred stones. In the history of the religion of even the most
civilized peoples, such as the Greeks, Romans, Hindoos, Arabs and
Germans, we find traces of this form of worship.<a name="FNanchor_46:4_196" id="FNanchor_46:4_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_46:4_196" class="fnanchor">[46:4]</a> The ancient
<i>Druids</i> of Britain also worshiped sacred stones, which were <i>set up on
end</i>.<a name="FNanchor_46:5_197" id="FNanchor_46:5_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_46:5_197" class="fnanchor">[46:5]</a></p>

<p>Pausanias, an eminent Greek historian, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>Hermiac</i> statue, which they venerate in Cyllen&ecirc; above
other <i>symbols</i>, is an erect <i>Phallus</i> on a pedestal."<a name="FNanchor_46:6_198" id="FNanchor_46:6_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_46:6_198" class="fnanchor">[46:6]</a></p></div>

<p>This was nothing more than a smooth, oblong <i>stone</i>, set erect on a flat
one.<a name="FNanchor_46:7_199" id="FNanchor_46:7_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_46:7_199" class="fnanchor">[46:7]</a></p>

<p>The learned Dr. Ginsburg, in his "Life of Levita," alludes to the
ancient mode of worship offered to the heathen deity Hermes, or Mercury.
A "Hermes" (<i>i. e.</i>, a <i>stone</i>) was frequently set up on the road-side,
and each traveller, as he passed by, paid his homage to the deity by
either throwing a stone on the heap (which was thus collected), or by

reasons for believing that the story of Jacob's <i>setting up</i> a stone,

<p>The male and female powers of nature were denoted respectively by an
upright and an oval emblem, and the conjunction of the two furnished at
once the altar and the <i>Ashera</i>, or grove, against which the Hebrew
prophets lifted up their voices in earnest protest. In the kingdoms,
both of Judah and Israel, the rites connected with these emblems assumed
their most corrupting form. Even in the temple itself, stood the
<i>Ashera</i>, or the upright emblem, on the circular altar of Baal-Peor, the
Priapos of the Jews, thus reproducing the <i>Linga</i>, and <i>Yoni</i> of the
Hindu.<a name="FNanchor_47:5_205" id="FNanchor_47:5_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_47:5_205" class="fnanchor">[47:5]</a> For this symbol, the women wove hangings, as the Athenian
maidens embroidered the sacred peplos for the ship presented to Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc;,
at the great Dionysiac festival. This <i>Ashera</i>, which, in the authorized
English version of the Old Testament is translated "<i>grove</i>," was, in
fact, a pole, or stem of a tree. It is reproduced in our modern
"Maypole," around which maidens dance, as maidens did of yore.<a name="FNanchor_47:6_206" id="FNanchor_47:6_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_47:6_206" class="fnanchor">[47:6]</a></p>

are "<i>Anointed Stones</i>, worshiped among the Greeks, Phrygians, and other
nations of the East;" that "these Baetylia were greatly venerated by the
ancient Heathen, many of their idols being no other;" and that, "in
reality no sort of idol was more common in the East, than that of oblong
stones <i>erected</i>, and hence termed by the Greeks <i>pillars</i>." The Rev.
Geo. W. Cox, in his Aryan Mythology (vol. ii. p. 113), says: "The
erection of these stone columns or pillars, the forms of which in most
cases tell their own story, are common throughout the East, some of the
most elaborate being found near Ghizni." And Mr. Wake (Phallism in
Ancient Religions, p. 60), says: "Kiyun, or Kivan, the name of the deity
said by Amos (v. 26), to have been worshiped in the wilderness by the
Hebrews, signifies <span class="smcap">God of the pillar</span>."</p></div>

worship of the male and female generative organs among the ancients,
when the subject is properly understood. Being the most intimately
connected with the reproduction of life on earth, the <i>Linga</i> became the
symbol under which the <i>Sun</i>, invoked with a thousand names, has been
worshiped throughout the world <i>as the restorer of the powers of nature</i>
after the long sleep or death of winter. But if the <i>Linga</i> is the
Sun-god in his majesty, the <i>Yoni</i> is the earth who yields her fruit
under his fertilizing warmth.
</p><p>
The <i>Phallic tree</i> is introduced into the narrative of the book of
Genesis: but it is here called a tree, not of life, but of the knowledge
of good and evil, that knowledge which dawns in the mind with the first
consciousness of difference between man and woman. In contrast with this
tree of carnal indulgence, tending to death, is the tree of life,
denoting the higher existence for which man was designed, and which
would bring with it the happiness and the freedom of the children of
God. In the brazen serpent of the Pentateuch, the two emblems of the
<i>cross</i> and <i>serpent</i>, the quiescent and energising Phallos, are united.

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE EXODUS FROM EGYPT, AND PASSAGE THROUGH THE RED SEA.</h3>

<p>The children of Israel, who were in bondage in Egypt, making bricks, and
working in the field,<a name="FNanchor_48:1_207" id="FNanchor_48:1_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_48:1_207" class="fnanchor">[48:1]</a> were looked upon with compassion by the
Lord.<a name="FNanchor_48:2_208" id="FNanchor_48:2_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_48:2_208" class="fnanchor">[48:2]</a> He heard their groaning, and remembered his covenant with
Abraham,<a name="FNanchor_48:3_209" id="FNanchor_48:3_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_48:3_209" class="fnanchor">[48:3]</a> with Isaac, and with Jacob. He, therefore, chose Moses
(an Israelite, who had murdered an Egyptian,<a name="FNanchor_48:4_210" id="FNanchor_48:4_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_48:4_210" class="fnanchor">[48:4]</a> and who, therefore,
was obliged to flee from Egypt, as Pharaoh sought to punish him), as his
servant, to carry out his plans.</p>

<p>Moses was at this time keeping the flock of Jeruth, his father-in-law,
in the land of Midian. The angel of the Lord, or the Lord himself,
appeared to him there, and said unto him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am the God of thy Father, the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have seen the affliction of
<i>my people</i> which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by
reason of their tormentors; for I know their sorrows. And I am
<i>come down</i> to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians,
and to bring them up out of that land into a good land and a
large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. I will send
thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people, the
children of Israel, out of Egypt."</p></div>

<p>Then Moses said unto the Lord:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall
say unto them, the God of your fathers hath sent me unto you,
and they shall say unto me: What is his name? What shall I say
unto them?"</p></div>

<p>Then God said unto Moses:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">I am that I am.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_48:5_211" id="FNanchor_48:5_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_48:5_211" class="fnanchor">[48:5]</a> "Thus shalt thou say unto the children
of Israel, <span class="smcap">I am</span> hath sent me unto you."<a name="FNanchor_48:6_212" id="FNanchor_48:6_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_48:6_212" class="fnanchor">[48:6]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p><p>And God said, moreover, unto Moses:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Go and gather the Elders of Israel together, and say unto
them: the Lord God of your fathers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. appeared unto me,
saying: 'I have surely visited you, and seen that which is
done to you in Egypt. And I have said, I will bring you up out
of the affliction of Egypt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unto a land flowing with milk
and honey.' And they shall hearken to thy voice, and thou
shall come, thou and the Elders of Israel, unto the king of
Egypt, and ye shall say unto him: 'the Lord God of the Hebrews
hath met with us, and now let us go, we beseech thee, <i>three
days journey in the wilderness</i>, that we may sacrifice to the
Lord our God.'<a name="FNanchor_49:1_213" id="FNanchor_49:1_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_49:1_213" class="fnanchor">[49:1]</a></p>

<p>"<i>I am sure</i> that the king of Egypt will <i>not</i> let you go, no,
not by a mighty hand. And I will stretch out my hand, and
smite Egypt with all my wonders, which I will do in the midst
thereof: <i>and after that he will let you go</i>. And I will give
this people (the Hebrews) favor in the sight of the Egyptians,
and it shall come to pass, that when ye go, <i>ye shall not go
empty</i>. But every woman shall <i>borrow</i> of her neighbor, and of
her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver and jewels
of gold, and raiment. And ye shall put them upon your sons and
upon your daughters, <i>and ye shall spoil the
Egyptians</i>."<a name="FNanchor_49:2_214" id="FNanchor_49:2_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_49:2_214" class="fnanchor">[49:2]</a></p></div>

<p>The Lord again appeared unto Moses, in Midian, and said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Go, return into Egypt, for all the men are dead which sought
thy life. And Moses took his wife, and his son, and set them
upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses
took the <i>rod of God</i> (which the Lord had given him) in his
hand."<a name="FNanchor_49:3_215" id="FNanchor_49:3_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_49:3_215" class="fnanchor">[49:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Upon arriving in Egypt, Moses tells his brother Aaron, "all the words of
the Lord," and Aaron tells all the children of Israel. Moses, who was
not eloquent, but had a slow speech,<a name="FNanchor_49:4_216" id="FNanchor_49:4_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_49:4_216" class="fnanchor">[49:4]</a> uses Aaron as his
spokesman.<a name="FNanchor_49:5_217" id="FNanchor_49:5_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_49:5_217" class="fnanchor">[49:5]</a> They then appear unto Pharaoh, and falsify, "<i>according
to the commands of the Lord</i>," saying: "Let us go, we pray thee, <i>three
days' journey in the desert</i>, and sacrifice unto the Lord our
God."<a name="FNanchor_49:6_218" id="FNanchor_49:6_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_49:6_218" class="fnanchor">[49:6]</a></p>

<p>The Lord hardens Pharaoh's heart, so that he does not let the children
of Israel go to sacrifice unto their God, in the desert.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p><p>Moses and Aaron continue interceding with him, however, and, for the
purpose of showing their miraculous powers, they change their rods into
serpents, the river into blood, cause a plague of frogs and lice, and a
swarm of flies, &amp;c., &amp;c., to appear. Most of these feats were imitated
by the magicians of Egypt. Finally, the first-born of Egypt are slain,
when Pharaoh, after having had his heart hardened, by the Lord, over and
over again, consents to let Moses and the children of Israel go to serve
their God, <i>as they had said</i>, that is, for <i>three</i> days.</p>

<p>The Lord having given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians,
they borrowed of them jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and raiment,
"<i>according to the commands of the Lord</i>." And they journeyed toward
Succoth, there being <i>six hundred thousand, besides children</i>.<a name="FNanchor_50:1_219" id="FNanchor_50:1_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_50:1_219" class="fnanchor">[50:1]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in
Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. And the Lord went before
them by day, <i>in a pillar of a cloud</i>, to lead them the way;
and by night <i>in a pillar of fire</i>, to give them light to go
by day and night."<a name="FNanchor_50:2_220" id="FNanchor_50:2_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_50:2_220" class="fnanchor">[50:2]</a></p>

<p>"And it was told the king of Egypt, that the people fled.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him.
And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots
of Egypt, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he pursued after the children of Israel, and
overtook them encamping beside the sea.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And when Pharaoh
drew nigh, the children of Israel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were sore afraid, and
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (they) cried out unto the Lord.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And the Lord said unto
Moses, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. speak unto the children of Israel, that they go
forward. But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand
over the Red Sea, and divide it, and the children of Israel
shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,<a name="FNanchor_50:3_221" id="FNanchor_50:3_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_50:3_221" class="fnanchor">[50:3]</a> and the Lord
caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind that night,
and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. And
the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the
dry ground; <i>and the waters were a wall unto them upon the
right hand, and on their left</i>. And the Egyptians pursued, and
went in after them to the midst of the sea, <i>even all
Pharaoh's horses, and his chariots, and his horse-men</i>."</p></div>

<p>After the children of Israel had landed on the other side of the sea,
the Lord said unto Moses:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come
again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their
horse-men. And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea,
and the sea returned to his strength.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And the Lord
overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. And the
waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horse-men,
and all the host of Pharaoh <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>that came into the sea after
them; there remained not so much as one of them. But the
children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the
sea, and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand,
and on their left.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And Israel saw the great work which the
Lord did upon the Egyptians, and the people feared the Lord,
and believed the Lord and his servant Moses."<a name="FNanchor_51:1_222" id="FNanchor_51:1_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_51:1_222" class="fnanchor">[51:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The writer of this story, whoever he may have been, was evidently
familiar with the legends related of the Sun-god, <i>Bacchus</i>, as he has
given Moses the credit of performing some of the miracles which were
attributed to that god.</p>

<p>It is related in the hymns of Orpheus,<a name="FNanchor_51:2_223" id="FNanchor_51:2_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_51:2_223" class="fnanchor">[51:2]</a> that Bacchus had a <i>rod</i>
with which he performed miracles, and which he could change into a
<i>serpent</i> at pleasure. <i>He passed the Red Sea, dry shod, at the head of
his army.</i> He divided the waters of the rivers Orontes and Hydaspus, by
the touch of his rod, and passed through them dry-shod.<a name="FNanchor_51:3_224" id="FNanchor_51:3_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_51:3_224" class="fnanchor">[51:3]</a> <i>By the
same mighty wand, he drew water from the rock</i>,<a name="FNanchor_51:4_225" id="FNanchor_51:4_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_51:4_225" class="fnanchor">[51:4]</a> and wherever they
marched, the land flowed with wine, milk and honey.<a name="FNanchor_51:5_226" id="FNanchor_51:5_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_51:5_226" class="fnanchor">[51:5]</a></p>

<p>Professor Steinthal, speaking of Dionysus (Bacchus), says:</p>

<p>Like Moses, he strikes fountains of wine and water out of the rock.
Almost all the acts of Moses correspond to those of the Sun-gods.<a name="FNanchor_51:6_227" id="FNanchor_51:6_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_51:6_227" class="fnanchor">[51:6]</a></p>

<p>Mons. Dupuis says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Among the different miracles of Bacchus and his Bacchantes,
there are prodigies very similar to those which are attributed
to Moses; for instance, such as the sources of water which the
<i>former</i> caused to sprout from the innermost of the
rocks."<a name="FNanchor_51:7_228" id="FNanchor_51:7_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_51:7_228" class="fnanchor">[51:7]</a></p></div>

<p>In Bell's Pantheon of the Gods and Heroes of Antiquity,<a name="FNanchor_51:8_229" id="FNanchor_51:8_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_51:8_229" class="fnanchor">[51:8]</a> an account
of the prodigies attributed to Bacchus is given; among these, are
mentioned his striking water from the rock, with his magic wand, his
turning a twig of ivy into a snake, his passing through the Red Sea and
the rivers Orontes and Hydaspus, and of his enjoying the light of the
Sun (while marching with his army in India), when the day was spent, and
it was dark to others. All these are parallels too striking to be
accidental.</p>

<p>We might also mention the fact, that Bacchus, as well as Moses <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>was
called the "<i>Law-giver</i>," and that it was said of Bacchus, as well as of
Moses, that his laws were written on <i>two tables of stone</i>.<a name="FNanchor_52:1_230" id="FNanchor_52:1_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:1_230" class="fnanchor">[52:1]</a>
Bacchus was represented <i>horned</i>, and so was Moses.<a name="FNanchor_52:2_231" id="FNanchor_52:2_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:2_231" class="fnanchor">[52:2]</a> Bacchus "was
picked up in a box, that floated on the water,"<a name="FNanchor_52:3_232" id="FNanchor_52:3_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:3_232" class="fnanchor">[52:3]</a> and so was
Moses.<a name="FNanchor_52:4_233" id="FNanchor_52:4_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:4_233" class="fnanchor">[52:4]</a> Bacchus had two mothers, one by nature, and one by
adoption,<a name="FNanchor_52:5_234" id="FNanchor_52:5_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:5_234" class="fnanchor">[52:5]</a> and so had Moses.<a name="FNanchor_52:6_235" id="FNanchor_52:6_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:6_235" class="fnanchor">[52:6]</a> And, as we have already seen,
Bacchus and his army enjoyed the light of the Sun, during the night
time, and Moses and his army enjoyed the light of "a pillar of fire, by
night."<a name="FNanchor_52:7_236" id="FNanchor_52:7_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:7_236" class="fnanchor">[52:7]</a></p>

<p>In regard to the children of Israel going out from the land of Egypt, we
have no doubt that such an occurrence took place, although not in the
manner, and not for such reasons, as is recorded by the <i>sacred
historian</i>. We find, from other sources, what is evidently nearer the
truth.</p>

<p>It is related by the historian Choeremon, that, at one time, the land of
Egypt was infested with disease, and through the advice of the sacred
scribe Phritiphantes, the king caused the infected people (who were none
other than the brick-making slaves, known as the children of Israel), to
be collected, <i>and driven out of the country</i>.<a name="FNanchor_52:8_237" id="FNanchor_52:8_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:8_237" class="fnanchor">[52:8]</a></p>

<p><i>Lysimachus</i> relates that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A filthy disease broke out in Egypt, and the Oracle of Ammon,
being consulted on the occasion, commanded the king to purify
the land <i>by driving out the Jews</i> (who were infected with
leprosy, &amp;c.), a race of men who were hateful to the
Gods."<a name="FNanchor_52:9_238" id="FNanchor_52:9_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:9_238" class="fnanchor">[52:9]</a> <ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins><i>The whole multitude of the people were
accordingly collected and driven out into the
wilderness.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_52:10_239" id="FNanchor_52:10_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:10_239" class="fnanchor">[52:10]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, referring to this event, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In ancient times Egypt was afflicted with a great plague,
which was attributed to the anger of God, on account of the
multitude of foreigners in Egypt: by whom the rites of the
native religion were neglected. <i>The Egyptians accordingly
drove them out.</i> The most noble of them went under Cadmus and
Danaus to Greece, but the greater number followed <i>Moses</i>, a
wise and valiant leader, to Palestine."<a name="FNanchor_52:11_240" id="FNanchor_52:11_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:11_240" class="fnanchor">[52:11]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p><p>After giving the different opinions concerning the origin of the Jewish
nation, Tacitus, the Roman historian, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In this clash of opinions, <i>one point seems to be universally
admitted</i>. A pestilential disease, disfiguring the race of
man, and making the body an object of loathsome deformity,
spread all over Egypt. Bocchoris, at that time the reigning
monarch, consulted the oracle of Jupiter Hammon, and received
for answer, that the kingdom must be purified, by
exterminating the infected multitude, as a race of men
detested by the gods. After diligent search, the wretched
sufferers were collected together, and in a wild and barren
desert abandoned to their misery. In that distress, while the
vulgar herd was sunk in deep despair, Moses, one of their
number, reminded them, that, by the wisdom of his councils,
they had been already rescued out of impending danger.
Deserted as they were by men and gods, he told them, that if
they did not repose their confidence in him, as their chief by
divine commission, they had no resource left. His offer was
accepted. Their march began, they knew not whither. Want of
water was their chief distress. Worn out with fatigue, they
lay stretched on the bare earth, heart broken, ready to
expire, when a troop of wild asses, returning from pasture,
went up the steep ascent of a rock covered with a grove of
trees. The verdure of the herbage round the place suggested
the idea of springs near at hand. Moses traced the steps of
the animals, and discovered a plentiful vein of water. By this
relief the fainting multitude was raised from despair. They
pursued their journey for six days without intermission. On
the seventh day they made halt, and, having expelled the
natives, took possession of the country, where they built
their city, and dedicated their temple."<a name="FNanchor_53:1_241" id="FNanchor_53:1_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_53:1_241" class="fnanchor">[53:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Other accounts, similar to these, might be added, among which may be
mentioned that given by Manetho, an Egyptian priest, which is referred
to by Josephus, the Jewish historian.</p>

<p>Although the accounts quoted above are not exactly alike, <i>yet the main
points are the same</i>, which are to the effect that Egypt was infected
with disease owing to the foreigners (among whom were those who were
afterwards styled "the children of Israel") that were in the country,
and who were an unclean people, and that they were accordingly driven
out into the wilderness.</p>

<p>When we compare this statement with that recorded in Genesis, it does
not take long to decide which of the two is nearest the truth.</p>

<p>Everything putrid, or that had a tendency to putridity, was carefully
avoided by the ancient Egyptians, and so strict were the Egyptian
priests on this point, that they wore no garments made of any animal
substance, circumcised themselves, and shaved their whole bodies, even
to their eyebrows, lest they should unknowingly harbor any filth,
excrement or vermin, supposed to be bred from putrefaction.<a name="FNanchor_53:2_242" id="FNanchor_53:2_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_53:2_242" class="fnanchor">[53:2]</a> We
know from the laws set down in <i>Leviticus</i>, that the Hebrews were not a
remarkably clean race.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p><p>Jewish priests, <i>in making a history for their race</i>, have given us but
a shadow of truth here and there; it is almost wholly mythical. The
author of "The Religion of Israel," speaking on this subject, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The history of the religion of Israel <i>must start from the
sojourn</i> of <i>the Israelites in Egypt</i>. Formerly it was usual
to take a much earlier starting-point, and to begin with a
religious discussion of the religious ideas of the
<i>Patriarchs</i>. And this was perfectly right, so long as the
accounts of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were considered
<i>historical</i>. <i>But now that a strict investigation has shown
us that all these stories are entirely unhistorical</i>, of
course we have to begin the history later on."<a name="FNanchor_54:1_243" id="FNanchor_54:1_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_54:1_243" class="fnanchor">[54:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The author of "The Spirit History of Man," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Hebrews came out of Egypt and settled among the
Canaanites. <i>They need not be traced beyond the Exodus. That
is their historical beginning.</i> It was very easy to cover up
this remote event by the recital of mythical traditions, and
to prefix to it an account of their origin in which the gods
(Patriarchs), should figure as their ancestors."<a name="FNanchor_54:2_244" id="FNanchor_54:2_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_54:2_244" class="fnanchor">[54:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Professor Goldzhier says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The residence of the Hebrews in Egypt, and their exodus
thence under the guidance and training of an enthusiast for
the freedom of his tribe, form a series of strictly historical
facts, which find confirmation even in the documents of
ancient Egypt (which we have just shown). But the traditional
narratives of these events (were) <i>elaborated by the Hebrew
people</i>."<a name="FNanchor_54:3_245" id="FNanchor_54:3_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_54:3_245" class="fnanchor">[54:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Count de Volney also observes that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"What Exodus says of their (the Israelites) servitude under
the king of Heliopolis, and of the oppression of their hosts,
the Egyptians, is extremely probable. <i>It is here their
history begins. All that precedes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is nothing but mythology
and cosmogony.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_54:4_246" id="FNanchor_54:4_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_54:4_246" class="fnanchor">[54:4]</a></p></div>

<p>In speaking of the sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt, Dr. Knappert
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"According to the tradition preserved in Genesis, it was the
promotion of Jacob's son, Joseph, to be viceroy of Egypt, that
brought about the migration of the sons of Israel from Canaan
to Goshen. The story goes that this Joseph was sold as a slave
by his brothers, and after many changes of fortune received
the vice-regal office at Pharaoh's hands through his skill in
interpreting dreams. Famine drives his brothers&mdash;and
afterwards his father&mdash;to him, and the Egyptian prince gives
them the land of Goshen to live in. <i>It is by imagining all
this that the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>legend tries to account for the fact that
Israel passed some time in Egypt.</i> But we must look for the
real explanation in a migration of certain tribes which could
not establish or maintain themselves in Canaan, and were
forced to move further on.</p>

<p>"We find a passage in Flavius Josephus, from which it appears
that in Egypt, too, a recollection survived of the sojourn of
some foreign tribes in the north-eastern district of the
country. For this writer gives us two fragments out of a lost
work by Manetho, a priest, who lived about 250 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> In one of
these we have a statement that pretty nearly agrees with the
Israelitish tradition about a sojourn in Goshen. <i>But the
Israelites were looked down on by the Egyptians as foreigners,
and they are represented as lepers and unclean.</i> Moses himself
is mentioned by name, and we are told that he was a priest and
joined himself to these <i>lepers</i> and gave them laws."<a name="FNanchor_55:1_247" id="FNanchor_55:1_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_55:1_247" class="fnanchor">[55:1]</a></p></div>

<p>To return now to the story of the Red Sea being divided to let Moses and
his followers pass through&mdash;of which we have already seen one
counterpart in the legend related of Bacchus and his army passing
through the same sea dry-shod&mdash;there is another similar story concerning
Alexander the Great.</p>

<p>The histories of Alexander relate that the Pamphylian Sea was divided to
let him and his army pass through. Josephus, after speaking of the Red
Sea being divided for the passage of the Israelites, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"For the sake of those who accompanied Alexander, king of
Macedonia, who yet lived comparatively but a little while ago,
the Pamphylian Sea retired and offered them a passage through
itself, when they had no other way to go .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>and this is
confessed to be true by all who have written about the actions
of Alexander</i>."<a name="FNanchor_55:2_248" id="FNanchor_55:2_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_55:2_248" class="fnanchor">[55:2]</a></p></div>

<p>He seems to consider both legends of the same authority, quoting the
latter to substantiate the former.</p>

<p>"Callisthenes, who himself accompanied Alexander in the expedition,"
"wrote, how the Pamphylian Sea did not only open a passage for
Alexander, but, rising and elevating its waters, did pay him homage as
its king."<a name="FNanchor_55:3_249" id="FNanchor_55:3_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_55:3_249" class="fnanchor">[55:3]</a></p>

<p>It is related in Egyptian mythology that Isis was at one time on a
journey with the eldest child of the king of Byblos, when coming to the
river Ph&oelig;drus, which was in a "rough air," and wishing to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>cross, she
commanded the stream to be <i>dried up</i>. This being done she crossed
without trouble.<a name="FNanchor_56:1_250" id="FNanchor_56:1_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_56:1_250" class="fnanchor">[56:1]</a></p>

<p>There is a <i>Hindoo</i> fable to the effect that when the infant Crishna was
being sought by the reigning tyrant of Madura (King Kansa)<a name="FNanchor_56:2_251" id="FNanchor_56:2_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_56:2_251" class="fnanchor">[56:2]</a> his
foster-father took him and departed out of the country. Coming to the
river Yumna, and wishing to cross, it was divided for them by the Lord,
and they passed through.</p>

<p>The story is related by Thomas Maurice, in his "History of Hindostan,"
who has taken it from the <i>Bhagavat Pooraun</i>. It is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Yasodha took the child Crishna, and carried him off (from
where he was born), but, coming to the river Yumna, directly
opposite to Gokul, Crishna's father perceiving the current to
be very strong, it being in the midst of the rainy season, and
not knowing which way to pass it, Crishna commanded the water
to give way on both sides to his father, <i>who accordingly
passed dry-footed, across the river</i>."<a name="FNanchor_56:3_252" id="FNanchor_56:3_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_56:3_252" class="fnanchor">[56:3]</a></p></div>

<p>This incident is illustrated in Plate 58 of Moore's "Hindu Pantheon."</p>

<p>There is another Hindoo legend, recorded in the <i>Rig Veda</i>, and quoted
by Viscount Amberly, from whose work we take it,<a name="FNanchor_56:4_253" id="FNanchor_56:4_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_56:4_253" class="fnanchor">[56:4]</a> to the effect
that an Indian sage called Visvimati, having arrived at a river which he
wished to cross, that holy man said to it: "Listen to the Bard who has
come to you from afar with wagon and chariot. Sink down, become
fordable, and reach not up to our chariot axles." The river answers: "I
will bow down to thee like a woman with full breast (suckling her
child), as a maid to a man, will I throw myself open to thee."</p>

<p>This is accordingly done, and the sage passes through.</p>

<p>We have also an Indian legend which relates that a courtesan named
Bindumati, <i>turned back the streams of the river Ganges</i>.<a name="FNanchor_56:5_254" id="FNanchor_56:5_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_56:5_254" class="fnanchor">[56:5]</a></p>

<p>We see then, that the idea of seas and rivers being divided for the
purpose of letting some chosen one of God pass through is an old one
peculiar to other peoples beside the Hebrews, and the probability is
that many nations had legends of this kind.</p>

<p>That Pharaoh and his host should have been drowned in the Red Sea, and
the fact not mentioned by any historian, is simply impossible,
especially when they have, as we have seen, noticed the fact of the
Israelites being driven out of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_56:6_255" id="FNanchor_56:6_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_56:6_255" class="fnanchor">[56:6]</a> Dr. Inman, speaking of this,
says:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"We seek in vain amongst the Egyptian hieroglyphs for scenes
which recall such cruelties as those we read of in the Hebrew
records; and in the writings which have hitherto been
translated, we find nothing resembling the wholesale
destructions described and applauded by the Jewish historians,
as perpetrated by their own people."<a name="FNanchor_57:1_256" id="FNanchor_57:1_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_57:1_256" class="fnanchor">[57:1]</a></p></div>

<p>That Pharaoh should have pursued a tribe of diseased slaves, <i>whom he
had driven out of his country</i>, is altogether improbable. In the words
of Dr. Knappert, we may conclude, by saying that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>This story, which was not written until more than five
hundred years after the exodus itself, can lay no claim to be
considered historical</i>."<a name="FNanchor_57:2_257" id="FNanchor_57:2_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_57:2_257" class="fnanchor">[57:2]</a></p></div>

temple in Egypt. (Higgins' Anacalypsis, vol. ii. p. 17.) "'<span class="smcap">I am</span>' was a
Divine name understood by all the initiated among the Egyptians." "The
'<span class="smcap">I am</span>' of the Hebrews, and the '<span class="smcap">I am</span>' of the Egyptians are identical."
(Bunsen: Keys of St. Peter, p. 38.) The name "<i>Jehovah</i>," which was
adopted by the Hebrews, was a name esteemed sacred among the Egyptians.
They called it <span class="smcap">Y-ha-ho</span>, or <span class="smcap">Y-ah-weh</span>. (See the Religion of Israel, pp.
42, 43; and Anacalypsis, vol. i. p. 329, and vol. ii. p. 17.) "None dare

"That this divine name was well-known to the <i>Heathen</i> there can be no
doubt." (Parkhurst: Hebrew Lex. in Anac., i. 327.) So also with the name
<i>El Shaddai</i>. "The extremely common Egyptian expression <i>Nutar Nutra</i>
exactly corresponds in sense to the Hebrew <i>El Shaddai</i>, the very title
by which God tells Moses he was known to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob."

tells us that, 'though there are no tides in this part of the
Mediterranean, considerable depression of the sea is caused by
long-continued north winds; and Alexander, taking advantage of such a
moment, may have dashed on without impediment;' and we accept the
explanation as a matter of course. But the waters of the Red Sea are
said to have miraculously opened a passage for the children of Israel;

<h3>RECEIVING THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.</h3>

<p>The receiving of the <i>Ten Commandments</i> by Moses, from the Lord, is
recorded in the following manner:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone
forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into
the wilderness of Sinai, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there Israel camped before
the Mount.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"And it came to pass on the third day that there were thunders
and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the Mount, and the
voice of the tempest exceedingly loud, so that all the people
that was in the camp trembled.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord
descended upon it in fire, and the smoke thereof ascended as
the smoke of a furnace, and the whole Mount quaked greatly.
And when the voice of the tempest sounded long, and waxed
louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a
voice.</p>

<p>"<i>And the Lord came down upon the Mount</i>, and called Moses up
to the top of the Mount, and Moses went up."<a name="FNanchor_58:1_258" id="FNanchor_58:1_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_58:1_258" class="fnanchor">[58:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The Lord there communed with him, and "he gave unto Moses .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two tables
of testimony, tables of stone, <i>written with the finger of God</i>."<a name="FNanchor_58:2_259" id="FNanchor_58:2_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_58:2_259" class="fnanchor">[58:2]</a></p>

<p>When Moses came down from off the Mount, he found the children of Israel
dancing around a golden calf, which his brother Aaron had made, and, as
his "anger waxed hot," he cast the tables of stone on the ground, and
broke them.<a name="FNanchor_58:3_260" id="FNanchor_58:3_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_58:3_260" class="fnanchor">[58:3]</a> Moses again saw the Lord on the Mount, however, and
received two more tables of stone.<a name="FNanchor_58:4_261" id="FNanchor_58:4_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_58:4_261" class="fnanchor">[58:4]</a> When he came down this time
from off Mount Sinai, "the skin of his face did shine."<a name="FNanchor_58:5_262" id="FNanchor_58:5_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_58:5_262" class="fnanchor">[58:5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p><p>These two tables of stone contained the <i>Ten Commandments</i>,<a name="FNanchor_59:1_263" id="FNanchor_59:1_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_59:1_263" class="fnanchor">[59:1]</a> so it
is said, which the Jews and Christians of the present day are supposed

<p>We have already seen, in the last chapter, that Bacchus was called the
"<i>Law-giver</i>," and that his laws were written on <i>two tables of
stone</i>.<a name="FNanchor_59:3_265" id="FNanchor_59:3_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_59:3_265" class="fnanchor">[59:3]</a> This feature in the Hebrew legend was evidently copied
from that related of Bacchus, but, the idea of his (Moses) receiving the
commandments from the Lord on a <i>mountain</i> was obviously taken from the
<i>Persian</i> legend related of Zoroaster.</p>

<p>Prof. Max M&uuml;ller says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"What applies to the religion of Moses applies to that of
Zoroaster. It is placed before us as a complete system from
the first, <i>revealed by Ahuramazda</i> (Ormuzd), <i>proclaimed by
Zoroaster</i>."<a name="FNanchor_59:4_266" id="FNanchor_59:4_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_59:4_266" class="fnanchor">[59:4]</a></p></div>

<p>The disciples of Zoroaster, in their profusion of legends of the master,
relate that one day, as he prayed <i>on a high mountain</i>, in the midst of
thunders and lightnings ("fire from heaven"), the Lord himself appeared
before him, and delivered unto him the "Book of the Law." While the King
of Persia and the people were assembled together, Zoroaster came down
from the mountain unharmed, bringing with him the "Book of the Law,"
which had been revealed to him by Ormuzd. They call this book the
<i>Zend-Avesta</i>, which signifies the <i>Living Word</i>.<a name="FNanchor_59:5_267" id="FNanchor_59:5_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_59:5_267" class="fnanchor">[59:5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p><p>According to the religion of the Cretans, Minos, their law-giver,
ascended a <i>mountain</i> (Mount Dicta) and there received from the Supreme
Lord (Zeus) the sacred laws which he brought down with him.<a name="FNanchor_60:1_268" id="FNanchor_60:1_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_60:1_268" class="fnanchor">[60:1]</a></p>

<p>Almost all nations of antiquity have legends of their holy men ascending
a <i>mountain</i> to ask counsel of the gods, such places being invested with
peculiar sanctity, and deemed nearer to the deities than other portions
of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_60:2_269" id="FNanchor_60:2_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_60:2_269" class="fnanchor">[60:2]</a></p>

<p>According to Egyptian belief, it is Thoth, the Deity itself, that speaks
and reveals to his elect among men the will of God and the arcana of
divine things. Portions of them are expressly stated to have been
written by the very finger of Thoth himself; to have been the work and
composition of the great god.<a name="FNanchor_60:3_270" id="FNanchor_60:3_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_60:3_270" class="fnanchor">[60:3]</a></p>

<p>Diodorus, the Grecian historian, says:</p>

<p>The idea promulgated by the ancient Egyptians that their <i>laws</i> were
received direct from the Most High God, <i>has been adopted with success
by many other law-givers, who have thus insured respect for their
institutions</i>.<a name="FNanchor_60:4_271" id="FNanchor_60:4_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_60:4_271" class="fnanchor">[60:4]</a></p>

<p>The Supreme God of the ancient Mexicans was <i>Tezcatlipoca</i>. He occupied
a position corresponding to the Jehovah of the Jews, the Brahma of
India, the Zeus of the Greeks, and the Odin of the Scandinavians. His
name is compounded of Tezcatepec, the name of a <i>mountain</i> (<i>upon which
he is said to have manifested himself to man</i>) <i>tlil</i>, dark, and <i>poca</i>,
smoke. The explanation of this designation is given in the <i>Codex
Vaticanus</i>, as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p><p>Tezcatlipoca was one of their most potent deities; they say he once
appeared on the top of a mountain. They paid him great reverence and
adoration, and addressed him, in their prayers, as "Lord, whose servant
we are." No man ever saw his face, for he appeared only "as a shade."
Indeed, the Mexican idea of the godhead was similar to that of the Jews.
Like Jehovah, Tezcatlipoca dwelt in the "midst of thick darkness." <i>When
he descended upon the mount of Tezcatepec, darkness overshadowed the
earth, while fire and water, in mingled streams, flowed from beneath his
feet, from its summit.</i><a name="FNanchor_61:1_272" id="FNanchor_61:1_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_61:1_272" class="fnanchor">[61:1]</a></p>

<p>Thus, we see that other nations, beside the Hebrews, believed that their
laws were actually received from God, that they had legends to that
effect, and that a <i>mountain</i> figures conspicuously in the stories.</p>

<p>Professor Oort, speaking on this subject, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"No one who has any knowledge of antiquity will be surprised
at this, for similar beliefs were very common. All peoples who
had issued from a life of barbarism and acquired regular
political institutions, more or less elaborate laws, and
established worship, and maxims of morality, attributed all
this&mdash;their birth as a nation, so to speak&mdash;to one or more
great men, all of whom, without exception, <i>were supposed to
have received their knowledge from some deity</i>.</p>

<p>"Whence did Zoroaster, the prophet of the Persians, derive his
religion? According to the beliefs of his followers, and the
doctrines of their sacred writings, it was from Ahuramazda,
the God of light. Why did the Egyptians represent the god
Thoth with a writing tablet and a pencil in his hand, and
honor him especially as the god of the priests? Because he was
'the Lord of the divine Word,' the foundation of all wisdom,
from whose inspiration the priests, who were the scholars, the
lawyers, and the religious teachers of the people, derived all
their wisdom. Was not Minos, the law-giver of the Cretans, the
friend of Zeus, the highest of the gods? Nay, was he not even
his son, and did he not ascend to the sacred cave on Mount
Dicte to bring down the laws which his god had placed there
for him? From whom did the Spartan law-giver, Lycurgus,
himself say that he had obtained his laws? From no other than
the god Apollo. The Roman legend, too, in honoring Numa
Pompilius as the people's instructor, at the same time
ascribed all his wisdom to his intercourse with the nymph
Egeria. It was the same elsewhere; and to make one more
example,&mdash;this from later times&mdash;Mohammed not only believed
himself to have been called immediately by God to be the
prophet of the Arabs, but declared that he had received every
page of the Koran from the hand of the angel Gabriel."<a name="FNanchor_61:2_273" id="FNanchor_61:2_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_61:2_273" class="fnanchor">[61:2]</a></p></div>

It was a common belief among ancient Pagan nations that the gods
appeared and conversed with men. As an illustration we may cite the
following, related by <i>Herodotus</i>, the Grecian historian, who, in
speaking of Egypt and the Egyptians, says: "There is a large city called
Chemmis, situated in the Thebaic district, near Neapolis, in which is a

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>SAMSON AND HIS EXPLOITS.</h3>

<p>This Israelite hero is said to have been born at a time when the
children of Israel were in the hands of the Philistines. His mother, who
had been barren for a number of years, is entertained by an angel, who
informs her that she shall conceive, and bear a son,<a name="FNanchor_62:1_274" id="FNanchor_62:1_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_62:1_274" class="fnanchor">[62:1]</a> and that the
child shall be a <i>Nazarite</i> unto God, from the womb, and he shall begin
to deliver Israel out of the hands of the Philistines.</p>

<p>According to the prediction of the angel, "the woman bore a son, and
called his name <i>Samson</i>; and the child grew, and the Lord blessed him."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And Samson (after he had grown to man's estate), went down to
Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the
Philistines. And he came up and told his father and his
mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the
daughters of the Philistines; now therefore get her for me to
wife."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p><p>Samson's father and mother preferred that he should take a woman among
the daughters of their own tribe, but Samson wished for the maid of the
Philistines, "for," said he, "she pleaseth me well."</p>

<p>The parents, after coming to the conclusion that it was the will of the
Lord, that he should marry the maid of the Philistines, consented.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to
Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath, and, behold, a
young lion roared against him (Samson). And the spirit of the
Lord came mightily upon him, and he rent him (the lion) as he
would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand."</p></div>

<p>This was Samson's <i>first</i> exploit, which he told not to any one, not
even his father, or his mother.</p>

<p>He then continued on his way, and went down and talked with the woman,
and she pleased him well.</p>

<p>And, after a time, he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see
the carcass of the lion, and behold, "there was a swarm of bees, and
honey, in the carcass of the lion."</p>

<p>Samson made a feast at his wedding, which lasted for <i>seven</i> days. At
this feast, there were brought thirty companions to be with him, unto
whom he said: "I will now put forth a riddle unto you, if ye can
certainly declare it me, within the <i>seven</i> days of the feast, and find
it out, then I will give you thirty sheets, and thirty changes of
garments. But, if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty
sheets, and thirty changes of garments." And they said unto him, "Put
forth thy riddle, that we may hear it." And he answered them: "Out of
the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness."</p>

<p>This riddle the thirty companions could not solve.</p>

<p>"And it came to pass, on the <i>seventh</i> day, that they said unto Samson's
wife: 'Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle.'"</p>

<p>She accordingly went to Samson, and told him that he could not love her;
if it were so, he would tell her the answer to the riddle. After she had
wept and entreated of him, he finally told her, and she gave the answer
to the children of her people. "And the men of the city said unto him,
on the <i>seventh</i> day, before the sun went down, 'What is sweeter than
honey, and what is stronger than a lion?'"</p>

<p>Samson, upon hearing this, suspected how they managed to find out the
answer, whereupon he said unto them: "If ye had not ploughed with my
heifer, ye had not found out my riddle."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p><p>Samson was then at a loss to know where to get the thirty sheets, and
the thirty changes of garments; but, "the spirit of the Lord came upon
him, and he went down to Ashkelon, <i>and slew thirty men of them</i>, and
took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded
the riddle."</p>

<p>This was the hero's <i>second</i> exploit.</p>

<p>His anger being kindled, he went up to his father's house, instead of
returning to his wife.<a name="FNanchor_64:1_275" id="FNanchor_64:1_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_64:1_275" class="fnanchor">[64:1]</a> But it came to pass, that, after a while,
Samson repented of his actions, and returned to his wife's house, and
wished to go in to his wife in the chamber; but her father would not
suffer him to go. And her father said: "I verily thought that thou hadst
utterly hated her, therefore, I gave her to thy companion. Is not her
younger sister fairer than she? Take her, I pray thee, instead of her."</p>

<p>This did not seem to please Samson, even though the younger was fairer
than the older, for he "went and caught three hundred foxes, and took
firebrands, and turned (the foxes) tail to tail, and put a firebrand in
the midst between two tails. And when he had set the brands on fire, he
let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burned up
both the shocks and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and
olives."</p>

<p>This was Samson's <i>third</i> exploit.</p>

<p>When the Philistines found their corn, their vineyards, and their olives
burned, they said: "Who hath done this?"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And they answered, 'Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite,
because he had taken his wife, and given her to his
companion.' And the Philistines came up, and burned her and
her father with fire. And Samson said unto them: 'Though ye
have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I
will cease.' <i>And he smote them hip and thigh with a great
slaughter</i>, and he went and dwelt in the top of the rock
Etam."</p></div>

<p>This "great slaughter" was Samson's <i>fourth</i> exploit.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and
spread themselves in Lehi. And the men of Judah said: 'Why are
ye come up against us?' And they answered: 'To bind Samson are
we come up, and to do to him as he hath done to us.' Then
three thousand men of Judah went up to the top of the rock
Etam, and said to Samson: 'Knowest thou not that the
Philistines are rulers over us? What is this that thou hast
done unto us?' And he said unto them: 'As they did unto me, so
have I done unto them.' And they said unto him: 'We are come
down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hands of
the Philistines.' And Samson said unto them: 'Swear unto me
that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.' And they spake unto
him, saying, 'No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee
into their hands: but surely we will not kill thee.' And they
bound him with two new cords, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>brought him up from the
rock. And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted
against him; and the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon
him, <i>and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax
that was burned with fire, and his bands loosed from off his
hands</i>. And he found a new jaw-bone of an ass, and put forth
his hand and took it, <i>and slew a thousand men with it</i>."</p></div>

<p>This was Samson's <i>fifth</i> exploit.</p>

<p>After slaying a thousand men he was "sore athirst," and called unto the
Lord. And "God clave a hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came
water thereout, and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he
revived."<a name="FNanchor_65:1_276" id="FNanchor_65:1_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_65:1_276" class="fnanchor">[65:1]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Then went Samson to Gaza and saw there a harlot, and went in
unto her. And it was told the Gazites, saying, 'Samson is come
hither.' And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all
night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night,
saying: 'In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.'
And Samson lay (with the harlot) till midnight, and arose at
midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the
two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them
upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of a hill
that is in Hebron."</p></div>

<p>This was Samson's <i>sixth</i> exploit.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the
valley of Soreck, whose name was Delilah. And the lords of the
Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her: 'Entice him,
and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we
may prevail against him.'"</p></div>

<p>Delilah then began to entice Samson to tell her wherein his strength
lay.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"She pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that
his soul was vexed unto death. Then he told her all his heart,
and said unto her: 'There hath not come a razor upon mine
head, for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's
womb. If I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I
shall become weak, and be like any other man.' And when
Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she went and
called for the lords of the Philistines, saying: 'Come up this
once, for he hath showed me all his heart.' Then the lords of
the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their
hands (for her).</p>

<p>"And she made him (Samson) sleep upon her knees; and she
called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the <i>seven</i>
locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his
strength went from him."</p></div>

<p>The Philistines then took him, put out his eyes, and put him in prison.
And being gathered together at a great sacrifice in honor of their God,
Dagon, they said: "Call for Samson, that he may make us sport." And they
called for Samson, and he made them sport.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand.
Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house
standeth, that I may lean upon them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>"Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords
of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof
about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson
made sport.</p>

<p>"And Samson called unto the Lord, and said: 'O Lord God,
remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only
this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the
Philistines for my two eyes.'</p>

<p>"And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the
house stood and on which it was borne up, of the one with his
right hand, and of the other with his left. And Samson said:
'Let me die with the Philistines.' And he bowed himself with
all his might; and (having regained his strength) the house
fell upon the lords, and upon the people that were therein. So
the dead which he slew at his death, were more than they which
he slew in his life."<a name="FNanchor_66:1_277" id="FNanchor_66:1_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_66:1_277" class="fnanchor">[66:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Thus ended the career of the "strong man" of the Hebrews.</p>

<p>That this story is a copy of the legends related of Hercules, or that
they have both been copied from similar legends existing among some
other nations,<a name="FNanchor_66:2_278" id="FNanchor_66:2_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_66:2_278" class="fnanchor">[66:2]</a> is too evident to be disputed. Many churchmen have
noticed the similarity between the history of Samson and that of
Hercules. In Chambers's <ins class="corr" title="original has Encylop&aelig;dia">Encyclop&aelig;dia</ins>, under "Samson," we read as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It has been matter of most contradictory speculations, how
far his existence is to be taken as a reality, or, in other
words, what substratum of historical truth there may be in
this supposed circle of popular legends, artistically rounded
off, in the four chapters of Judges which treat of him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"The miraculous deeds he performed have taxed the ingenuity of
many commentators, and the text has been <i>twisted and turned
in all directions</i>, to explain, <i>rationally</i>, his slaying
those prodigious numbers single-handed; his carrying the gates
of Gaza, in one night, a distance of about fifty miles, &amp;c.,
&amp;c."</p></div>

<p>That this is simply a <i>Solar</i> myth, no one will doubt, we believe, who
will take the trouble to investigate it.</p>

<p>Prof. Goldziher, who has made "Comparative Mythology" a special study,
says of this story:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The most complete and rounded-off <i>Solar myth</i> extant in
Hebrew, is that of Shimsh&ocirc;n (Samson), a cycle of mythical
conceptions fully comparable with the Greek myth of
Hercules."<a name="FNanchor_66:3_279" id="FNanchor_66:3_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_66:3_279" class="fnanchor">[66:3]</a></p></div>

<p>We shall now endeavor to ascertain if such is the case, by comparing the
exploits of Samson with those of Hercules.</p>

<p>The first wonderful act performed by Samson was, as we have seen, <i>that
of slaying a lion</i>. This is said to have happened when he was but a
youth. So likewise was it with Hercules. At the age of eighteen, he slew
an enormous lion.<a name="FNanchor_66:4_280" id="FNanchor_66:4_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_66:4_280" class="fnanchor">[66:4]</a></p>

<p>The valley of Nemea was infested by a terrible lion; Eurystheus ordered
Hercules to bring him the skin of this monster. After <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>using in vain his
club and arrows against the lion, Hercules strangled the animal with his
hands. He returned, carrying the dead lion on his shoulders; but
Eurystheus was so frightened at the sight of it, and at this proof of
the prodigious strength of the hero, that he ordered him to deliver the
accounts of his exploits in the future outside the town.<a name="FNanchor_67:1_281" id="FNanchor_67:1_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_67:1_281" class="fnanchor">[67:1]</a></p>

<p>To show the courage of Hercules, it is said that he entered the cave
where the lion's lair was, closed the entrance behind him, and at once
grappled with the monster.<a name="FNanchor_67:2_282" id="FNanchor_67:2_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_67:2_282" class="fnanchor">[67:2]</a></p>

<p>Samson is said to have torn asunder the <i>jaws</i> of the lion, and we find
him generally represented slaying the beast in that manner. So likewise,
was this the manner in which Hercules disposed of the Nemean lion.<a name="FNanchor_67:3_283" id="FNanchor_67:3_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_67:3_283" class="fnanchor">[67:3]</a></p>

<p>The skin of the lion, Hercules tore off with his fingers, and knowing it
to be impenetrable, resolved to wear it henceforth.<a name="FNanchor_67:4_284" id="FNanchor_67:4_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_67:4_284" class="fnanchor">[67:4]</a> The statues
and paintings of Hercules either represent him carrying the lion's skin
over his arm, or wearing it hanging down his back, the skin of its head
fitting to his crown like a cap, and the fore-legs knotted under his
chin.<a name="FNanchor_67:5_285" id="FNanchor_67:5_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_67:5_285" class="fnanchor">[67:5]</a></p>

<p>Samson's second exploit was when he went down to Ashkelon and slew
thirty men.</p>

<p>Hercules, when returning to Thebes from the lion-hunt, and wearing its
skin hanging from his shoulders, as a sign of his success, met the
heralds of the King of the Miny&aelig;, coming from Orchomenos to claim the
annual tribute of a hundred cattle, levied on Thebes. Hercules cut off
the ears and noses of the heralds, bound their hands, and sent them
home.<a name="FNanchor_67:6_286" id="FNanchor_67:6_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_67:6_286" class="fnanchor">[67:6]</a></p>

<p>Samson's third exploit was when he caught three hundred foxes, and took
fire-brands, and turned them tail to tail, and put a fire-brand in the
midst between two tails, and let them go into the standing corn of the
Philistines.</p>

<p>There is no such feature as this in the legends of Hercules, the nearest
to it in resemblance is when he encounters and kills the Learnean
Hydra.<a name="FNanchor_67:7_287" id="FNanchor_67:7_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_67:7_287" class="fnanchor">[67:7]</a> During this encounter a <i>fire-brand</i> figures conspicuously,
and <i>the neighboring wood is set on fire</i>.<a name="FNanchor_67:8_288" id="FNanchor_67:8_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_67:8_288" class="fnanchor">[67:8]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p><p>We have, however, an explanation of this portion of the legend, in the
following from Prof. Steinthal:</p>

<p>At the festival of Ceres, held at Rome, in the month of April, a
fox-hunt through the circus was indulged in, <i>in which burning torches
were bound to the foxes' tails</i>.</p>

<p>This was intended to be a symbolical reminder of the damage done to the
fields by mildew, called the "<i>red fox</i>," which was exorcised in various
ways at this momentous season (the last third of April). It is the time
of the <i>Dog-Star</i>, at which the mildew was most to be feared; if at that
time great solar heat follows too close upon the hoar-frost or dew of
the cold nights, this mischief rages like a burning fox through the
corn-fields.<a name="FNanchor_68:1_289" id="FNanchor_68:1_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_68:1_289" class="fnanchor">[68:1]</a></p>

<p>He also says that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This is the sense of the story of the foxes, which Samson
caught and sent into the Philistines' fields, with fire-brands
fastened to their tails, to burn the crops. Like the lion, the
fox is an animal that indicated the solar heat, being well
suited for this both by its color and by its long-haired
tail."<a name="FNanchor_68:2_290" id="FNanchor_68:2_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_68:2_290" class="fnanchor">[68:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Bouchart, in his "Hierozoicon," observes that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"At this period (<i>i. e.</i>, the last third of April) they cut
the corn in Palestine and Lower Egypt, and a few days after
the setting of the Hyads arose the <i>Fox</i>, in whose train or
tail comes the fires or torches of the dog-days, represented
among the Egyptians by red marks painted on the backs of their
animals."<a name="FNanchor_68:3_291" id="FNanchor_68:3_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_68:3_291" class="fnanchor">[68:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Count de Volney also tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The inhabitants of Carseoles, an ancient city of Latium,
every year, in a religious festival, burned a number of foxes
<i>with torches tied to their tails</i>. They gave, as the reason
for this whimsical ceremony, that their corn had been formerly
burnt by a fox to whose tail a young man had fastened a bundle
of lighted straw."[68:4]</p></div>

<p>He concludes his account of this peculiar "religious festival," by
saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This is exactly the story of Samson with the Philistines, but
it is a Phenician tale. <i>Car-Seol</i> is a compound word in that
tongue, signifying <i>town of foxes</i>. The Philistines,
originally from Egypt, do not appear to have had any colonies.
The Phenicians had a great many; and it can scarcely be
admitted that they borrowed this story from the Hebrews, as
obscure as the Druses are in our own times, or that a simple
adventure gave rise to a religious ceremony; <i>it evidently can
only be a mythological and allegorical narration</i>."<a name="FNanchor_68:4_292" id="FNanchor_68:4_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_68:4_292" class="fnanchor">[68:4]</a></p></div>

<p>So much, then, for the foxes and fire-brands.</p>

<p>Samson's fourth exploit was when he smote the Philistines "hip and
thigh," "with great slaughter."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p><p>It is related of Hercules that he had a combat with an <i>army</i> of
Centaurs, who were armed with pine sticks, rocks, axes, &amp;c. They flocked
in wild confusion, and surrounded the <i>cave</i> of Pholos, where Hercules
was, when a violent fight ensued. Hercules was obliged to contend
against this large armed force single-handed, but he came off
victorious, and slew a great number of them.<a name="FNanchor_69:1_293" id="FNanchor_69:1_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_69:1_293" class="fnanchor">[69:1]</a> Hercules also
encountered and fought against <i>an army of giants</i>, at the Phlegraean
fields, near Cumae.<a name="FNanchor_69:2_294" id="FNanchor_69:2_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_69:2_294" class="fnanchor">[69:2]</a></p>

<p>Samson's next wonderful exploit was when "three thousand men of Judah"
bound him with <i>cords</i> and brought him up into Lehi, when the
Philistines were about to take his life. The cords with which he was
bound immediately became as flax, and loosened from off his hands. He
then, with the jaw-bone of an ass, slew one thousand Philistines.<a name="FNanchor_69:3_295" id="FNanchor_69:3_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_69:3_295" class="fnanchor">[69:3]</a></p>

<p>A very similar feature to this is found in the history of Hercules. He
is made prisoner by the Egyptians, who wish to take his life, but while
they are preparing to slay him, he breaks loose his bonds&mdash;having been
tied with <i>cords</i>&mdash;and kills Buseris, the leader of the band, <i>and the
whole retinue</i>.<a name="FNanchor_69:4_296" id="FNanchor_69:4_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_69:4_296" class="fnanchor">[69:4]</a></p>

<p>On another occasion, being refused shelter from a storm at Kos, he was
enraged at the inhabitants, and accordingly <i>destroyed the whole
town</i>.<a name="FNanchor_69:5_297" id="FNanchor_69:5_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_69:5_297" class="fnanchor">[69:5]</a></p>

<p>Samson, after he had slain a thousand Philistines, was "sore athirst,"
and called upon <i>Jehovah</i>, his father in heaven, to succor him,
whereupon, water immediately gushed forth from "a hollow place that was
in the jaw-bone."</p>

<p>Hercules, departing from the Indies (or rather Ethiopia), and conducting
his army through the desert of Lybia, feels a burning thirst, and
conjures <i>Ihou</i>, his father, to succor him in his danger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p><p>Instantly the (celestial) Ram appears. Hercules follows him and arrives
at a place where the Ram scrapes with his foot, <i>and there instantly
comes forth a spring of water</i>.<a name="FNanchor_70:1_298" id="FNanchor_70:1_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_70:1_298" class="fnanchor">[70:1]</a></p>

<p>Samson's sixth exploit happened when he went to Gaza to visit a harlot.
The Gazites, who wished to take his life, laid wait for him all night,
but Samson left the town at midnight, and took with him the gates of the
city, and the <i>two posts</i>, on his shoulders. He carried them to the top
of a hill, some fifty miles away, and left them there.</p>

<p>This story very much resembles that of the "Pillars of Hercules," called
the "<i>Gates of Cadiz</i>."<a name="FNanchor_70:2_299" id="FNanchor_70:2_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_70:2_299" class="fnanchor">[70:2]</a></p>

<p>Count de Volney tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Hercules was represented naked, carrying on his shoulders
<i>two columns</i> called the Gates of Cadiz."<a name="FNanchor_70:3_300" id="FNanchor_70:3_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_70:3_300" class="fnanchor">[70:3]</a></p></div>

<p>"The <i>Pillars</i> of Hercules" was the name given by the ancients to the
two rocks forming the entrance or <i>gate</i> to the Mediterranean at the
Strait of Gibraltar.<a name="FNanchor_70:4_301" id="FNanchor_70:4_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_70:4_301" class="fnanchor">[70:4]</a> Their erection was ascribed by the Greeks to
Hercules, on the occasion of his journey to the kingdom of Geryon.
According to one version of the story, they had been united, but
Hercules tore them asunder.<a name="FNanchor_70:5_302" id="FNanchor_70:5_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_70:5_302" class="fnanchor">[70:5]</a></p>

<a name="Fig_3" id="Fig_3"></a><img src="images/3_pg70.png" width="307" height="237" alt="Hercules carrying two pillars" />
</div>

<p>Fig. No. 3 is a representation of Hercules with the two posts or pillars
on his shoulders, as alluded to by Count de Volney. We have taken it
from Montfaucon's "L'Antiquit&eacute; Expliqu&eacute;e."<a name="FNanchor_70:6_303" id="FNanchor_70:6_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_70:6_303" class="fnanchor">[70:6]</a></p>

<p>J. P. Lundy says of this:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"Hercules carrying his two columns to erect at the Straits of
Gibraltar, may have some reference to the Hebrew story."<a name="FNanchor_71:1_304" id="FNanchor_71:1_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_71:1_304" class="fnanchor">[71:1]</a></p></div>

<p>We think there is no doubt of it. By changing the name Hercules into
Samson, the legend is complete.</p>

<p>Sir William Drummond tells us, in his "&OElig;dipus Judaicus," that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Gaza</i> signifies a Goat, and was the type of the Sun in
Capricorn. The <i>Gates of the Sun</i> were feigned by the ancient
Astronomers to be in Capricorn and Cancer (that is, in
<i>Gaza</i>), from which signs the tropics are named. Samson
carried away the gates from Gaza to Hebron, the city of
conjunction. Now, Count Gebelin tells us that at Cadiz, where
Hercules was anciently worshiped, there was a representation
of him, <i>with a gate on his shoulders</i>."<a name="FNanchor_71:2_305" id="FNanchor_71:2_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_71:2_305" class="fnanchor">[71:2]</a></p></div>

<p>The stories of the amours of Samson with Delilah and other females, are
simply counterparts of those of Hercules with Omphale and Iole.
Montfaucon, speaking of this, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Nothing is better known in the fables (related of Hercules)
than his amours with Omphale and Iole."<a name="FNanchor_71:3_306" id="FNanchor_71:3_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_71:3_306" class="fnanchor">[71:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Prof. Steinthal says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The circumstance that Samson is so addicted to sexual
pleasure, has its origin in the remembrance that the <i>Solar
god</i> is the god of fruitfulness and procreation. We have as
examples, the amours of Hercules and Omphale; Ninyas, in
Assyria, with Semiramis; Samson, in Philistia, with Delila,
whilst among the Phenicians, Melkart pursues Dido-Anna."<a name="FNanchor_71:4_307" id="FNanchor_71:4_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_71:4_307" class="fnanchor">[71:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Samson is said to have had long hair. "There hath not come a razor upon
my head," says he, "for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's
womb."</p>

<p>Now, strange as it may appear, Hercules is said to have had long hair
also, and he was often represented that way. In Montfaucon's
"L'Antiquit&eacute; Expliqu&eacute;e"<a name="FNanchor_71:5_308" id="FNanchor_71:5_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_71:5_308" class="fnanchor">[71:5]</a> may be seen a representation of Hercules
<i>with hair reaching almost to his waist</i>. Almost all <i>Sun</i>-gods are
represented thus.<a name="FNanchor_71:6_309" id="FNanchor_71:6_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_71:6_309" class="fnanchor">[71:6]</a></p>

<p>Prof. Goldzhier says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Long locks of hair and a long beard are mythological
attributes of the Sun. The Sun's rays are compared with locks
of hair on the face or head of the Sun.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>"When the sun sets and leaves his place to the darkness, or
when the powerful Summer Sun is succeeded by the weak rays of
the Winter Sun, then Samson's long locks, in which alone his
strength lies, are cut off through the treachery of his
deceitful concubine, Delilah, the 'languishing, languid,'
according to the meaning of the name (Delilah). The Beaming
Apollo, moreover, is called the <i>Unshaven</i>; and Minos cannot
conquer the solar hero Nisos, <i>till the latter loses his
golden hair</i>."<a name="FNanchor_72:1_310" id="FNanchor_72:1_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_72:1_310" class="fnanchor">[72:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Through the influence of Delilah, Samson is at last made a prisoner. He
tells her the secret of his strength, the <i>seven</i> locks of hair are
shaven off, and his strength leaves him. The shearing of the locks of
the Sun must be followed by darkness and ruin.</p>

<p>From the shoulders of Phoibos Lyk&ecirc;g&ecirc;nes flow the sacred locks, over
which no razor might pass, and on the head of Nisos they become a
palladium, invested with a mysterious power.<a name="FNanchor_72:2_311" id="FNanchor_72:2_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_72:2_311" class="fnanchor">[72:2]</a> The long locks of
hair which flow over his shoulders are taken from his head by Skylla,
while he is asleep, and, like another Delilah, she thus delivers him and
his people into the power of Minos.<a name="FNanchor_72:3_312" id="FNanchor_72:3_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_72:3_312" class="fnanchor">[72:3]</a></p>

<p>Prof. Steinthal says of Samson:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"His hair is a figure of increase and luxuriant fullness. In
Winter, when nature appears to have lost all strength, the god
of growing young life has lost his hair. In the Spring the
hair grows again, and nature returns to life again. Of this
original conception the Bible story still preserves a trace.
Samson's hair, after being cut off, grows again, and his
strength comes back with it."<a name="FNanchor_72:4_313" id="FNanchor_72:4_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_72:4_313" class="fnanchor">[72:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Towards the end of his career, Samson's eyes are put out. Even here, the
Hebrew writes with a singular fidelity to the old mythical speech. The
tender light of evening is blotted out by the dark vapors; the light of
the <i>Sun</i> is quenched in gloom. <i>Samson's eyes are put out.</i></p>

<p>&OElig;dipus, whose history resembles that of Samson and Hercules in many
respects, tears out his eyes, towards the end of his career. In other
words, the <i>Sun</i> has blinded himself. Clouds and darkness have closed in
about him, and the clear light is blotted out of the heaven.<a name="FNanchor_72:5_314" id="FNanchor_72:5_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_72:5_314" class="fnanchor">[72:5]</a></p>

<p>The final act, Samson's death, reminds us clearly and decisively of the
Phenician Hercules, as Sun-god, who died at the Winter Solstice in the
furthest West, where his <i>two pillars</i> are set up to mark the end of his
wanderings.</p>

<p>Samson also died at the <i>two pillars</i>, but in his case they are not the
Pillars of the World, but are only set up in the middle of a great
banqueting-hall. A feast was being held in honor of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>Dagon, the
Fish-god; the Sun was in the sign of the Waterman, <i>Samson, the Sun-god,
died</i>.<a name="FNanchor_73:1_315" id="FNanchor_73:1_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_73:1_315" class="fnanchor">[73:1]</a></p>

<p>The ethnology of the <i>name</i> of Samson, as well as his adventures, are
very closely connected with the <i>Solar</i> Hercules. <i>"Samson" was the name
of the Sun.</i><a name="FNanchor_73:2_316" id="FNanchor_73:2_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_73:2_316" class="fnanchor">[73:2]</a> In Arabic, "<i>Shams-on</i>" means the <i>Sun</i>.<a name="FNanchor_73:3_317" id="FNanchor_73:3_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_73:3_317" class="fnanchor">[73:3]</a> Samson
had <i>seven</i> locks of hair, the number of the planetary bodies.<a name="FNanchor_73:4_318" id="FNanchor_73:4_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_73:4_318" class="fnanchor">[73:4]</a></p>

<p>The author of "The Religion of Israel," speaking of Samson, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The story of Samson and his deeds originated in a <i>Solar
myth</i>, which was afterwards transformed by the narrator into a
<i>saga</i> about a mighty hero and deliverer of Israel. The very
<i>name</i> 'Samson,' is derived from the Hebrew word, and means
'Sun.' The hero's flowing locks were originally the <i>rays of
the sun</i>, and other traces of the old myth have been
preserved."<a name="FNanchor_73:5_319" id="FNanchor_73:5_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_73:5_319" class="fnanchor">[73:5]</a></p></div>

<p>Prof. Oort says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The story of Samson is simply a solar myth. In some of the
features of the story the original meaning may be traced quite
clearly, but in others the myth can no longer be recognized.
The exploits of some Danite hero, such as Shamgar, who 'slew
six hundred Philistines with an ox-goad' (Judges iii. 31),
have been woven into it; the whole has been remodeled after
the ideas of the prophets of later ages, and finally, it has
been fitted into the framework of the period of the Judges, as
conceived by the writer of the book called after them."<a name="FNanchor_73:6_320" id="FNanchor_73:6_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_73:6_320" class="fnanchor">[73:6]</a></p></div>

<p>Again he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The myth that lies at the foundation of this story is a
description of the sun's course during the six winter months.
The god is gradually encompassed by his enemies, mist and
darkness. At first he easily maintains his freedom, and gives
glorious proofs of his strength; but the fetters grow stronger
and stronger, until at last he is robbed of his crown of rays,
and loses all his power and glory. <i>Such is the Sun in
Winter.</i> But he has not lost his splendor forever. Gradually
his strength returns, at last he reappears; and though he
still seems to allow himself to be mocked, yet the power of
avenging himself has returned, and in the end he triumphs over
his enemies once more."<a name="FNanchor_73:7_321" id="FNanchor_73:7_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_73:7_321" class="fnanchor">[73:7]</a></p></div>

<p>Other nations beside the Hebrews and Greeks had their "mighty men" and
lion-killers. The Hindoos had their Samson. His name was Bala-Rama, the
"<i>Strong Rama</i>." He was considered by some an incarnation of
Vishnu.<a name="FNanchor_73:8_322" id="FNanchor_73:8_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_73:8_322" class="fnanchor">[73:8]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p><p>Captain Wilford says, in "Asiatic Researches:"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>Indian</i> Hercules, according to Cicero, was called
<i>Belus</i>. He is the same as <i>Bala</i>, the brother of Crishna, and
both are conjointly worshiped at Mutra; indeed, they are
considered as one Avatar or Incarnation of Vishnou. <i>Bala</i> is
represented as a stout man, <i>with a club in his hand</i>. He is
also called <i>Bala-rama.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_74:1_323" id="FNanchor_74:1_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_74:1_323" class="fnanchor">[74:1]</a></p></div>

<p>There is a Hindoo legend which relates that Sevah had an encounter with
a tiger, "whose mouth expanded like a cave, and whose voice resembled
thunder." He slew the monster, and, like Hercules, covered himself with
the skin.<a name="FNanchor_74:2_324" id="FNanchor_74:2_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_74:2_324" class="fnanchor">[74:2]</a></p>

<p>The Assyrians and Lydians, both Semitic nations, worshiped a Sun-god
named Sandan or Sandon. He also was believed to be a <i>lion-killer</i>, and
frequently figured struggling with the lion, or standing upon the slain
lion.<a name="FNanchor_74:3_325" id="FNanchor_74:3_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_74:3_325" class="fnanchor">[74:3]</a></p>

<p>Ninevah, too, had her mighty hero and king, who slew a lion and other
monsters. Layard, in his excavations, discovered a <i>bas-relief</i>
representation of this hero triumphing over the lion and wild
bull.<a name="FNanchor_74:4_326" id="FNanchor_74:4_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_74:4_326" class="fnanchor">[74:4]</a></p>

<p>The Ancient Babylonians had a hero lion-slayer, Izdubar by name. The
destruction of the lion, and other monsters, by Izdubar, is often
depicted on the cylinders and engraved gems belonging to the early
Babylonian monarchy.<a name="FNanchor_74:5_327" id="FNanchor_74:5_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_74:5_327" class="fnanchor">[74:5]</a></p>

<p>Izdubar is represented as a great or mighty man, who, in the early days
after the flood, destroyed wild animals, and conquered a number of petty
kings.<a name="FNanchor_74:6_328" id="FNanchor_74:6_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_74:6_328" class="fnanchor">[74:6]</a></p>

<p>Izdubar resembles the Grecian hero, Hercules, in other respects than as
a destroyer of wild animals, &amp;c. We are told that he "wandered to the
regions where gigantic composite monsters held and controlled the rising
and setting sun, from these learned the road to <i>the region of the
blessed</i>, and passing across <i>a great waste of land</i>, he arrived at a
region where <i>splendid trees were laden with jewels</i>."<a name="FNanchor_74:7_329" id="FNanchor_74:7_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_74:7_329" class="fnanchor">[74:7]</a></p>

<p>He also resembles Hercules, Samson, and other solar-gods, in the
particular of <i>long flowing locks of hair</i>. In the Babylonian and
Assyrian sculptures he is always represented with a marked physiognomy,
and always indicated as a man with <i>masses of curls over his head</i> and a
large curly beard.<a name="FNanchor_74:8_330" id="FNanchor_74:8_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_74:8_330" class="fnanchor">[74:8]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p><p>Here, evidently, is the Babylonian legend of Hercules. He too was a
<i>wanderer</i>, going from the furthest East to the furthest West. He
crossed "a great waste of land" (the desert of Lybia), visited "the
region of the blessed," where there were "splendid trees laden with
jewels" (golden apples).</p>

<p>The ancient Egyptians had their Hercules. According to Herodotus, he was
known several thousand years before the Grecian hero of that name. This
the Egyptians affirmed, and that he was <i>born</i> in their country.<a name="FNanchor_75:1_331" id="FNanchor_75:1_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_75:1_331" class="fnanchor">[75:1]</a></p>

<p>The story of Hercules was known in the Island of Thasos, by the
Phenician colony settled there, five centuries before he was known in
Greece.<a name="FNanchor_75:2_332" id="FNanchor_75:2_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_75:2_332" class="fnanchor">[75:2]</a> Fig. No. 4 is from an ancient representation of Hercules
in conflict with the lion, taken from Gorio.</p>

</div>

<p>Another mighty hero was the Grecian Bellerophon. The minstrels sang of
the beauty and the great deeds of Bellerophon throughout all the land of
Argos. His arm was strong in battle; his feet were swift in the chase.
None that were poor and weak and wretched feared the might of
Bellerophon. To them the sight of his beautiful form brought only joy
and gladness; but the proud and boastful, the slanderer and the robber,
dreaded the glance of his keen eye. For a long time he fought the Solymi
and the Amazons, until all his enemies shrank from the stroke of his
mighty arm, and sought for mercy.<a name="FNanchor_75:3_333" id="FNanchor_75:3_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_75:3_333" class="fnanchor">[75:3]</a></p>

<p>The second of the principal gods of the Ancient <i>Scandinavians</i> was
named Thor, and was no less known than Odin among the Teutonic nations.
The Edda calls him expressly the most valiant of the sons of Odin. He
was considered the "<i>defender</i>" and "<i>avenger</i>." He always carried a
mallet, which, as often as he discharged it, returned to his hand of
itself; he grasped it with gauntlets of iron, and was further possessed
of a girdle which had the virtue of renewing his strength as often as
was needful. It was with these formidable arms that he overthrew to the
ground the monsters and giants, when he was sent by the gods to oppose
their enemies. He was represented of gigantic size, and as the stoutest
and strongest <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_76:1_334" id="FNanchor_76:1_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_76:1_334" class="fnanchor">[76:1]</a> Thor was simply the Hercules of the
Northern nations. He was the Sun personified.<a name="FNanchor_76:2_335" id="FNanchor_76:2_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_76:2_335" class="fnanchor">[76:2]</a></p>

<p>Without enumerating them, we can safely say, that there was not a nation
of antiquity, from the remotest East to the furthest West, that did not
have its mighty hero, and counterpart of Hercules and Samson.<a name="FNanchor_76:3_336" id="FNanchor_76:3_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_76:3_336" class="fnanchor">[76:3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_62:1_274" id="Footnote_62:1_274"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62:1_274"><span class="label">[62:1]</span></a> The idea of a woman conceiving, and bearing a son in her
old age, seems to have been a Hebrew peculiarity, as a number of their
remarkable personages were born, so it is said, of parents well advanced
in years, or of a woman who was supposed to have been <i>barren</i>. As
illustrations, we may mention this case of <i>Samson</i>, and that of
<i>Joseph</i> being born of Rachel. The beautiful Rachel, who was so much
beloved by Jacob, her husband, was barren, and she bore him no sons.
This caused grief and discontent on her part, and anger on the part of
her husband. In her old age, however, she bore the wonderful child
Joseph. (See Genesis, xxx. 1-29.)</p>

<p><i>Isaac</i> was born of a woman (Sarah) who had been barren many years. <i>An
angel appeared to her</i> when her lord (Abraham) "was ninety years old and
nine," and informed her that she would conceive and bear a son. (See
Gen. xvi.)</p>

<p><i>Samuel</i>, the "holy man," was also born of a woman (Hannah) who had been
barren many years. In grief, she prayed to the Lord for a child, and was
finally comforted by receiving her wish. (See 1 Samuel, i. 1-20.)</p>

<p><i>John the Baptist</i> was also a miraculously conceived infant. His mother,
Elizabeth, bore him <i>in her old age</i>. <i>An angel also informed her</i> and
her husband Zachariah, that this event would take place. (See Luke, i.
1-25.)</p>

<p><i>Mary</i>, the mother of <i>Jesus</i>, was born of a woman (Anna) who was "old
and stricken in years," and who had been barren all her life. <i>An angel
appeared to Anna and her husband</i> (Joachim), and told them what was
about to take place. (See "The Gospel of Mary," Apoc.)</p>

<p>Thus we see, that the idea of a wonderful child being born of a woman
who had passed the age which nature had destined for her to bear
children, and who had been barren all her life, was a favorite one among
the Hebrews. The idea that the ancestors of a race lived to a fabulous
old age, is also a familiar one among the ancients.</p>

<p>Most ancient nations relate in their fables that their ancestors lived
to be very old men. For instance; the <i>Persian</i> patriarch Kaiomaras
reigned 560 years; Jemshid reigned 300 years; Jahmurash reigned 700
years; Dah&acirc;k reigned 1000 years; Feridun reigned 120 years; Manugeher
reigned 500 years; Kaikans reigned 150 years; and Bahaman reigned 112
years. (See Dunlap: Son of the Man, p. 155, <i>note</i>.)</p></div>

<p>It is evident that <i>Herodotus</i>, the Grecian historian, was somewhat of a
skeptic, for he says: "The Grecians say that 'When Hercules arrived in
Egypt, the Egyptians, having crowned him with a garland, led him in
procession, as designing to sacrifice him to Jupiter, and that for some
time he remained quiet, but when they began the preparatory ceremonies
upon him at the altar, he set about defending himself and slew every one
of them.' Now, since Hercules was but one, and, besides, a mere man, as
they confess, how is it possible that he should slay many thousands?"

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>JONAH SWALLOWED BY A BIG FISH.</h3>

<p>In the book of Jonah, containing four chapters, we are told the word of
the Lord came unto Jonah, saying: "Arise, go to Ninevah, that great
city, and cry against it, for their wickedness is come up against me."</p>

<p>Instead of obeying this command Jonah sought to flee "from the presence
of the Lord," by going to Tarshish. For this purpose he went to <i>Joppa</i>,
and there took ship for Tarshish. But the Lord sent a great wind, and
there was a mighty tempest, so that the ship was likely to be broken.</p>

<p>The mariners being afraid, they cried every one unto <i>his</i> God; and
casting lots&mdash;that they might know which of them was the cause of the
storm&mdash;the lot fell upon Jonah, showing him to be the guilty man.</p>

<p>The mariners then said unto him; "What shall we do unto thee?" Jonah in
reply said, "Take me up and cast me forth into the sea, for I know that
for my sake this great tempest is upon you." So they took up Jonah, and
cast him into the sea, and the sea ceased raging.</p>

<p>And the Lord prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah, <i>and Jonah was
in the belly of the fish three days and three nights</i>. Then Jonah prayed
unto the Lord out of the fish's belly. And the Lord spake unto the fish,
and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.</p>

<p>The Lord again spake unto Jonah and said:</p>

<p>"Go unto Ninevah and preach unto it." So Jonah arose and went unto
Ninevah, according to the command of the Lord, and preached unto it.</p>

<p>There is a <i>Hindoo</i> fable, very much resembling this, to be found in the
<i>Somadeva Bhatta</i>, of a person by the name of <i>Saktideva</i> who was
swallowed by a huge fish, and finally came out unhurt. The story is as
follows:</p>

<p>"There was once a king's daughter who would marry no one <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>but the man
who had seen the Golden City&mdash;of legendary fame&mdash;and Saktideva was in
love with her; so he went travelling about the world seeking some one
who could tell him where this Golden City was. In the course of his
journeys <i>he embarked on board a ship</i> bound for the Island of Utsthala,
where lived the King of the Fishermen, who, Saktideva hoped, would set
him on his way. On the voyage <i>there arose a great storm</i> and the ship
went to pieces, <i>and a great fish swallowed Saktideva whole</i>. Then,
driven by the force of fate, the fish went to the Island of Utsthala,
and there the servants of the King of the Fishermen caught it, and the
king, wondering at its size, had it cut open, <i>and Saktideva came out
unhurt</i>."<a name="FNanchor_78:1_337" id="FNanchor_78:1_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_78:1_337" class="fnanchor">[78:1]</a></p>

<p>In Grecian fable, Hercules is said to have been swallowed by a whale, at
a place called Joppa, <i>and to have lain three days in his entrails</i>.</p>

<p>Bernard de Montfaucon, speaking of Jonah being swallowed by a whale, and
describing a piece of Grecian sculpture representing Hercules standing
by a huge sea monster, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Some ancients relate to the effect that Hercules was also
swallowed by the whale that was watching Hesione, <i>that he
remained three days in his belly</i>, and that he came out
bald-pated after his sojourn there."<a name="FNanchor_78:2_338" id="FNanchor_78:2_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_78:2_338" class="fnanchor">[78:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Bouchet, in his "Hist. d'Animal," tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The great fish which swallowed up <i>Jonah</i>, although it be
called a whale (Matt. xii. 40), yet it was not a whale,
properly so called, but a <i>Dog-fish</i>, called <i>Carcharias</i>.
Therefore in the Grecian fable <i>Hercules</i> is said to have been
swallowed up of a <i>Dag</i>, and to have lain three days in his
entrails."<a name="FNanchor_78:3_339" id="FNanchor_78:3_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_78:3_339" class="fnanchor">[78:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Godfrey Higgins says, on this subject:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The story of <i>Jonas</i> swallowed up by a whale, is nothing but
part of the fiction of <i>Hercules</i>, described in the Heracleid
or Labors of Hercules, of whom the same story was told, and
who was swallowed up at the very same place, <i>Joppa</i>, and for
the same period of time, <i>three days</i>. Lycophron says that
Hercules was three nights in the belly of a fish."<a name="FNanchor_78:4_340" id="FNanchor_78:4_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_78:4_340" class="fnanchor">[78:4]</a></p></div>

<p>We have still another similar story in that of "<i>Arion the Musician</i>,"
who, being thrown overboard, was caught on the back of a <i>Dolphin</i> and
landed safe on shore. The story is related in "Tales of Ancient Greece,"
as follows:</p>

<p>Arion was a Corinthian harper who had travelled in Sicily and</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p><p>Italy, and had accumulated great wealth. Being desirous of again seeing
his native city, he set sail from Taras for Corinth. The sailors in the
ship, having seen the large boxes full of money which Arion had brought
with him into the ship, made up their minds to kill him and take his
gold and silver. So one day when he was sitting on the bow of the ship,
and looking down on the dark blue sea, three or four of the sailors came
to him and said they were going to kill him. Now Arion knew they said
this because they wanted his money; so he promised to give them all he
had if they would spare his life. But they would not. Then he asked them
to let him jump into the sea. When they had given him leave to do this,
Arion took one last look at the bright and sunny sky, and then leaped
into the sea, and the sailors saw him no more. But Arion was not drowned
in the sea, for a great fish called a dolphin was swimming by the ship
when Arion leaped over; and it caught him on its back and swam away with
him towards Corinth. So presently the fish came close to the shore and
left Arion on the beach, and swam away again into the deep sea.<a name="FNanchor_79:1_341" id="FNanchor_79:1_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_79:1_341" class="fnanchor">[79:1]</a></p>

<p>There is also a Persian legend to the effect that Jemshid was devoured
by a great monster waiting for him at the bottom of the sea, but
afterwards rises again out of the sea, like Jonah in the Hebrew, and
Hercules in the Phenician myth.<a name="FNanchor_79:2_342" id="FNanchor_79:2_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_79:2_342" class="fnanchor">[79:2]</a> This legend was also found in the
myths of the <i>New World</i>.<a name="FNanchor_79:3_343" id="FNanchor_79:3_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_79:3_343" class="fnanchor">[79:3]</a></p>

<p>It was urged, many years ago, by Rosenm&uuml;ller&mdash;an eminent German divine
and professor of theology&mdash;and other critics, that the miracle recorded
in the book of Jonah is not to be regarded as an historical fact, "<i>but
only as an allegory, founded on the Phenician myth of Hercules rescuing
Hesione from the sea monster by leaping himself into its jaws, and for
three days and three nights continuing to tear its entrails</i>."<a name="FNanchor_79:4_344" id="FNanchor_79:4_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_79:4_344" class="fnanchor">[79:4]</a></p>

<p>That the story is an allegory, and that it, as well as that of
Saktideva, Hercules and the rest, are simply different versions of the
same myth, the significance of which is the alternate swallowing up and
casting forth of <i>Day</i>, or the <i>Sun</i>, by <i>Night</i>, is now all but
universally admitted by scholars. The <i>Day</i>, or the <i>Sun</i>, is swallowed
up by <i>Night</i>, to be set free again at dawn, and from time to time
suffers a like but shorter durance in the maw of the eclipse and the
storm-cloud.<a name="FNanchor_79:5_345" id="FNanchor_79:5_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_79:5_345" class="fnanchor">[79:5]</a></p>

<p>Professor Goldzhier says:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"The most prominent mythical characteristic of the story of
Jonah is his celebrated abode in the sea in the belly of a
whale. This trait is eminently <i>Solar</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As on occasion of
the storm the storm-dragon or the storm-serpent <i>swallows the
Sun</i>, so when he sets, he (Jonah, as a personification of the
Sun) is swallowed by a mighty fish, waiting for him at the
bottom of the sea. Then, when he appears again on the horizon,
he is <i>spit out on the shore</i> by the sea-monster."<a name="FNanchor_80:1_346" id="FNanchor_80:1_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_80:1_346" class="fnanchor">[80:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The <i>Sun</i> was called Jona, as appears from Gruter's inscriptions, and
other sources.<a name="FNanchor_80:2_347" id="FNanchor_80:2_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_80:2_347" class="fnanchor">[80:2]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Vedas</i>&mdash;the four sacred books of the Hindoos&mdash;when <i>Day</i> and
<i>Night</i>, <i>Sun</i> and <i>Darkness</i>, are opposed to each other, the one is
designated <i>Red</i>, the other <i>Black</i>.<a name="FNanchor_80:3_348" id="FNanchor_80:3_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_80:3_348" class="fnanchor">[80:3]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Red Sun</i> being swallowed up by the <i>Dark Earth</i> at <i>Night</i>&mdash;as it
apparently is when it sets in the west&mdash;to be cast forth again at <i>Day</i>,
is also illustrated in like manner. Jonah, Hercules and others personify
the <i>Sun</i>, and a huge <i>Fish</i> represents the <i>Earth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_80:4_349" id="FNanchor_80:4_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_80:4_349" class="fnanchor">[80:4]</a> <i>The Earth
represented as a huge Fish is one of the most prominent ideas of the
Polynesian mythology.</i><a name="FNanchor_80:5_350" id="FNanchor_80:5_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_80:5_350" class="fnanchor">[80:5]</a></p>

<p>At other times, instead of a <i>Fish</i>, we have a great raving <i>Wolf</i>, who
comes to devour its victim and extinguish the <i>Sun</i>-light.<a name="FNanchor_80:6_351" id="FNanchor_80:6_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_80:6_351" class="fnanchor">[80:6]</a> The
Wolf is particularly distinguished in ancient <i>Scandinavian</i> mythology,
being employed as an emblem of the <i>Destroying Power</i>, which attempts to
destroy the <i>Sun</i>.<a name="FNanchor_80:7_352" id="FNanchor_80:7_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_80:7_352" class="fnanchor">[80:7]</a> This is illustrated in the story of Little
<i>Red</i> Riding-Hood (the Sun)<a name="FNanchor_80:8_353" id="FNanchor_80:8_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_80:8_353" class="fnanchor">[80:8]</a> who is devoured by the great <i>Black
Wolf</i> (Night) and afterwards <i>comes out unhurt</i>.<a name="FNanchor_80:9_354" id="FNanchor_80:9_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_80:9_354" class="fnanchor">[80:9]</a></p>

<p>The story of Little Red Riding-Hood <i>is mutilated in the English
version</i>. The original story was that the little maid, in her <i>shining
Red Cloak</i>, was swallowed by the great <i>Black Wolf</i>, and that <i>she came
out safe and sound</i> when the hunters cut open the sleeping beast.<a name="FNanchor_80:10_355" id="FNanchor_80:10_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_80:10_355" class="fnanchor">[80:10]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p><p>In regard to these heroes remaining <i>three days and three nights</i> in
the bowels of the Fish, <i>they represent the Sun at the Winter Solstice</i>.
From December 22d to the 25th&mdash;that is, <i>for three days and three
nights</i>&mdash;the <i>Sun</i> remains in the <i>Lowest Regions</i>, in the bowels of the
Earth, in the belly of the Fish; it is then cast forth and renews its
career.</p>

<p>Thus, we see that the story of Jonah being swallowed by a big fish,
meant originally the Sun swallowed up by Night, and that it is identical
with the well-known nursery-tale. How such legends are transformed from
intelligible into unintelligible myths, is very clearly illustrated by
Prof. Max M&uuml;ller, who, in speaking of "the comparison of the different
forms of Aryan Religion and Mythology," in India, Persia, Greece, Italy
and Germany, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In each of these nations there was a tendency to change the
original conception of divine powers; to misunderstand the
many names given to these powers, and to misinterpret the
praises addressed to them. In this manner some of the divine
names were changed into half-divine, half-human heroes, <i>and
at last the myths which were true and intelligible as told
originally of the Sun, or the Dawn, or the Storms, were turned
into legends or fables too marvellous to be believed of common
mortals</i>. This process can be watched in <i>India</i>, in <i>Greece</i>,
and in <i>Germany</i>. The same story, or nearly the same, is told
of gods, of heroes, and of men. The <i>divine myth</i> became an
<i>heroic legend</i>, and the <i>heroic legend</i> fades away into a
<i>nursery tale</i>. Our nursery tales have well been called the
modern <i>patois</i> of the ancient sacred mythology of the Aryan
race."<a name="FNanchor_81:1_356" id="FNanchor_81:1_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_81:1_356" class="fnanchor">[81:1]</a></p></div>

<p>How striking are these words; how plainly they illustrate the process by
which the story, that was true and intelligible as told originally of
the <i>Day</i> being swallowed up by <i>Night</i>, or the <i>Sun</i> being swallowed up
by the <i>Earth</i>, was transformed into a legend or fable, too marvellous
to be believed by common mortals. How the "<i>divine myth</i>" became an
"<i>heroic legend</i>," and how the heroic legend faded away into a "<i>nursery
tale</i>."</p>

<p>In regard to Jonah's going to the city of Ninevah, and preaching unto
the inhabitants, we believe that the old "Myth of Civilization," <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>so
called,<a name="FNanchor_82:1_357" id="FNanchor_82:1_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_82:1_357" class="fnanchor">[82:1]</a> is partly interwoven here, and that, in this respect, he
is nothing more than the Indian <i>Fish Avatar of Vishnou</i>, or the
Chaldean <i>Oannes</i>. At his first Avatar, <i>Vishnou</i> is alleged to have
appeared to humanity in form like a fish,<a name="FNanchor_82:2_358" id="FNanchor_82:2_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_82:2_358" class="fnanchor">[82:2]</a> or half-man and
half-fish, just as Oannes and Dagon were represented among the Chaldeans
and other nations. In the temple of <i>Rama</i>, in India, there is a
representation of <i>Vishnou</i> which answers perfectly to that of
<i>Dagon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_82:3_359" id="FNanchor_82:3_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_82:3_359" class="fnanchor">[82:3]</a> Mr. Maurice, in his "Hist. Hindostan," has proved the
identity of the Syrian <i>Dagon</i> and the Indian Fish Avatar, and concludes
by saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"From the foregoing and a variety of parallel circumstances, I
am inclined to think that the Chaldean <i>Oannes</i>, the Phenician
and Philistian <i>Dagon</i>, and the <i>Pisces</i> of the Syrian and
Egyptian Zodiac, were the same deity with the Indian
<i>Vishnu</i>."<a name="FNanchor_82:4_360" id="FNanchor_82:4_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_82:4_360" class="fnanchor">[82:4]</a></p></div>

<p>In the old mythological remains of the Chaldeans, compiled by Berosus,
Abydenus, and Polyhistor, there is an account of one <i>Oannes</i>, a
fish-god, who rendered great service to mankind.<a name="FNanchor_82:5_361" id="FNanchor_82:5_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_82:5_361" class="fnanchor">[82:5]</a> This being is
said to have <i>come out of</i> the Erythraean Sea.<a name="FNanchor_82:6_362" id="FNanchor_82:6_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_82:6_362" class="fnanchor">[82:6]</a> This is evidently
<i>the Sun rising out of the sea</i>, as it apparently does, in the
East.<a name="FNanchor_82:7_363" id="FNanchor_82:7_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_82:7_363" class="fnanchor">[82:7]</a></p>

<p>Prof. Goldzhier, speaking of Oannes, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That this founder of <ins class="corr" title="original has cizilization">civilization</ins> has a <i>Solar character</i>,
like similar heroes in all other nations, is shown .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the
words of Berosus, who says: '<i>During the day-time</i> Oannes held
intercourse with man, <i>but when the Sun set</i>, Oannes fell into
the sea, where he used to pass the night.' Here, evidently,
only the <i>Sun</i> can be meant, who, in the evening, dips into
the sea, and comes forth again in the morning, and passes the
day on the dry land in the company of men."<a name="FNanchor_82:8_364" id="FNanchor_82:8_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_82:8_364" class="fnanchor">[82:8]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Dagon</i> was sometimes represented as <i>a man emerging from a fish's
mouth</i>, and sometimes as half-man and half-fish.<a name="FNanchor_82:9_365" id="FNanchor_82:9_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_82:9_365" class="fnanchor">[82:9]</a> It was believed
that he came <i>in a ship</i>, and taught the people. Ancient history abounds
with such mythological personages.<a name="FNanchor_82:10_366" id="FNanchor_82:10_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_82:10_366" class="fnanchor">[82:10]</a> There was also a <i>Durga</i>, a
fish deity, among the <i>Hindoos</i>, represented as <i>a full grown man
emerging from a fish's mouth</i><a href="#Footnote_82:9_365" class="fnanchor">[82:9]</a> The Philistines <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>worshiped Dagon,
and in Babylonian Mythology <i>Odakon</i> is applied to a fish-like being,
who <i>rose from the waters of the Red Sea</i> as one of the benefactors of
men.<a name="FNanchor_83:1_367" id="FNanchor_83:1_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_83:1_367" class="fnanchor">[83:1]</a></p>

<p>On the coins of Ascalon, where she was held in great honor, the goddess
Derceto or Atergatis is represented as a woman with her lower
extremities like a fish. This is Semiramis, who appeared at <i>Joppa</i> as a
mermaid. She is simply a personification of the <i>Moon</i>, who follows the
course of the <i>Sun</i>. At times she manifests herself to the eyes of men,
at others she seeks concealment in the Western flood.<a name="FNanchor_83:2_368" id="FNanchor_83:2_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_83:2_368" class="fnanchor">[83:2]</a></p>

<p>The Sun-god Phoibos traverses the sea in the form of a fish, and imparts
lessons of wisdom and goodness when he has come forth from the green
depths. All these powers or qualities are shared by Proteus in Hellenic
story, as well as by the fish-god, Dagon or Oannes.<a name="FNanchor_83:3_369" id="FNanchor_83:3_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_83:3_369" class="fnanchor">[83:3]</a></p>

<p>In the Iliad and Odyssey, Atlas is brought into close connection with
Helios, the bright god, the Latin Sol, and our Sun. In these poems he
rises every morning from a beautiful lake by the deep-flowing stream of
Ocean, and having accomplished his journey across the heavens, plunges
again into the Western waters.<a name="FNanchor_83:4_370" id="FNanchor_83:4_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_83:4_370" class="fnanchor">[83:4]</a></p>

<p>The ancient Mexicans and Peruvians had likewise semi-fish gods.<a name="FNanchor_83:5_371" id="FNanchor_83:5_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_83:5_371" class="fnanchor">[83:5]</a></p>

<p>Jonah then, is like these other personages, in so far as they are all
<i>personifications of the Sun</i>; they all <i>come out of the sea</i>; they are
all represented as <i>a man emerging from a fish's mouth</i>; and they are
all <i>benefactors of mankind</i>. We believe, therefore, that it is one and
the same myth, whether Oannes, Joannes, or Jonas,<a name="FNanchor_83:6_372" id="FNanchor_83:6_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_83:6_372" class="fnanchor">[83:6]</a> differing to a
certain extent among different nations, just as we find to be the case
with other legends. This we have just seen illustrated in the story of
"Little Red Riding-Hood," which is considerably mutilated in the English
version.</p>

<p>Fig. No. 5 is a representation of <i>Dagon</i>, intended to illustrate a
creature half-man and half-fish; or, perhaps, a man emerging from a
fish's mouth. It is taken from Layard. Fig. No. 6<a name="FNanchor_84:1_373" id="FNanchor_84:1_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_84:1_373" class="fnanchor">[84:1]</a> is a

fish</i>.<a name="FNanchor_84:2_374" id="FNanchor_84:2_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_84:2_374" class="fnanchor">[84:2]</a> It would answer just as well for a representation of Jonah,
as it does for the Hindoo divinity. It should be noticed that in both of
these, the god has a crown on his head, surmounted with a <i>triple</i>
ornament, both of which had evidently the same meaning, <i>i. e.</i>, <i>an
emblem of the trinity</i>.<a name="FNanchor_84:3_375" id="FNanchor_84:3_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_84:3_375" class="fnanchor">[84:3]</a> The Indian Avatar being represented with
four arms, evidently means that he is god of the whole world, his <i>four</i>
arms extending to the <i>four corners of the world</i>. The <i>circle</i>, which
is seen in one hand, is an emblem of eternal reward. The <i>shell</i>, with
its eight convolutions, is intended to show the place in the number of
the cycles which he occupied. The <i>book</i> and <i>sword</i> are to show that he
ruled both in the right of the book and of the sword.<a name="FNanchor_84:4_376" id="FNanchor_84:4_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_84:4_376" class="fnanchor">[84:4]</a></p>

came from the same (<i>i. e.</i>, the ancient Aryan) source, and refers to
the <i>Sun</i> and the <i>Night</i>."</p>

<p>"One of the fancies of the most ancient Aryan or Hindoo stories was that
there was a great dragon that was trying to devour the Sun, and to
prevent him from shining upon the earth and filling it with brightness
and life and beauty, and that Indra, the Sun-god, killed the dragon.
Now, this is the meaning of Little Red Riding-Hood, as it is told in our
nursery tales. Little Red Riding-Hood is the evening Sun, which is
always described as red or golden; the old grandmother is the earth, to
whom the rays of the Sun bring warmth and comfort. The wolf&mdash;which is a
well-known figure for the clouds and darkness of night&mdash;is the dragon in
another form. First he devours the grandmother; that is, he wraps the
earth in thick clouds, which the evening Sun is not strong enough to
pierce through. Then, with the darkness of night, he swallows up the
evening Sun itself, and all is dark and desolate. Then, as in the German
tale, the night-thunder and the storm-winds are represented by the loud
snoring of the wolf; and then the huntsman, the morning Sun, comes in
all his strength and majesty, and chases away the night-clouds and kills
the wolf, and revives old Grandmother Earth, and brings Little Red
Riding-Hood to life again." (Bunce, Fairy Tales, their Origin and
Meaning, p. 161.)</p></div>

<h3>CIRCUMCISION.</h3>

<p>In the words of the Rev. Dr. Giles:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The rite of circumcision must not be passed over in any work
that concerns the religion and literature of that (the Jewish)
people."<a name="FNanchor_85:1_377" id="FNanchor_85:1_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_85:1_377" class="fnanchor">[85:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The first mention of Circumcision, in the Bible, occurs in
Genesis,<a name="FNanchor_85:2_378" id="FNanchor_85:2_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_85:2_378" class="fnanchor">[85:2]</a> where God is said to have commanded the Israelites to
perform this rite, and thereby establish a covenant between him and his
chosen people:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This is my <i>covenant</i> (said the Lord), which ye shall keep,
between me and you and thy seed after thee; every male child
among you shall be circumcised."</p></div>

<p>"We <i>need not doubt</i>," says the Rev. Dr. Giles, "that a <i>Divine command</i>
was given to Abraham that all his posterity should practice the rite of
circumcision."<a name="FNanchor_85:3_379" id="FNanchor_85:3_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_85:3_379" class="fnanchor">[85:3]</a></p>

<p>Such may be the case. If we believe that the Lord of the Universe
communes with man, we <i>need not doubt</i> this; yet, we are compelled to
admit that nations other than the Hebrews practiced this rite. The
origin of it, however, as practiced among other nations, has never been
clearly ascertained. It has been maintained by some scholars that this
rite drew its origin from considerations of health and cleanliness,
which seems very probable, although doubted by many.<a name="FNanchor_85:4_380" id="FNanchor_85:4_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_85:4_380" class="fnanchor">[85:4]</a> Whatever may
have been its origin, it is certain that it was practiced by many of the
ancient Eastern nations, who never came in contact with the Hebrews, in
early times, and, therefore, could not have learned it from them.</p>

<p>The <i>Egyptians</i> practiced circumcision at a very early period,<a name="FNanchor_85:5_381" id="FNanchor_85:5_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_85:5_381" class="fnanchor">[85:5]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>at
least as early as the <i>fourth</i> dynasty&mdash;pyramid one&mdash;and therefore, long
before the time assigned for Joseph's entry into Egypt, from whom some
writers have claimed the Egyptians learned it.<a name="FNanchor_86:1_382" id="FNanchor_86:1_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_86:1_382" class="fnanchor">[86:1]</a></p>

<p>In the decorative pictures of Egyptian tombs, one frequently meets with
persons on whom the denudation of the prepuce is manifested.<a name="FNanchor_86:2_383" id="FNanchor_86:2_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_86:2_383" class="fnanchor">[86:2]</a></p>

<p>On a stone found at Thebes, there is a representation of the
circumcision of Ramses II. A mother is seen holding her boy's arms back,
while the operator kneels in front.<a name="FNanchor_86:3_384" id="FNanchor_86:3_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_86:3_384" class="fnanchor">[86:3]</a> All Egyptian priests were
obliged to be circumcised,<a name="FNanchor_86:4_385" id="FNanchor_86:4_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_86:4_385" class="fnanchor">[86:4]</a> and Pythagoras had to submit to it
before being admitted to the Egyptian sacerdotal mysteries.<a name="FNanchor_86:5_386" id="FNanchor_86:5_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_86:5_386" class="fnanchor">[86:5]</a></p>

<p>Herodotus, the Greek historian, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As this practice can be traced both in Egypt and Ethiopia, to
the remotest antiquity, it is not possible to say which first
introduced it. The Phenicians and Syrians of Palestine
acknowledge that they borrowed it from Egypt."<a name="FNanchor_86:6_387" id="FNanchor_86:6_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_86:6_387" class="fnanchor">[86:6]</a></p></div>

<p>It has been recognized among the <i>Kaffirs</i> and other tribes of
<i>Africa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_86:7_388" id="FNanchor_86:7_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_86:7_388" class="fnanchor">[86:7]</a> It was practiced among the <i>Fijians</i> and <i>Samoans of
Polynesia</i>, and some races of <i>Australia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_86:8_389" id="FNanchor_86:8_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_86:8_389" class="fnanchor">[86:8]</a> The <i>Suzees</i> and the
<i>Mandingoes</i> circumcise their women.<a name="FNanchor_86:9_390" id="FNanchor_86:9_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_86:9_390" class="fnanchor">[86:9]</a> The <i>Assyrians</i>, <i>Colchins</i>,
<i>Phenicians</i>, and others, practiced it.<a name="FNanchor_86:10_391" id="FNanchor_86:10_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_86:10_391" class="fnanchor">[86:10]</a> It has been from time
immemorial a custom among the <i>Abyssinians</i>, though, at the present
time, Christians.<a name="FNanchor_86:11_392" id="FNanchor_86:11_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_86:11_392" class="fnanchor">[86:11]</a></p>

<p>The antiquity of the custom may be assured from the fact of the <i>New
Hollanders</i>, (never known to civilized nations until a few years ago)
having practiced it.<a name="FNanchor_86:12_393" id="FNanchor_86:12_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_86:12_393" class="fnanchor">[86:12]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Troglodytes</i> on the shore of the Red Sea, the <i>Idumeans</i>,
<i>Ammonites</i>, <i>Moabites</i> and <i>Ishmaelites</i>, had the practice of
circumcision.<a href="#Footnote_86:11_392" class="fnanchor">[86:11]</a></p>

<p>The <i>ancient Mexicans</i> also practiced this rite.<a name="FNanchor_86:13_394" id="FNanchor_86:13_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_86:13_394" class="fnanchor">[86:13]</a> It was also
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>found among the <i>Amazon</i> tribes of <i>South America</i>.<a name="FNanchor_87:1_395" id="FNanchor_87:1_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_87:1_395" class="fnanchor">[87:1]</a> These
Indians, as well as some African tribes, were in the habit of
circumcising their women. Among the <i>Campas</i>, the women circumcised
themselves, and a man would not marry a woman who was not
circumcised.<a name="FNanchor_87:2_396" id="FNanchor_87:2_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_87:2_396" class="fnanchor">[87:2]</a> They performed this singular rite upon arriving at
the age of puberty.<a name="FNanchor_87:3_397" id="FNanchor_87:3_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_87:3_397" class="fnanchor">[87:3]</a></p>

<p>Jesus of Nazareth was circumcised,<a name="FNanchor_87:4_398" id="FNanchor_87:4_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_87:4_398" class="fnanchor">[87:4]</a> and had he been really the
founder of the Christian religion, so-called, it would certainly be
incumbent on all Christians to be circumcised as he was, and to observe
that Jewish law which he observed, and which he was so far from
abrogating, that he declared: "heaven and earth shall pass away" ere
"one jot or one tittle" of that law should be dispensed with.<a name="FNanchor_87:5_399" id="FNanchor_87:5_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_87:5_399" class="fnanchor">[87:5]</a> But
the Christians are not followers of the religion of Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_87:6_400" id="FNanchor_87:6_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_87:6_400" class="fnanchor">[87:6]</a> They
are followers of the religion of the <i>Pagans</i>. This, we believe, we
shall be able to show in Part Second of this work.</p>

290, 295) that the sacrificing of a part of the body as a religious
offering to their deity, was, and is a common practice among savage
tribes. Circumcision may have originated in this way. And Mr. Wake,
speaking of it, says: "The <i>origin</i> of this custom has not yet, so far
as I am aware, been satisfactorily explained. The idea that, under
certain climatic conditions, circumcision is necessary for cleanliness
and comfort, does not appear to be well founded, as the custom is not
universal even within the tropics." (Phallism in Ancient Religs., p.
36.)</p></div>

<p>"At the time of the conquest, the Spaniards found circumcised nations in
Central America, and on the Amazon, the Tecuna and Manaos tribes still
observe this practice. In the South Seas it has been met with among
three different races, but it is performed in a somewhat different
manner. On the Australian continent, not all, but the majority of
tribes, practiced circumcision. Among the Papuans, the inhabitants of
New Caledonia and the New Hebrides adhere to this custom. In his third
voyage, Captain Cook found it among the inhabitants of the Friendly
Islands, in particular at Tongataboo, and the younger Pritchard bears
witness to its practice in the Samoa or Fiji groups." (Oscar Peschel:

<h3>CONCLUSION OF PART FIRST.</h3>

<p>There are many other legends recorded in the Old Testament which might
be treated at length, but, as we have considered the principal and most
important, and as we have so much to examine in Part Second, which
treats of the New Testament, we shall take but a passing glance at a few
others.</p>

<p>In Genesis xli. is to be found the story of</p>

<p class="sectctr">PHARAOH'S TWO DREAMS,</p>

<p>which is to the effect that Pharaoh dreamed that he stood by a river,
and saw come up out of it <i>seven</i> fat kine, and <i>seven</i> lean kine, which
devoured the fat ones. He then dreamed that he saw <i>seven</i> good ears of
corn, on one stalk, spring up out of the ground. This was followed by
<i>seven</i> poor ears, which sprang up after them, and devoured the good
ears.</p>

<p>Pharaoh, upon awaking from his sleep, and recalling the dreams which he
dreamed, was greatly troubled, "and he sent and called for all the
magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof, and Pharaoh told them
his dreams, but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh."
Finally, his chief butler tells him of one Joseph, who was skilled in
interpreting dreams, and Pharaoh orders him to be brought before his
presence. He then repeats his dreams to Joseph, who immediately
interprets them to the great satisfaction of the king.</p>

<p>A very similar story is related in the Buddhist <i>Fo-pen-hing</i>&mdash;one of
their sacred books, which has been translated by Prof. Samuel
Beal&mdash;which, in substance, is as follows:</p>

<p>Suddh&ocirc;dana Raja dreamed <i>seven</i> different dreams in one night, when,
"awaking from his sleep, and recalling the visions he had seen, was
greatly troubled, so that the very hair on his body stood erect, and his
limbs trembled." He forthwith summoned to his side, within his palace,
all the great ministers of his council, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>exhorted them in these
words: "Most honorable Sirs! be it known to you that during the present
night I have seen in my dreams strange and potent visions&mdash;there were
<i>seven</i> distinct dreams, which I will now recite (he recites the
dreams). I pray you, honorable Sirs! let not these dreams escape your
memories, but in the morning, when I am seated in my palace, and
surrounded by my attendants, let them be brought to my mind (that they
may be interpreted.)"</p>

<p>At morning light, the king, seated in the midst of his attendants,
issued his commands to all the Brahmans, interpreters of dreams, within
his kingdom, in these terms, "All ye men of wisdom, explain for me by
interpretation the meaning of the dreams I have dreamed in my sleep."</p>

<p>Then all the wise Brahmans, interpreters of dreams, began to consider,
each one in his own heart, what the meaning of these visions could be;
till at last they addressed the king, and said: "Mah&acirc;-raja! be it known
to you that we never before have heard such dreams as these, <i>and we
cannot interpret their meaning</i>."</p>

<p>On hearing this, Suddh&ocirc;dana was very troubled in his heart, and
exceeding distressed. He thought within himself: "Who is there that can
satisfy these doubts of mine?"</p>

<p>Finally a "holy one," called <i>T'so-Ping</i>, being present in the inner
palace, and perceiving the sorrow and distress of the king, assumed the
appearance of a Brahman, and under this form he stood at the gate of the
king's palace, and cried out, saying: "I am able fully to interpret the
dreams of Suddh&ocirc;dana R&acirc;ja, and with certainty to satisfy all the
doubts."</p>

<p>The king ordered him to be brought before his presence, and then related
to him his dreams. Upon hearing them, <i>T'so-Ping</i> immediately
interpreted them, to the great satisfaction of the king.<a name="FNanchor_89:1_401" id="FNanchor_89:1_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_89:1_401" class="fnanchor">[89:1]</a></p>

<p>In the second chapter of Exodus we read of</p>

<p class="sectctr">MOSES THROWN INTO THE NILE,</p>

<p>which is done <i>by command of the king</i>.</p>

<p>There are many counterparts to this in ancient mythology; among them may
be mentioned that of the infant Perseus, who was, <i>by command of the
king</i> (Acrisius of Argos), shut up in a chest, and cast into the sea. He
was found by one Dictys, who took great care of the child, and&mdash;as
<ins class="corr" title="original has Pharoah's">Pharaoh's</ins> daughter did with the child Moses&mdash;educated him.<a name="FNanchor_89:2_402" id="FNanchor_89:2_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_89:2_402" class="fnanchor">[89:2]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p><p>The infant Bacchus was confined in a chest, <i>by order of Cadmus, King
of Thebes</i>, and thrown into the Nile.<a name="FNanchor_90:1_403" id="FNanchor_90:1_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_90:1_403" class="fnanchor">[90:1]</a> He, like Moses, had two
mothers, one by nature, the other by adoption.<a name="FNanchor_90:2_404" id="FNanchor_90:2_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_90:2_404" class="fnanchor">[90:2]</a> He was also, like
Moses, represented <i>horned</i>.<a name="FNanchor_90:3_405" id="FNanchor_90:3_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_90:3_405" class="fnanchor">[90:3]</a></p>

<p>Osiris was also confined in a chest, and thrown into the river
Nile.<a name="FNanchor_90:4_406" id="FNanchor_90:4_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_90:4_406" class="fnanchor">[90:4]</a></p>

<p>When Osiris was shut into the coffer, and cast into the river, he
floated to Phenicia, and was there received under the name of Adonis.
Isis (his mother, or wife) wandered in quest of him, came to Byblos, and
seated herself by a fountain in silence and tears. She was then taken by
the servants of the royal palace, and made to attend on the young prince
of the land. In like manner, Demeter, after Aidoneus had ravished her
daughter, went in pursuit, reached Eleusis, seated herself by a well,
conversed with the daughters of the queen, and became <i>nurse to her
son</i>.<a name="FNanchor_90:5_407" id="FNanchor_90:5_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_90:5_407" class="fnanchor">[90:5]</a> So likewise, when Moses was put into the ark made of
bulrushes, and cast into the Nile, he was found by the daughters of
Pharaoh, and his own mother became his nurse.<a name="FNanchor_90:6_408" id="FNanchor_90:6_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_90:6_408" class="fnanchor">[90:6]</a> This is simply
another version of the same myth.</p>

<p>In the second chapter of the second book of Kings, we read of</p>

<p class="sectctr">ELIJAH ASCENDING TO HEAVEN.</p>

<p>There are many counterparts to this, in heathen mythology.</p>

<p>Hindoo sacred writings relate many such stories&mdash;how some of their Holy
Ones were taken up alive into heaven&mdash;and impressions on rocks are
shown, said to be foot-prints, made when they ascended.<a name="FNanchor_90:7_409" id="FNanchor_90:7_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_90:7_409" class="fnanchor">[90:7]</a></p>

<p>According to Babylonian mythology, <i>Xisuthrus</i> was translated to
heaven.<a name="FNanchor_90:8_410" id="FNanchor_90:8_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_90:8_410" class="fnanchor">[90:8]</a></p>

<p>The story of Elijah ascending to heaven in a chariot of fire may also be
compared to the fiery, flame-red chariot of <i>Ushas</i>.<a name="FNanchor_90:9_411" id="FNanchor_90:9_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_90:9_411" class="fnanchor">[90:9]</a> This idea of
some Holy One ascending to heaven without dying was found in the ancient
mythology of the <i>Chinese</i>.<a name="FNanchor_90:10_412" id="FNanchor_90:10_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_90:10_412" class="fnanchor">[90:10]</a></p>

<p>The story of</p>

<p class="sectctr">DAVID KILLING GOLIATH,</p>

<p>by throwing a stone and hitting him in the forehead,<a name="FNanchor_90:11_413" id="FNanchor_90:11_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_90:11_413" class="fnanchor">[90:11]</a> may be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>compared to the story of <i>Thor</i>, the Scandinavian hero, throwing a
hammer at Hrungnir, and striking him in the forehead.<a name="FNanchor_91:1_414" id="FNanchor_91:1_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_91:1_414" class="fnanchor">[91:1]</a></p>

<p>We read in Numbers<a name="FNanchor_91:2_415" id="FNanchor_91:2_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_91:2_415" class="fnanchor">[91:2]</a> that</p>

<p class="sectctr">BALAAM'S ASS SPOKE</p>

<p>to his master, and reproved him.</p>

<p>In ancient fables or stories in which animals play prominent parts, each
creature is endowed with the power of speech. This idea was common in
the whole of Western Asia and Egypt. It is found in various Egyptian and
Chaldean stories.<a name="FNanchor_91:3_416" id="FNanchor_91:3_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_91:3_416" class="fnanchor">[91:3]</a> Homer has recorded that the <i>horse</i> of Achilles
spoke to him.<a name="FNanchor_91:4_417" id="FNanchor_91:4_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_91:4_417" class="fnanchor">[91:4]</a></p>

<p>We have also a very wonderful story in that of</p>

<p class="sectctr">JOSHUA'S COMMAND TO THE SUN.</p>

<p>This story is related in the tenth chapter of the book of Joshua, and is
to the effect that the Israelites, who were at battle with the Amorites,
wished the day to be lengthened that they might continue their
slaughter, whereupon Joshua said: "Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon,
and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. <i>And the sun stood still</i>, and
the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their
enemies.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And there was no day like that before it or after it."</p>

<p>There are many stories similar to this, to be found among other nations
of antiquity. We have, as an example, that which is related of Bacchus
in the Orphic hymns, wherein it says that this god-man arrested the
course of the sun and the moon.<a name="FNanchor_91:5_418" id="FNanchor_91:5_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_91:5_418" class="fnanchor">[91:5]</a></p>

<p>An Indian legend relates that the sun stood still to hear the pious
ejaculations of Arjouan after the death of Crishna.<a name="FNanchor_91:6_419" id="FNanchor_91:6_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_91:6_419" class="fnanchor">[91:6]</a></p>

<p>A holy Buddhist by the name of M&acirc;tanga prevented the sun, at his
command, from rising, and bisected the moon.<a name="FNanchor_91:7_420" id="FNanchor_91:7_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_91:7_420" class="fnanchor">[91:7]</a> Arresting the course
of the sun was a common thing among the disciples of Buddha.<a name="FNanchor_91:8_421" id="FNanchor_91:8_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_91:8_421" class="fnanchor">[91:8]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Chinese</i> also, had a legend of the sun standing still,<a name="FNanchor_91:9_422" id="FNanchor_91:9_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_91:9_422" class="fnanchor">[91:9]</a> and a
legend was found among the <i>Ancient Mexicans</i> to the effect that one of
their holy persons commanded the sun to stand still, which command was
obeyed.<a name="FNanchor_91:10_423" id="FNanchor_91:10_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_91:10_423" class="fnanchor">[91:10]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p><p>We shall now endeavor to answer the question which must naturally arise
in the minds of all who see, for the first time, the similarity in the
legends of the Hebrews and those of other nations, namely: have the
Hebrews copied from other nations, or, have other nations copied from
the Hebrews? To answer this question we shall; <i>first</i>, give a brief
account or history of the Pentateuch and other books of the Old
Testament from which we have taken legends, and show about what time
they were written; and, <i>second</i>, show that other nations were possessed
of these legends long before that time, <i>and that the Jews copied from
them</i>.</p>

<p>The Pentateuch is ascribed, in our <i>modern</i> translations, to <i>Moses</i>,
and he is generally supposed to be the author. This is altogether
erroneous, as Moses had <i>nothing whatever</i> to do with these five books.
Bishop Colenso, speaking of this, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The books of the Pentateuch <i>are never ascribed to Moses in
the inscriptions of Hebrew manuscripts, or in printed copies
of the Hebrew Bible</i>. Nor are they styled the '<i>Books of
Moses</i>' in the Septuagint<a name="FNanchor_92:1_424" id="FNanchor_92:1_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_92:1_424" class="fnanchor">[92:1]</a> or Vulgate,<a name="FNanchor_92:2_425" id="FNanchor_92:2_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_92:2_425" class="fnanchor">[92:2]</a> <i>but only in
our modern translations</i>, after the example of many eminent
Fathers of the Church, who, with the exception of Jerome, and,
perhaps, Origen, were, one and all of them, very little
acquainted with the Hebrew language, and still less with its
criticism."<a name="FNanchor_92:3_426" id="FNanchor_92:3_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_92:3_426" class="fnanchor">[92:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The author of "The Religion of Israel," referring to this subject, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Jews who lived <i>after</i> the Babylonish Captivity, and the
Christians following their examples, ascribed these books (the
Pentateuch) to Moses; and for many centuries the <i>notion</i> was
cherished that he had really written them. <i>But strict and
impartial investigation has shown that this opinion must be
given up</i>; and that <i>nothing</i> in the whole Law really comes
from Moses himself except the Ten Commandments. <i>And even
these were not delivered by him in the same form as we find
them now.</i> If we still call these books by his name, it is
only because the Israelites always thought of him as their
first and greatest law-giver, <i>and the actual authors grouped
all their narratives and laws around his figure, and
associated them with his name</i>."<a name="FNanchor_92:4_427" id="FNanchor_92:4_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_92:4_427" class="fnanchor">[92:4]</a></p></div>

<p>As we cannot go into an extended account, and show <i>how this is known</i>,
we will simply say that it is principally by <i>internal</i> evidence that
these facts are ascertained.<a name="FNanchor_92:5_428" id="FNanchor_92:5_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_92:5_428" class="fnanchor">[92:5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p><p>Now that we have seen that Moses did not write the books of the
Pentateuch, our next endeavor will be to ascertain <i>when</i> they were
written, and <i>by whom</i>.</p>

<p>We can say that they were not written by any <i>one</i> person, nor were they
written <i>at the same time</i>.</p>

<p>We can trace <i>three</i> principal redactions of the Pentateuch, that is to
say, the material was <i>worked over</i>, and <i>re-edited</i>, with
<i>modifications</i> and <i>additions</i>, by <i>different people</i>, at <i>three
distinct epochs</i>.<a name="FNanchor_93:1_429" id="FNanchor_93:1_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_93:1_429" class="fnanchor">[93:1]</a></p>

<p>The two principal writers are generally known as the <i>Jehovistic</i> and
the <i>Elohistic</i>. We have&mdash;in speaking of the "Eden Myth" and the legend
of the "Deluge"&mdash;already alluded to this fact, and have illustrated how
these writers' narratives conflict with each other.</p>

<p>The <i>Jehovistic</i> writer is supposed to have been a prophet, who, it
would seem, was anxious to give Israel a history. He begins at Genesis,
ii. 4, with a <i>short</i> account, of the "<i>Creation</i>," and then he carries
the story on regularly until the Israelites enter Canaan. It is to him
that we are indebted for the <i>charming</i> pictures of the patriarchs. <i>He
took these from other writings, or from the popular legends.</i><a name="FNanchor_93:2_430" id="FNanchor_93:2_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_93:2_430" class="fnanchor">[93:2]</a></p>

<p>About 725 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> the Israelites were conquered by Salmanassar, King of
Assyria, and many of them were carried away captives. <i>Their place was
supplied by Assyrian colonists from Babylon, Persia, and other
places.</i><a name="FNanchor_93:3_431" id="FNanchor_93:3_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_93:3_431" class="fnanchor">[93:3]</a> This fact is of the greatest importance, and should not
be forgotten, as we find that the <i>first</i> of the three writers of the
Pentateuch, spoken of above, <i>wrote about this time</i>, and the Israelites
heard, <i>from the colonists from Babylon, Persia, and other places&mdash;for
the first time&mdash;many of the legends which this writer wove into the
fabulous history which he wrote, especially the accounts of the Creation
and the Deluge</i>.</p>

<p>The Pentateuch remained in this, its <i>first</i> form, until the year 620 <span class="allcapsc">B.
C.</span> Then a certain <i>priest</i> of marked prophetic sympathies wrote a book
of law which has come down to us in Deuteronomy, iv. 44, to xxvi., and
xxviii. Here we find the demands which the <i>Mosaic</i> party at <i>that day</i>
were making thrown into the form of laws. It was by King Josiah that
this book was first introduced and proclaimed as authoritative.<a name="FNanchor_93:4_432" id="FNanchor_93:4_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_93:4_432" class="fnanchor">[93:4]</a> It
was soon afterwards <i>wove into</i> the work of the <i>first</i> Pentateuchian
writer, and at the same time <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>"<i>a few new passages</i>" were added, some of
which related to Joshua, the successor of Moses.<a name="FNanchor_94:1_433" id="FNanchor_94:1_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_94:1_433" class="fnanchor">[94:1]</a></p>

<p>At this period in Israel's history, Jehovah had become almost forgotten,
and "other gods" had taken his place.<a name="FNanchor_94:2_434" id="FNanchor_94:2_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_94:2_434" class="fnanchor">[94:2]</a> The Mosaic party, so
called&mdash;who worshiped Jehovah exclusively&mdash;were in the minority, but
when King Amon&mdash;who was a worshiper of Moloch&mdash;died, and was succeeded
by his son Josiah, a change immediately took place. This young prince,
who was only eight years old at the death of his father, the Mosaic
party succeeded in winning over to their interests. In the year 621 <span class="allcapsc">B.
C.</span>, Josiah, now in the eighteenth year of his reign, began a thorough
reformation which completely answered to the ideas of the Mosaic
party.<a name="FNanchor_94:3_435" id="FNanchor_94:3_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_94:3_435" class="fnanchor">[94:3]</a></p>

<p>It was during this time that the <i>second</i> Pentateuchian writer wrote,
and <i>he</i> makes <i>Moses</i> speak as the law-giver. This writer was probably
Hilkiah, <i>who claimed to have found a book, written by Moses, in the
temple,<a name="FNanchor_94:4_436" id="FNanchor_94:4_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_94:4_436" class="fnanchor">[94:4]</a> although it had only just been drawn up</i>.<a name="FNanchor_94:5_437" id="FNanchor_94:5_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_94:5_437" class="fnanchor">[94:5]</a></p>

<p>The principal objections which <i>were</i> brought against the claims of
Hilkiah, <i>but which are not needed in the present age of inquiry</i>, was
that Shaphan and Josiah read it off, not as if it were an <i>old</i> book,
<i>but as though it had been recently written</i>, when any person who is
acquainted, in the slightest degree, with language, must know that a man
could not read off, at once, <i>a book written eight hundred years
before</i>. The phraseology would necessarily be so altered by time as to
render it comparatively unintelligible.</p>

<p>We must now turn to the <i>third</i> Pentateuchian writer, <i>whose writings
were published 444 <span class="stressed">b. c.</span></i></p>

<p>At that time Ezra (or Ezdras) <i>added</i> to the work of his two
<i>predecessors</i> a series of <i>laws</i> and <i>narratives</i> which had been drawn
up <i>by some of the priests in Babylon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_94:6_438" id="FNanchor_94:6_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_94:6_438" class="fnanchor">[94:6]</a> This "series of laws and
narratives," which was written by "some of the (Israelitish) priests in
Babylon," was called "<i>The Book of Origins</i>" (probably containing the
Babylonian account of the "<i>Origin of Things</i>," or the "<i>Creation</i>").
Ezra brought the book from <i>Babylon</i> to Jerusalem. He made some
modifications in it and constituted it a code of law for Israel,
<i>dove-tailing it into those parts of the Pentateuch which existed
before</i>. A few <i>alterations</i> and <i>additions</i> were <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>subsequently made,
but these are of minor importance, and we may fairly say <i>that Ezra put
the Pentateuch into the form in which we have it</i> (about 444 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>).</p>

<p>These priestly passages are partly occupied with historical matter,
comprising a very free account of things from the creation of the world
to the arrival of Israel in Canaan. Everything is here presented from
the <i>priestly</i> point of view; some events, elsewhere recorded, are
<i>touched up in the priestly spirit, and others are entirely
invented</i>.<a name="FNanchor_95:1_439" id="FNanchor_95:1_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_95:1_439" class="fnanchor">[95:1]</a></p>

<p>It was the belief of the Jews, asserted by the <i>Pirke Aboth</i> (Sayings of
the Fathers), one of the oldest books of the <i>Talmud</i>,<a name="FNanchor_95:2_440" id="FNanchor_95:2_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_95:2_440" class="fnanchor">[95:2]</a> as well as
other Jewish records, that Ezra, acting in accordance with a divine
commission, re-wrote the Old Testament, the manuscripts of which were
said to have been lost in the destruction of the first temple, when
Nebuchadnezzar took Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_95:3_441" id="FNanchor_95:3_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_95:3_441" class="fnanchor">[95:3]</a> This we <i>know</i> could not have been
the case. The fact that Ezra wrote&mdash;adding to, and taking from the
already existing books of the Pentateuch&mdash;was probably the foundation
for this tradition. The account of it is to be found in the Apocryphal
book of Esdras, a book deemed authentic by the Greek Church.</p>

<p>Dr. Knappert, speaking of this, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"For many centuries, both the Christians and the Jews supposed
that Ezra had brought together the sacred writings of his
people, united them in one whole, and introduced them as a
book given by the Spirit of God&mdash;a Holy Scripture.</p>

<p>"The only authority for this supposition was a very modern and
altogether untrustworthy <i>tradition</i>. The historical and
critical studies of our times have been emancipated from the
influence of this tradition, and the most ancient statements
with regard to the subject have been hunted up and compared
together. These statements are, indeed, scanty and incomplete,
and many a detail is still obscure; but the main facts have
been completely ascertained.</p>

<p>"<i>Before the Babylonish captivity, Israel had no sacred
writings.</i> There were certain laws, prophetic writings, and a
few historical books, but no one had ever thought of ascribing
binding and divine authority to these documents.</p>

<p>"<i>Ezra brought the priestly law with him from Babylon,
altering it and amalgamating it with the narratives and laws
already in existence, and thus produced the Pentateuch in
pretty much the same form</i> (though not quite, as we shall
show) <i>as we still have it. These books got the name of the
'Law of Moses,' or simply the 'Law.'</i> Ezra introduced them
into Israel (<span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> 444), and gave them binding authority, <i>and
from that time forward they were considered divine</i>."<a name="FNanchor_95:4_442" id="FNanchor_95:4_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_95:4_442" class="fnanchor">[95:4]</a></p></div>

<p>From the time of Ezra until the year 287 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, when the Pentateuch was
translated into Greek by order of Ptolemy <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>Philadelphus, King of Egypt,
these books evidently underwent some changes. This the writer quoted
above admits, in saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Later still (viz., after the time of Ezra), <i>a few more
changes and additions were made</i>, and so the Pentateuch grew
into its present form."<a name="FNanchor_96:1_443" id="FNanchor_96:1_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_96:1_443" class="fnanchor">[96:1]</a></p></div>

<p>In answer to those who claim that the Pentateuch was written by <i>one</i>
person, Bishop Colenso says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is certainly inconceivable that if the <i>Pentateuch</i> be the
production of <i>one and the same hand throughout</i>, it should
contain <i>such a number of glaring inconsistencies</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No
single author could have been guilty of such absurdities; but
it is quite possible, and what was almost sure to happen in
such a case, that, if the Pentateuch be the work of <i>different
authors</i> in <i>different ages</i>, this fact should betray itself
<i>by the existence of contradictions in the narrative</i>."<a name="FNanchor_96:2_444" id="FNanchor_96:2_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_96:2_444" class="fnanchor">[96:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Having ascertained the origin of the Pentateuch, or first five books of
the Old Testament, it will be unnecessary to refer to the others <i>here</i>,
as we have nothing to do with <i>them</i> in our investigations. Suffice it
to say then, that: "In the earlier period after Ezra, <i>none of the other
books</i> which already existed, enjoyed the same authority as the
Pentateuch."<a name="FNanchor_96:3_445" id="FNanchor_96:3_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_96:3_445" class="fnanchor">[96:3]</a></p>

<p>It is probable<a name="FNanchor_96:4_446" id="FNanchor_96:4_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_96:4_446" class="fnanchor">[96:4]</a> that Nehemiah made a collection of historical and
prophetic books, songs, <i>and letters from Persian kings</i>, not to form a
second collection, but for the purpose of saving them from being lost.
The scribes of Jerusalem, followers of Ezra, who were known as "the men
of the Great Synagogue," <i>were the collectors of the second and third
divisions of the Old Testament</i>. They collected together the historical
and prophetic books, songs, &amp;c., which were then in existence, <i>and
after altering many of them</i>, they were added to the collection of
<i>sacred</i> books. It must not be supposed that any fixed plan was pursued
in this work, <i>or that the idea was entertained from the first, that
these books would one day stand on the same level with the
Pentateuch</i>.<a name="FNanchor_96:5_447" id="FNanchor_96:5_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_96:5_447" class="fnanchor">[96:5]</a></p>

<p>In the course of time, however, many of the Jews began to consider
<i>some</i> of these books as <i>sacred</i>. The Alexandrian Jews adopted books
into the canon which those of Jerusalem did not, <i>and this difference of
opinion lasted for a long time, even till the second century after
Christ. It was not until this time that all the books of the Old
Testament acquired divine authority.</i><a name="FNanchor_96:6_448" id="FNanchor_96:6_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_96:6_448" class="fnanchor">[96:6]</a> It is not known, however,
<i>just when</i> the canon of the Old Testament was closed. <i>The time and
manner in which it was done is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>altogether obscure.</i><a name="FNanchor_97:1_449" id="FNanchor_97:1_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_97:1_449" class="fnanchor">[97:1]</a> Jewish
tradition indicates that the full canonicity of several books was not
free from doubt till the time of the famous Rabbi Akiba,<a name="FNanchor_97:2_450" id="FNanchor_97:2_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_97:2_450" class="fnanchor">[97:2]</a> who
flourished about the beginning of the second century after Christ.<a name="FNanchor_97:3_451" id="FNanchor_97:3_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_97:3_451" class="fnanchor">[97:3]</a></p>

<p>After giving a history of the books of the Old Testament, the author of
"The Religion of Israel," whom we have followed in this investigation,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The great majority of the writers of the Old Testament had no
other source of information about the past history of Israel
than simple <i>tradition</i>. Indeed, it could not have been
otherwise, for in primitive times no one used to record
anything in writing, and the only way of preserving a
knowledge of the past was to hand it down by word of mouth.
The father told the son what his elders had told him, and the
son handed it on to the next generation.</p>

<p>"Not only did the historian of Israel draw from tradition with
perfect freedom, and write down without hesitation anything
they heard and what was current in the mouths of the people,
<i>but they did not shrink from modifying their representation
of the past in any way that they thought would be good and
useful</i>. It is difficult for us to look at things from this
point of view, because our ideas of historical good faith are
so utterly different. When we write history, we know that we
ought to be guided solely by a desire to represent facts
exactly as they really happened. All that we are concerned
with is <i>reality</i>; we want to make the old times live again,
and we take all possible pains not to remodel the past from
the point of view of to-day. All we want to know is what
happened, and how men lived, thought, and worked in those
days. The Israelites had a very different notion of the nature
of historical composition. When a prophet or a priest related
something about bygone times, his object was not to convey
knowledge about those times; on the contrary, he used history
merely as a vehicle for the conveyance of instruction and
exhortation. Not only did he confine his narrative to such
matters as he thought would serve his purpose but he never
hesitated to modify what he knew of the past, <i>and he did not
think twice about touching it up from his own imagination,
simply that it might be more conducive to the end he had in
view and chime in better with his opinions. All the past
became colored through and through with the tinge of his own
mind.</i> Our own notions of honor and good faith would never
permit all this; but we must not measure ancient writers by
our own standard; they considered that they were acting quite
within their rights and in strict accordance with duty and
conscience."<a name="FNanchor_97:4_452" id="FNanchor_97:4_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_97:4_452" class="fnanchor">[97:4]</a></p></div>

<p>It will be noticed that, in our investigations on the authority of the
Pentateuch, we have followed, principally, Dr. Knappert's ideas as set
forth in "The Religion of Israel."</p>

<p>This we have done because we could not go into an extended
investigation, and because his words are very expressive, and just to
the point. To those who may think that his ideas are not the same as
those entertained by other Biblical scholars of the present <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>day, we
subjoin, in a note below, a list of works to which they are
referred.<a name="FNanchor_98:1_453" id="FNanchor_98:1_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_98:1_453" class="fnanchor">[98:1]</a></p>

<p>We shall now, after giving a brief history of the Pentateuch, refer to
the legends of which we have been treating, and endeavor to show from
whence the Hebrews borrowed them. The first of these is "<i>The Creation
and Fall of Man</i>."</p>

<p>Egypt, the country out of which the Israelites came, had no story of the
Creation and Fall of Man, <i>such as we have found among the Hebrews</i>;
they therefore could not have learned it from <i>them</i>. The <i>Chaldeans</i>,
however, as we saw in our first chapter, had this legend, and it is from
them that the Hebrews borrowed it.</p>

<p>The account which we have given of the Chaldean story of the Creation
and Fall of Man, was taken, as we stated, from the writings of Berosus,
the Chaldean historian, who lived in the time of Alexander the Great
(356-325 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>), and as the Jews were acquainted with the story some
centuries earlier than this, his works did not prove that these
traditions were in Babylonia before the Jewish captivity, and could not
afford testimony in favor of the statement that the Jews borrowed this
legend from the Babylonians <i>at that time</i>. It was left for Mr. George
Smith, of the British Museum, to establish, without a doubt, the fact
that this legend was known to the Babylonians at least <i>two thousand
years before the time assigned for the birth of Jesus</i>. The cuneiform
inscriptions discovered by him, while on an expedition to Assyria,
organized by the London "Daily Telegraph," was the means of doing this,
and although by far the greatest number of these tablets belong to the
age of Assurbanipal, who reigned over Assyria <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> 670, it is
"acknowledged on all hands that these tablets are not the originals,
<i>but are only copies from earlier texts</i>." "The Assyrians acknowledge
themselves that this literature was borrowed from Babylonian sources,
and of course it is to Babylonia we have to look to ascertain the
approximate dates of the original documents."<a name="FNanchor_98:2_454" id="FNanchor_98:2_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_98:2_454" class="fnanchor">[98:2]</a> Mr. Smith then
shows, from "fragments of the Cuneiform account of the Creation and
Fall" which have been discovered, that, "<i>in the period from <span class="stressed">b. c.</span> 2000
to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>1500, the Babylonians believed in a story similar to that in
Genesis</i>." It is probable, however, says Mr. Smith, that this legend
existed as <i>traditions</i> in the country <i>long before it was committed to
writing</i>, and some of these traditions exhibited great difference in
details, <i>showing that they had passed through many changes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_99:1_455" id="FNanchor_99:1_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_99:1_455" class="fnanchor">[99:1]</a></p>

<p>Professor James Fergusson, in his celebrated work on "Tree and Serpent
Worship," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The two chapters which refer to this (<i>i. e.</i>, the Garden,
the Tree, and the Serpent), as indeed the whole of the first
eight of Genesis, are now generally admitted by scholars to be
made up of fragments of earlier books or earlier traditions,
belonging, properly speaking, to Mesopotamia rather than to
Jewish history, the exact meaning of which the writers of the
Pentateuch seem hardly to have appreciated when they
transcribed them in the form in which they are now
found."<a name="FNanchor_99:2_456" id="FNanchor_99:2_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_99:2_456" class="fnanchor">[99:2]</a></p></div>

<p>John Fiske says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The story of the Serpent in Eden is an Aryan story in every
particular. The notion of Satan as the author of evil appears
only in the later books, <i>composed after the Jews had come
into close contact with Persian ideas</i>."<a name="FNanchor_99:3_457" id="FNanchor_99:3_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_99:3_457" class="fnanchor">[99:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Prof. John W. Draper says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the old legends of dualism, the evil spirit was said to
have <i>sent a serpent to ruin Paradise</i>. These legends became
known to the Jews <i>during their Babylonian captivity</i>."<a name="FNanchor_99:4_458" id="FNanchor_99:4_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_99:4_458" class="fnanchor">[99:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Professor Goldziher also shows, in his "Mythology Among the
Hebrews,"<a name="FNanchor_99:5_459" id="FNanchor_99:5_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_99:5_459" class="fnanchor">[99:5]</a> that the story of the creation was borrowed by the
Hebrews from the Babylonians. He also informs us that the notion of the
<i>b&ocirc;r&ecirc;</i> and <i>y&ocirc;s&ecirc;r</i>, "Creator" (the term used in the cosmogony in
Genesis) as an integral part of the idea of God, <i>are first brought into
use by the prophets of the captivity</i>. "Thus also the story of the
<i>Garden of Eden</i>, as a supplement to the history of the Creation, <i>was
written down at Babylon</i>."</p>

<p>Strange as it may appear, after the <i>Genesis</i> account, we may pass
through the whole Pentateuch, and other books of the Old Testament,
clear to the end, and will find that the story of the "<i>Garden of Eden</i>"
and "<i>Fall of Man</i>," is hardly alluded to, if at all. Lengkerke says:
"One single <i>certain</i> trace of the employment of the story of Adam's
fall is entirely wanting in the Hebrew Canon (after the Genesis
account). Adam, Eve, the Serpent, the woman's <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>seduction of her husband,
&amp;c., are all images, <i>to which the remaining words of the Israelites
never again recur</i>."<a name="FNanchor_100:1_460" id="FNanchor_100:1_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_100:1_460" class="fnanchor">[100:1]</a></p>

<p>This circumstance can only be explained by the fact that the first
chapters of Genesis were not written until <i>after</i> the other portions
had been written.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice, that this story of the Fall of Man, upon which
the whole orthodox scheme of a divine Saviour or Redeemer is based, was
<i>not</i> considered by the learned Israelites as <i>fact</i>. They simply looked
upon it as a story which satisfied the ignorant, but which should be
considered as <i>allegory</i> by the learned.<a name="FNanchor_100:2_461" id="FNanchor_100:2_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_100:2_461" class="fnanchor">[100:2]</a></p>

<p>Rabbi Maimonides (Moses Ben Maimon), one of the most celebrated of the
Rabbis, says on this subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We must not understand, or take in a literal sense, what is
written in <i>the book</i> on the <i>Creation</i>, nor form of it the
same ideas which are participated by the generality of
mankind; <i>otherwise our ancient sages would not have so much
recommended to us, to hide the real meaning of it, and not to
lift the allegorical veil, which covers the truth contained
therein</i>. When taken in its <i>literal sense</i>, the work gives
the most absurd and most extravagant ideas of the Deity.
'Whosoever should divine its true meaning ought to take great
care in not divulging it.' This is a maxim repeated to us by
all our sages, principally concerning the understanding of the
work of the six days."<a name="FNanchor_100:3_462" id="FNanchor_100:3_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_100:3_462" class="fnanchor">[100:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Philo, a Jewish writer contemporary with Jesus, held the same opinion of
the character of the sacred books of the Hebrews. He has made two
particular treatises, bearing the title of "<i>The Allegories</i>," and he
traces back to the <i>allegorical</i> sense the "Tree of Life," the "Rivers
of Paradise," and the other fictions of the Genesis.<a name="FNanchor_100:4_463" id="FNanchor_100:4_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_100:4_463" class="fnanchor">[100:4]</a></p>

<p>Many of the early Christian Fathers declared that, in the story of the
Creation and Fall of Man, there was but an <i>allegorical fiction</i>. Among
these may be mentioned St. Augustine, who speaks of it in his "City of
God," and also Origen, who says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"What man of sense will agree with the statement that the
first, second, and third days, in which the <i>evening</i> is named
and the <i>morning</i>, were without sun, moon and stars? What man
is found such an idiot as to suppose that God planted trees in
Paradise like an husbandman? <i>I believe that every man must
hold these things for images under which a hidden sense is
concealed.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_100:5_464" id="FNanchor_100:5_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_100:5_464" class="fnanchor">[100:5]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p><p>Origen believed aright, as it is now almost universally admitted, that
the stories of the "Garden of Eden," the "Elysian Fields," the "Garden
of the Blessed," &amp;c., which were the abode of the blessed, where grief
and sorrow could not approach them, where plague and sickness could not
touch them, were founded on <i>allegory</i>. These abodes of delight were far
away in the <i>West</i>, where the sun goes down beyond the bounds of the
earth. They were the "Golden Islands" sailing in a sea of blue&mdash;<i>the
burnished clouds floating in the pure ether</i>. In a word, <i>the "Elysian
Fields" are the clouds at eventide</i>. The picture was suggested by the
images drawn from the phenomena of sunset and twilight.<a name="FNanchor_101:1_465" id="FNanchor_101:1_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_101:1_465" class="fnanchor">[101:1]</a></p>

<p>Eating of the forbidden fruit was simply a figurative mode of expressing
the performance of the act necessary to the perpetuation of the human
race. The "Tree of Knowledge" was a Phallic tree, and the fruit which
grew upon it was Phallic fruit.<a name="FNanchor_101:2_466" id="FNanchor_101:2_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_101:2_466" class="fnanchor">[101:2]</a></p>

<p>In regard to the story of "<i>The Deluge</i>," we have already seen<a name="FNanchor_101:3_467" id="FNanchor_101:3_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_101:3_467" class="fnanchor">[101:3]</a>
that "Egyptian records tell nothing of a cataclysmal deluge," and that,
"the land was <i>never</i> visited by other than its annual beneficent
overflow of the river Nile." Also, that "the Pharaoh Khoufou-cheops was
building his pyramid, according to Egyptian chronicle, when the whole
world was under the waters of a universal deluge, according to the
Hebrew chronicle." This is sufficient evidence that the Hebrews did not
borrow the legend from the Egyptians.</p>

<p>We have also seen, in the chapter that treated of this legend, that it
corresponded in all the principal features with the <i>Chaldean</i> account.
We shall now show that it was taken from this.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith discovered, on the site of Ninevah, during the years 1873-4,
cylinders belonging to the early Babylonian monarchy, (from 2500 to 1500
<span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>) which contained the legend of the flood,<a name="FNanchor_101:4_468" id="FNanchor_101:4_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_101:4_468" class="fnanchor">[101:4]</a> and which we gave
in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II</a>. <i>This was the foundation for the Hebrew legend, and they
learned it at the time of the Captivity.</i><a name="FNanchor_101:5_469" id="FNanchor_101:5_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_101:5_469" class="fnanchor">[101:5]</a> The myth of Deucalion,
the Grecian hero, was also taken from the same source. The Greeks
learned it from the Chaldeans.</p>

<p>We read in Chambers's Encyclop&aelig;dia, that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was at one time extensively believed, even by intelligent
scholars, that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>the myth of Deucalion was a corrupted
tradition of the <i>Noachian</i> deluge, but this <i>untenable</i>
opinion is now all but universally abandoned."<a name="FNanchor_102:1_470" id="FNanchor_102:1_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_102:1_470" class="fnanchor">[102:1]</a></p></div>

<p>This idea was abandoned after it was found that the Deucalion myth was
older than the Hebrew.</p>

<p>What was said in regard to the Eden story not being mentioned in other
portions of the Old Testament save in Genesis, also applies to this
story of the Deluge. <i>Nowhere</i> in the other books of the Old Testament
is found any reference to this story, except in Isaiah, where "the
waters of Noah" are mentioned, and in Ezekiel, where simply the <i>name</i>
of Noah is mentioned.</p>

<p>We stated in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a> that some persons saw in this story an
<i>astronomical</i> myth. Although not generally admitted, yet there are very
strong reasons for believing this to be the case.</p>

<p>According to the <i>Chaldean</i> account&mdash;which is the oldest one
known&mdash;there were <i>seven</i> persons saved in the ark.<a name="FNanchor_102:2_471" id="FNanchor_102:2_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_102:2_471" class="fnanchor">[102:2]</a> There were
also <i>seven</i> persons saved, according to some of the <i>Hindoo</i>
accounts.<a name="FNanchor_102:3_472" id="FNanchor_102:3_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_102:3_472" class="fnanchor">[102:3]</a> That this referred to the sun, moon, and five planets
looks very probable. We have also seen that Noah was the <i>tenth</i>
patriarch, and <ins class="corr" title="original has Xisthrus">Xisuthrus</ins> (who is the Chaldean hero) was the <i>tenth</i>
king.<a name="FNanchor_102:4_473" id="FNanchor_102:4_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_102:4_473" class="fnanchor">[102:4]</a> Now, according to the Babylonian table, their <i>Zodiac</i>
contained <i>ten</i> gods called the "<i>Ten Zodiac</i> gods."<a name="FNanchor_102:5_474" id="FNanchor_102:5_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_102:5_474" class="fnanchor">[102:5]</a> They also
believed that whenever all the <i>planets</i> met in the sign of Capricorn,
<i>the whole earth was overwhelmed with a deluge of water</i>.<a name="FNanchor_102:6_475" id="FNanchor_102:6_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_102:6_475" class="fnanchor">[102:6]</a> The
<i>Hindoos</i> and other nations had a similar belief.<a name="FNanchor_102:7_476" id="FNanchor_102:7_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_102:7_476" class="fnanchor">[102:7]</a></p>

<p>It is well known that the Chaldeans were great astronomers. When
Alexander the Great conquered the city of Babylon, the Chaldean priests
boasted to the Greek philosophers, who followed his army, that they had
continued their astronomical calculations through a period of more than
forty thousand years.<a name="FNanchor_102:8_477" id="FNanchor_102:8_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_102:8_477" class="fnanchor">[102:8]</a> Although this statement cannot be credited,
yet the great antiquity of Chaldea cannot be doubted, and its immediate
connection with Hindostan, or Egypt, is abundantly proved by the little
that is known concerning its religion, and by the few fragments that
remain of its former grandeur.</p>

<p>In regard to the story of "<i>The Tower of Babel</i>" little need be said.
This, as well as the story of the Creation and Fall of Man, and the
Deluge, was borrowed from the Babylonians.<a name="FNanchor_102:9_478" id="FNanchor_102:9_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_102:9_478" class="fnanchor">[102:9]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p><p>"It seems," says George Smith, "from the indications in the (cuneiform)
inscriptions, that there happened in the interval between 2000 and 1850
<span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> a general <i>collection</i> of the development of the various
traditions of the Creation, Flood, Tower of Babel, and other similar
legends." "These legends were, however, traditions before they were
committed to writing, <i>and were common in some form to all the
country</i>."<a name="FNanchor_103:1_479" id="FNanchor_103:1_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_103:1_479" class="fnanchor">[103:1]</a></p>

<p>The Tower of Babel, or the confusion of tongues, is nowhere alluded to
in the Old Testament outside of Genesis, where the story is related.</p>

<p>The next story in order is "<i>The Trial of Abraham's Faith</i>."</p>

<p>In this connection we have shown similar legends taken from <i>Grecian</i>
mythology, which legends may have given <i>the idea</i> to the writer of the
Hebrew story.</p>

<p>It may appear strange that the <i>Hebrews</i> should have been acquainted
with <i>Grecian</i> mythology, yet we know this was the case. The fact is
accounted for in the following manner:</p>

<p>Many of the Jews taken captive at the Edomite sack of Jerusalem were
sold to the <i>Grecians</i>,<a name="FNanchor_103:2_480" id="FNanchor_103:2_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_103:2_480" class="fnanchor">[103:2]</a> who took them to their country. While
there, they became acquainted with Grecian legends, and when they
returned from "the Islands of the Sea"&mdash;as they called the Western
countries&mdash;<i>they brought them to Jerusalem</i>.<a name="FNanchor_103:3_481" id="FNanchor_103:3_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_103:3_481" class="fnanchor">[103:3]</a></p>

<p>This legend, as we stated in the chapter which treated of it, was
written at the time when the Mosaic party in Israel were endeavoring to
abolish human sacrifices and other "abominations," and the author of the
story invented it to make it appear that the Lord had abolished them in
the time of Abraham. The earliest <i>Targum</i><a name="FNanchor_103:4_482" id="FNanchor_103:4_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_103:4_482" class="fnanchor">[103:4]</a> knows nothing about
the legend, showing that the story was not in the Pentateuch at the time
this Targum was written.</p>

<p>We have also seen that a story written by Sanchoniathon (about <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>
1300) of one Saturn, whom the Phenicians called <i>Israel</i>, bore a
resemblance to the Hebrew legend of Abraham. Now, Count de Volney tells
us that "a similar tradition prevailed among the <i>Chaldeans</i>," and that
they had the history of one <i>Zerban</i>&mdash;which means
"rich-in-gold"<a name="FNanchor_103:5_483" id="FNanchor_103:5_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_103:5_483" class="fnanchor">[103:5]</a>&mdash;that corresponded in many respects with the
history of Abraham.<a name="FNanchor_103:6_484" id="FNanchor_103:6_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_103:6_484" class="fnanchor">[103:6]</a> It may, then, have been from the Chaldean
story that the Hebrew fable writer got his idea.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p><p>The next legend which we examined was that of "<i>Jacob's Vision of the
Ladder</i>." We claimed that it probably referred to the doctrine of the
transmigration of souls from one body into another, and also gave the
apparent reason for the invention of the story.</p>

<p>The next story was "<i>The Exodus from Egypt, and Passage through the Red
Sea</i>," in which we showed, from Egyptian history, that the Israelites
were <i>turned out</i> of the country on account of their uncleanness, and
that the wonderful exploits recorded of Moses were simply copies of
legends related of the sun-god Bacchus. These legends came from "the
Islands of the Sea," and came in very handy for the Hebrew fable
writers; they saved them the trouble of <i>inventing</i>.</p>

<p>We now come to the story relating to "<i>The Receiving of the Ten
Commandments</i>" by Moses from the Lord, on the top of a mountain, 'mid
thunders and lightnings.</p>

<p>All that is likely to be historical in this account, is that Moses
assembled, not, indeed, the whole of the people, but the heads of the
tribes, and gave them the code which he had prepared.<a name="FNanchor_104:1_485" id="FNanchor_104:1_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_104:1_485" class="fnanchor">[104:1]</a> The
<i>marvellous</i> portion of the story was evidently copied from that related
of the law-giver Zoroaster, by the <i>Persians</i>, and the idea that there
were <i>two</i> tables of stone with the Law written thereon was evidently
taken from the story of Bacchus, the Law-giver, who had <i>his</i> laws
written on <i>two tables of stone</i>.<a name="FNanchor_104:2_486" id="FNanchor_104:2_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_104:2_486" class="fnanchor">[104:2]</a></p>

<p>The next legend treated was that of "<i>Samson and his Exploits</i>."</p>

<p>Those who, <i>like the learned of the last century</i>, maintain that the
Pagans copied from the Hebrews, may say that Samson was the model of all
their similar stories, but now that our ideas concerning antiquity are
enlarged, and when we know that Hercules is well known to have been the
God <i>Sol</i>, whose <i>allegorical history</i> was spread among many nations
long before the Hebrews were ever heard of, we are authorized to believe
and to say that some Jewish <i>mythologist</i>&mdash;for what else are their
so-called historians&mdash;composed the anecdote of Samson, by partly
disfiguring the popular traditions of the Greeks, Phenicians and
Chaldeans, and claiming that hero for his own nation.<a name="FNanchor_104:3_487" id="FNanchor_104:3_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_104:3_487" class="fnanchor">[104:3]</a></p>

<p>The Babylonian story of Izdubar, the lion-killer, who wandered <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>to <i>the
regions of the blessed</i> (the Grecian Elysium), who crossed <i>a great
waste of land</i> (the desert of <i>Lybia</i>, according to the Grecian mythos),
and arrived at a region <i>where splendid trees were laden with jewels</i>
(the Grecian Garden of the Hesperides), is probably the foundation for
the Hercules and other corresponding myths. This conclusion is drawn
from the fact that, although the story of Hercules was known in the
island of Thasus, by the <i>Phenician</i> colony settled there, <i>five
centuries before he was known in Greece</i>,<a name="FNanchor_105:1_488" id="FNanchor_105:1_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_105:1_488" class="fnanchor">[105:1]</a> yet <i>its antiquity
among the Babylonians antedates that</i>.</p>

<p>The age of the legends of Izdubar among the Babylonians cannot be placed
with certainty, yet, the cuneiform inscriptions relating to this hero,
which have been found, may be placed at about 2000 years <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span><a name="FNanchor_105:2_489" id="FNanchor_105:2_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_105:2_489" class="fnanchor">[105:2]</a>
"As these stories were <i>traditions</i>," says Mr. Smith, the discoverer of
the cylinders, "before they were committed to writing, their antiquity
as tradition is probably much greater than that."<a name="FNanchor_105:3_490" id="FNanchor_105:3_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_105:3_490" class="fnanchor">[105:3]</a></p>

<p>With these legends before them, the Jewish priests in Babylon had no
difficulty in arranging the story of Samson, and adding it to their
already fabulous history.</p>

<p>As the Rev. Dr. Isaac M. Wise remarks, in speaking of the ancient
Hebrews: "They adopted forms, terms, ideas and myths of all nations with
whom they came in contact, and, like the Greeks, in their way, <i>cast
them all in a peculiar Jewish religious mold</i>."</p>

<p>We have seen, in the chapter which treats of this legend, that it is
recorded in the book of Judges. <i>This book was not written till after
the first set of Israelites had been carried into captivity, and perhaps
still later.</i><a name="FNanchor_105:4_491" id="FNanchor_105:4_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_105:4_491" class="fnanchor">[105:4]</a></p>

<p>After this we have "<i>Jonah swallowed by a Big Fish</i>," which is the last
legend treated.</p>

<p>We saw that it was a <i>solar myth</i>, known to many nations of antiquity.
The writer of the book&mdash;whoever he may have been&mdash;<i>lived in the fifth
century before Christ</i>&mdash;after the Jews had become acquainted and had
mixed with other nations. The writer of this wholly fictitious story,
taking the prophet Jonah&mdash;who was evidently an historical personage&mdash;for
his hero, was perhaps intending to show the loving-kindness of
Jehovah.<a name="FNanchor_105:5_492" id="FNanchor_105:5_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_105:5_492" class="fnanchor">[105:5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p><p>We have now examined all the <i>principal</i> Old Testament legends, and,
after what has been seen, we think that no <i>impartial</i> person can still
consider them <i>historical facts</i>. That so great a number of educated
persons still do so seems astonishing, in our way of thinking. They have
repudiated Greek and Roman mythology with disdain; why then admit with
respect the mythology of the Jews? Ought the miracles of Jehovah to
impress us more than those of Jupiter? We think not; they should all be
looked upon as <i>relics of the past</i>.</p>

<p>That Christian writers are beginning to be aroused to the idea that
another tack should be taken, differing from the old, is very evident.
This is clearly seen by the words of Prof. Richard A. Armstrong, the
translator of Dr. Knappert's "Religion of Israel" into English. In the
<i>Preface</i> of this work, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It appears to me to be profoundly important that the youthful
English mind should be faithfully and accurately informed of
the results of modern research into the early development of
the Israelitish religion. Deplorable and irreparable mischief
will be done to the generation, now passing into manhood and
womanhood, if their educators leave them ignorant or loosely
informed on these topics; for they will then be rudely
awakened by the enemies of Christianity from a blind and
unreasoning faith in the supernatural inspiration of the
Scriptures; and being suddenly and bluntly made aware that
Abraham, Moses, David, and the rest did not say, do, or write
what has been ascribed to them, they will fling away all care
for the venerable religion of Israel and all hope that it can
nourish their own religious life. How much happier will those
of our children and young people be who learn what is now
known of the actual origin of the Pentateuch and the Writings,
from the same lips which have taught them that the Prophets
indeed prepared the way for Jesus, and that God is indeed our
Heavenly Father. For these will, without difficulty, perceive
that God's love is none the feebler and that the Bible is no
less precious, because Moses knew nothing of the Levitical
legislation, or because it was not the warrior monarch on his
semi-barbaric throne, but some far later son of Israel, who
breathed forth the immortal hymn of faith, 'The Lord is my
Shepherd; I shall not want.'"</p></div>

<p>For the benefit of those who may think that the evidence of plagiarism
on the part of the Hebrew writers has not been sufficiently
substantiated, we will quote a few words from Prof. Max M&uuml;ller, who is
one of the best English authorities on this subject that can be
produced. In speaking of this he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The opinion that the <i>Pagan</i> religions were mere corruptions
of the religion of the Old Testament, once supported by men of
high authority and great learning, <i>is now as completely
surrendered as the attempts of explaining Greek and Latin as
the corruptions of Hebrew</i>."<a name="FNanchor_106:1_493" id="FNanchor_106:1_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_106:1_493" class="fnanchor">[106:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Again he says:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"As soon as the ancient language and religion of India became
known in Europe it was asserted that Sanskrit, <i>like all other
languages</i>, was to be derived from Hebrew, and the ancient
religion of the Brahmans from the Old Testament. There was at
that time an enthusiasm among Oriental scholars, particularly
at Calcutta, and an interest for Oriental antiquities in the
public at large, of which we, in these days of apathy for
Eastern literature, can hardly form an adequate idea.
Everybody wished to be first in the field, and to bring to
light some of the treasures which were supposed to be hidden
in the sacred literature of the Brahmans.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No doubt the
temptation was great. No one could look down for a moment into
the rich mine of religious and mythological lore that was
suddenly opened before the eyes of scholars and theologians,
<i>without being struck by a host of similarities, not only in
the languages, but also in the ancient traditions of the
Hindoos</i>, the Greeks, and the Romans; and if at that time the
Greeks and Romans were still <i>supposed</i> to have borrowed their
language and their religion from Jewish quarters, <i>the same
conclusion could hardly be avoided with regard to the language
and the religion of the Brahmans of India</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="original has single quote">"</ins>The student of Pagan religion as well as Christian
missionaries were bent on discovering more striking and more
startling coincidences, <i>in order to use them in confirmation
of their favorite theory that some rays of a primeval
revelation, or some reflection of the Jewish religion, had
reached the uttermost ends of the world</i>."<a name="FNanchor_107:1_494" id="FNanchor_107:1_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_107:1_494" class="fnanchor">[107:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The result of all this is summed up by Prof. M&uuml;ller as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>It was the fate of all (these) pioneers, not only to be left
behind in the assault which they had planned, but to find that
many of their approaches were made in a false direction, and
had to be abandoned.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_107:2_495" id="FNanchor_107:2_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_107:2_495" class="fnanchor">[107:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Before closing this chapter, we shall say a few words on the religion of
Israel. It is supposed by many&mdash;in fact, we have heard it asserted by
those who should know better&mdash;that the Israelites were always
<i>monotheists</i>, that they worshiped One God only&mdash;<i>Jehovah</i>.<a name="FNanchor_107:3_496" id="FNanchor_107:3_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_107:3_496" class="fnanchor">[107:3]</a> This
is altogether erroneous; they were not different from their
neighbors&mdash;the Heathen, so-called&mdash;in regard to their religion.</p>

<p>In the first place, we know that they revered and worshiped a <i>Bull</i>,
called <i>Apis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_107:4_497" id="FNanchor_107:4_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_107:4_497" class="fnanchor">[107:4]</a> just as the ancient Egyptians did. They <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>worshiped
the <i>sun</i>,<a name="FNanchor_108:1_498" id="FNanchor_108:1_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:1_498" class="fnanchor">[108:1]</a> the <i>moon</i>,<a name="FNanchor_108:2_499" id="FNanchor_108:2_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:2_499" class="fnanchor">[108:2]</a> the <i>stars</i> and all the host of

<p>They worshiped <i>fire</i>, and kept it burning on an altar, just as the
Persians and other nations.<a name="FNanchor_108:4_501" id="FNanchor_108:4_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:4_501" class="fnanchor">[108:4]</a> They worshiped <i>stones</i>,<a name="FNanchor_108:5_502" id="FNanchor_108:5_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:5_502" class="fnanchor">[108:5]</a>
revered an <i>oak tree</i>,<a name="FNanchor_108:6_503" id="FNanchor_108:6_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:6_503" class="fnanchor">[108:6]</a> and "bowed down" to <i>images</i>.<a name="FNanchor_108:7_504" id="FNanchor_108:7_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:7_504" class="fnanchor">[108:7]</a> They
worshiped a "Queen of Heaven" called the goddess <i>Astarte</i> or <i>Mylitta</i>,
and "burned incense" to her.<a name="FNanchor_108:8_505" id="FNanchor_108:8_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:8_505" class="fnanchor">[108:8]</a> They worshiped <i>Baal</i>,<a name="FNanchor_108:9_506" id="FNanchor_108:9_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:9_506" class="fnanchor">[108:9]</a>

<p>It was during the Captivity that idolatry ceased among the
Israelites.<a name="FNanchor_108:14_511" id="FNanchor_108:14_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:14_511" class="fnanchor">[108:14]</a> The Babylonian Captivity is clearly referred to in
the book of Deuteronomy, as the close of Israel's idolatry.<a name="FNanchor_108:15_512" id="FNanchor_108:15_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:15_512" class="fnanchor">[108:15]</a></p>

<p>There is reason to believe that the real genius of the people was first
called into full exercise, and put on its career of development at this
time; that Babylon was a <i>forcing nursery</i>, not a prison cell; <i>creating
instead of stifling a nation</i>. The astonishing outburst of intellectual
and moral energy that accompanied the return from the Babylonish
Captivity, attests the spiritual activity of that "mysterious and
momentous" time. As Prof. Goldziher says: "The intellect of <i>Babylon</i>
and <i>Assyria</i> exerted a more than passing influence on that of the
<i>Hebrews</i>, not merely touching it, but <i>entering deep into it</i>, and
<i>leaving its own impression upon it</i>."<a name="FNanchor_108:16_513" id="FNanchor_108:16_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:16_513" class="fnanchor">[108:16]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p><p>This impression we have already partly seen in the legends which they
borrowed, and it may also be seen in the religious ideas which they
imbibed.</p>

<p>The Assyrian colonies which came and occupied the land of the tribes of
Israel filled the kingdom of Samaria with the dogma of the <i>Magi</i>, which
very soon penetrated into the kingdom of Judah. Afterward, Jerusalem
being subjugated, the defenseless country was entered by persons of
different nationalities, who introduced their opinions, and in this way,
the religion of Israel was doubly mutilated. Besides, the priests and
great men, who were transported to Babylon, were educated in the
sciences of the Chaldeans, and imbibed, during a residence of fifty
years, nearly the whole of their theology. It was not until this time
that the dogmas of the hostile genius (Satan), the angels Michael,
Uriel, Yar, Nisan, &amp;c., the rebel angels, the battle in heaven, the
immortality of the soul, and the resurrection, were introduced and
naturalized among the Jews.<a name="FNanchor_109:1_514" id="FNanchor_109:1_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_109:1_514" class="fnanchor">[109:1]</a></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Note_p109" id="Note_p109"></a>Note.</span>&mdash;It is not generally known that the Jews were removed from their
own land until the time of the Babylonian Nebuchadnezzar, but there is
evidence that Jerusalem was plundered by the <i>Edomites</i> about 800 B. C.,
who sold some of the captive Jews to the Greeks (Joel<ins class="corr" title="original has period">,</ins> iii. 6). When the
captives returned to their country from "the Islands which are beyond
the sea" (Jer. xxv. 18, 22), they would naturally bring back with them
much of the Hellenic lore of their conquerors. In Isaiah (xi. 11), we
find a reference to this first captivity in the following words: "In
that day the Lord shall set his hand again the <i>second time</i> to recover
the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from
Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar,
and from Hamath, and from the <i>Islands of the sea</i>;" i. e., <span class="smcap">Greece</span>.</p>

selected by the Almighty to preserve and carry down to later ages a
knowledge of the <i>One</i> and true God&mdash;that the Patriarchs possessed this
knowledge&mdash;that Moses delivered and enforced this doctrine as the
fundamental tenet of the national creed; and that it was, in fact, the
received and distinctive dogma of the Hebrew people. This <i>alleged
possession of the true faith</i> by one only people, while all surrounding
tribes were lost in Polytheism, or something worse, has been adduced by
divines in general as a proof of the truth of the sacred history, and of
the divine origin of the Mosaic dispensation." (Greg: The Creed of

<h3>THE NEW TESTAMENT.</h3>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>THE MIRACULOUS BIRTH OF CHRIST JESUS.</h3>

<p>According to the dogma of the deity of Jesus, he who is said to have
lived on earth some eighteen centuries ago, as <i>Jesus of Nazareth</i>, is
second of the three persons in the Trinity, the <span class="smcap">Son</span>, God as absolutely
as the Father and the Holy Spirit, except as eternally deriving his
existence from the Father. What, however, especially characterizes the
Son, and distinguishes him from the two other persons united with him in
the unity of the Deity, is this, that the Son, at a given moment of
time, became incarnate, and that, without losing anything of his divine
nature, he thus became possessed of a complete human nature; so that he
is at the same time, without injury to the unity of his person, "<i>truly
man and truly God</i>."</p>

<p>The story of the miraculous birth of Jesus is told by the <i>Matthew</i>
narrator as follows:<a name="FNanchor_111:1_515" id="FNanchor_111:1_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_111:1_515" class="fnanchor">[111:1]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together,
she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph, her
husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a
public example, was minded to put her away privily. But while
he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord
appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of
David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that
which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall
bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he
shall save his people from their sins. Now all this was done,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the
prophet, saying: Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and
shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name
Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us."<a name="FNanchor_111:2_516" id="FNanchor_111:2_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_111:2_516" class="fnanchor">[111:2]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p><p>A Deliverer was hoped for, expected, prophesied, in the time of Jewish
misery<a name="FNanchor_112:1_517" id="FNanchor_112:1_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_112:1_517" class="fnanchor">[112:1]</a> (and <i>Cyrus</i> was perhaps the first referred to); but as no
one appeared who did what the Messiah, according to prophecy, should do,
they went on degrading each successive conqueror and hero from the
Messianic dignity, and are still expecting the true Deliverer. Hebrew
and Christian divines both start from the same assumed unproven
premises, viz.: that a Messiah, having been foretold, must appear; but
there they diverge, and the Jews show themselves to be the sounder
logicians of the two: the Christians assuming that Jesus was the Messiah
<i>intended</i> (though not the one <i>expected</i>), wrest the obvious meaning of
the prophecies to show that they were fulfilled in him; while the Jews,
assuming the obvious meaning of the prophecies to be their real meaning,
argue that they were not fulfilled in Christ Jesus, and therefore that
the Messiah is yet to come.</p>

<p>We shall now see, in the words of Bishop Hawes: "that God should, in
some extraordinary manner, visit and dwell with man, is an idea which,
as we read the writings of the <i>ancient Heathens</i>, meets us in a
thousand different forms."</p>

<p>Immaculate conceptions and celestial descents were so currently received
among the ancients, that whoever had greatly distinguished himself in
the affairs of men was thought to be of supernatural lineage. Gods
descended from heaven and were made incarnate in men, and men ascended
from earth, and took their seat among the gods, so that these
incarnations and apotheosises were fast filling Olympus with divinities.</p>

<p>In our inquiries on this subject we shall turn first to <i>Asia</i>, where,
as the learned Thomas Maurice remarks in his <i>Indian Antiquities</i>, "in
every age, and in almost every region of the Asiatic world, there seems
uniformly to have flourished an immemorial tradition that one god had,
from all eternity, <i>begotten another god</i>."<a name="FNanchor_112:2_518" id="FNanchor_112:2_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_112:2_518" class="fnanchor">[112:2]</a></p>

<p>In India, there have been several <i>Avatars</i>, or incarnations of
Vishnu,<a name="FNanchor_112:3_519" id="FNanchor_112:3_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_112:3_519" class="fnanchor">[112:3]</a> the most important of which is <i>Heri Crishna</i>,<a name="FNanchor_112:4_520" id="FNanchor_112:4_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_112:4_520" class="fnanchor">[112:4]</a> or
<i>Crishna the Saviour</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p><p>In the <i>Maha-bharata</i>, an Indian epic poem, written about the sixth
century B. C., Crishna is associated or identified with Vishnu the
Preserving god or Saviour.<a name="FNanchor_113:1_521" id="FNanchor_113:1_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_113:1_521" class="fnanchor">[113:1]</a></p>

<p>Sir William Jones, first President of the Royal Asiatic Society,
instituted in Bengal, says of him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Crishna continues to this hour the darling god of the Indian
woman. The sect of Hindoos who adore him with enthusiastic,
and almost exclusive devotion, have broached a doctrine, which
they maintain with eagerness, and which seems general in these
provinces, that he was distinct from all the <i>Avatars</i>
(incarnations) who had only an <i>ansa</i>, or a portion, of his
(<i>Vishnu's</i>) divinity, <i>while Crishna was the person of Vishnu
himself in human form</i>."<a name="FNanchor_113:2_522" id="FNanchor_113:2_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_113:2_522" class="fnanchor">[113:2]</a></p></div>

<p>The Rev. D. O. Allen, Missionary of the American Board, for twenty-five
years in India, speaking of Crishna, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He was greater than, and distinct from, all the <i>Avatars</i>
which had only a portion of the divinity in them, while he was
the very person of Vishnu himself in human form."<a name="FNanchor_113:3_523" id="FNanchor_113:3_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_113:3_523" class="fnanchor">[113:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Thomas Maurice, in speaking of <i>Mathura</i>, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is particularly celebrated for having been the birth-place
of <i>Crishna</i>, who is esteemed in India, not so much an
incarnation of the divine Vishnu, <i>as the deity himself in
human form</i>."<a name="FNanchor_113:4_524" id="FNanchor_113:4_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_113:4_524" class="fnanchor">[113:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Again, in his "<i>History of Hindostan</i>," he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It appears to me that the Hindoos, idolizing some eminent
character of antiquity, distinguished, in the early annals of
their nation, by heroic fortitude and exalted piety, have
applied to that character those ancient traditional accounts
of an <i>incarnate God</i>, or, as they not improperly term it, an
<i>Avatar</i>, which had been delivered down to them from their
ancestors, the virtuous Noachid&aelig;, to descend amidst the
darkness and ignorance of succeeding ages, at once to reform
and instruct mankind. We have the more solid reason to affirm
this of the Avatar of Crishna, because it is allowed to be the
most illustrious of them all; since we have learned, that, in
the <i>seven</i> preceding Avatars, the deity brought only an
<i>ansa</i>, or portion of his divinity; but, in the <i>eighth</i>, he
descended in all the plentitude of the Godhead, <i>and was
Vishnu himself in a human form</i>."<a name="FNanchor_113:5_525" id="FNanchor_113:5_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_113:5_525" class="fnanchor">[113:5]</a></p></div>

<p>Crishna was born of a chaste virgin,<a name="FNanchor_113:6_526" id="FNanchor_113:6_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_113:6_526" class="fnanchor">[113:6]</a> called <i>Devaki</i>, who, on
account of her purity, was selected to become the "<i>mother of God</i>."</p>

<p>According to the "<span class="allcapsc">BHAGAVAT POORAUN</span>," <i>Vishnu</i> said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I will become incarnate at Mathura in the house of <i>Yadu</i>,
and will issue <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>forth to mortal birth from the womb of
Devaki.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is time I should display my power, and relieve
the oppressed earth from its load."<a name="FNanchor_114:1_527" id="FNanchor_114:1_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_114:1_527" class="fnanchor">[114:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Then a chorus of angels exclaimed:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the delivery of this favored woman, all nature shall have
cause to exult."<a name="FNanchor_114:2_528" id="FNanchor_114:2_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_114:2_528" class="fnanchor">[114:2]</a></p></div>

<p>In the sacred book of the Hindoos, called "<i>Vishnu Purana</i>," we read as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Eulogized by the gods, Devaki bore in her womb the lotus-eyed
deity, the protector of the world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"No person could bear to gaze upon Devaki, from the light that
invested her, and those who contemplated her radiance felt
their minds disturbed. The gods, invisible to mortals,
celebrated her praises continually from the time that <i>Vishnu</i>
was contained in her person."<a name="FNanchor_114:3_529" id="FNanchor_114:3_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_114:3_529" class="fnanchor">[114:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Again we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The divine <i>Vishnu himself</i>, the root of the vast universal
tree, inscrutable by the understandings of all gods, demons,
sages, and men, past, present, or to come, adored by Brahma
and all the deities, he who is without beginning, middle, or
end, being moved to relieve the earth of her load, descended
into the womb of Devaki, and was born as her son, Vasudeva,"
<i>i. e.</i>, <i>Crishna</i>.<a name="FNanchor_114:4_530" id="FNanchor_114:4_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_114:4_530" class="fnanchor">[114:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Crishna is the very <i>Supreme Brahma</i>, though it be a
<i>mystery</i><a name="FNanchor_114:5_531" id="FNanchor_114:5_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_114:5_531" class="fnanchor">[114:5]</a> how the Supreme <i>should assume the form of a
man</i>."<a name="FNanchor_114:6_532" id="FNanchor_114:6_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_114:6_532" class="fnanchor">[114:6]</a></p></div>

<p>The Hindoo belief in a divine incarnation has at least, above many
others, its logical side of conceiving that God manifests himself on
earth whenever the weakness or the errors of humanity render his
presence necessary. We find this idea expressed in one of their sacred
books called the "<i>Bh&aacute;gavat Geeta</i>," wherein it says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I (the Supreme One said), I am made evident by my own power,
and as often as there is a decline of virtue, and an
insurrection of vice and injustice in the world, I make myself
evident, <i>and thus I appear from age to age</i>, for the
preservation of the just, the destruction of the wicked, and
the establishment of virtue."<a name="FNanchor_114:7_533" id="FNanchor_114:7_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_114:7_533" class="fnanchor">[114:7]</a></p></div>

<p>Crishna is recorded in the "<i>Bh&aacute;gavat Geeta</i>" as saying to his beloved
disciple Arjouna:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"He, O Arjoun, who, from conviction, acknowledgeth my <i>divine
birth</i> (upon quitting his mortal form), entereth into
me."<a name="FNanchor_115:1_534" id="FNanchor_115:1_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_115:1_534" class="fnanchor">[115:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Again, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The foolish, being <i>unacquainted with my supreme and divine
nature, as Lord of all things</i>, despise me in this <i>human
form</i>, trusting to the evil, diabolic, and deceitful principle
within them. They are of vain hope, of vain endeavors, of vain
wisdom, and void of reason; whilst men of great minds,
trusting to their divine natures, <i>discover that I am before
all things and incorruptible</i>, and serve me with their hearts
undiverted by other gods."<a name="FNanchor_115:2_535" id="FNanchor_115:2_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_115:2_535" class="fnanchor">[115:2]</a></p></div>

<p>The next in importance among the <i>God-begotten</i> and <i>Virgin-born</i>
Saviours of India, is <i>Buddha</i><a name="FNanchor_115:3_536" id="FNanchor_115:3_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_115:3_536" class="fnanchor">[115:3]</a> who was born of the Virgin Maya or
Mary. He in mercy left Paradise, and came down to earth because he was
filled with compassion for the sins and miseries of mankind. He sought
to lead them into better paths, and took their sufferings upon himself,
that he might expiate their crimes, and mitigate the punishment they
must otherwise inevitably undergo.<a name="FNanchor_115:4_537" id="FNanchor_115:4_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_115:4_537" class="fnanchor">[115:4]</a></p>

<p>According to the <i>Fo-pen-hing</i>,<a name="FNanchor_115:5_538" id="FNanchor_115:5_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_115:5_538" class="fnanchor">[115:5]</a> when Buddha was about to descend
from heaven, to be born into the world, the angels in heaven, calling to
the inhabitants of the earth, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ye mortals! adorn your earth! for B&ocirc;dhisatwa, the great
Mah&acirc;satwa, not long hence shall descend from Tusita to be born
amongst you! make ready and prepare! Buddha is about to
descend and be born!"<a name="FNanchor_115:6_539" id="FNanchor_115:6_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_115:6_539" class="fnanchor">[115:6]</a></p></div>

<p>The womb that bears a Buddha is like a casket in which a relic is
placed; no other being can be conceived in the same receptacle; the
usual secretions are not formed; and from the time of conception,
Maha-maya was free from passion, and lived in the strictest
continence.<a name="FNanchor_115:7_540" id="FNanchor_115:7_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_115:7_540" class="fnanchor">[115:7]</a></p>

<p>The resemblance between this legend and the doctrine of the <i>perpetual
virginity</i> of Mary the mother of Jesus, cannot but be remarked. The
opinion that she had ever borne other children was called heresy by
Epiphanius and Jerome, long before she had been exalted to the station
of supremacy she now occupies.<a name="FNanchor_115:8_541" id="FNanchor_115:8_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_115:8_541" class="fnanchor">[115:8]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p><p>M. l'Abb&eacute; Huc, a French Missionary, in speaking of Buddha, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the eyes of the Buddhists, this personage is sometimes a
man and sometimes a god, or rather both one and the other, <i>a
divine incarnation</i>, <i>a man-god</i>; who came into the world to
enlighten men, to redeem them, and to indicate to them the way
of safety.</p>

<p>"This idea of redemption by a <i>divine incarnation</i> is so
general and popular among the Buddhists, that during our
travels in Upper Asia, we everywhere found it expressed in a
neat formula. If we addressed to a Mongol or a Thibetan the
question, 'Who is Buddha?' he would immediately reply: '<i>The
Saviour of Men.</i>'"<a name="FNanchor_116:1_542" id="FNanchor_116:1_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_116:1_542" class="fnanchor">[116:1]</a></p></div>

<p>He further says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The miraculous birth of Buddha, his life and instructions,
contain a great number of the moral and dogmatic truths
professed in Christianity."<a name="FNanchor_116:2_543" id="FNanchor_116:2_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_116:2_543" class="fnanchor">[116:2]</a></p></div>

<p>This Angel-Messiah was regarded as the divinely chosen and incarnate
messenger, the vicar of God. He is addressed as "God of Gods," "Father
of the World," "Almighty and All-knowing Ruler," and "Redeemer of
All."<a name="FNanchor_116:3_544" id="FNanchor_116:3_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_116:3_544" class="fnanchor">[116:3]</a> He is called also "The Holy One," "The Author of
Happiness," "The Lord," "The Possessor of All," "He who is Omnipotent
and Everlastingly to be Contemplated," "The Supreme Being, the Eternal
One," "The Divinity worthy to be Adored by the most praiseworthy of
Mankind."<a name="FNanchor_116:4_545" id="FNanchor_116:4_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_116:4_545" class="fnanchor">[116:4]</a> He is addressed by Amora&mdash;one of his followers&mdash;thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Reverence be unto thee in the form of Buddha! Reverence be
unto thee, the Lord of the Earth! Reverence be unto thee, an
incarnation of the Deity! Of the Eternal One! Reverence be
unto thee, O God, in the form of the God of Mercy; the
dispeller of pain and trouble, the Lord of all things, the
deity, the guardian of the universe, the emblem of
mercy."<a name="FNanchor_116:5_546" id="FNanchor_116:5_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_116:5_546" class="fnanchor">[116:5]</a></p></div>

<p>The incarnation of Gautama Buddha is recorded to have been brought about
by the descent of the divine power called The "<i>Holy Ghost</i>" upon the
Virgin <i>Maya</i>.<a name="FNanchor_116:6_547" id="FNanchor_116:6_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_116:6_547" class="fnanchor">[116:6]</a> This Holy Ghost, or <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>Spirit, descended in the form
of a <i>white elephant</i>. The <i>Tikas</i> explain this as indicating power and
wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_117:1_548" id="FNanchor_117:1_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_117:1_548" class="fnanchor">[117:1]</a></p>

<p>The incarnation of the angel destined to become Buddha took place in a
spiritual manner. The Elephant is the symbol of power and wisdom; and
Buddha was considered the organ of divine power and wisdom, as he is
called in the Tikas. For these reasons Buddha is described by Buddhistic
legends as having descended from heaven in the form of an Elephant to
the place where the Virgin Maya was. But according to Chinese Buddhistic
writings, it was the Holy Ghost, or <i>Shing-Shin</i>, who descended on the
Virgin Maya.<a name="FNanchor_117:2_549" id="FNanchor_117:2_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_117:2_549" class="fnanchor">[117:2]</a></p>

<p>In Prof. Fergusson's "<i>Tree and Serpent Worship</i>" may be seen (Plate
xxxiii.) a representation of Maya, the mother of Buddha, asleep, and
dreaming that a white elephant appeared to her, and entered her womb.</p>

<p>This dream being interpreted by the Brahmans learned in the <i>Rig Veda</i>,
was considered as announcing the incarnation of him who was to be in
future the deliverer of mankind from pain and sorrow. It is, in fact,
the form which the Annunciation took in Buddhist legends.<a name="FNanchor_117:4_551" id="FNanchor_117:4_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_117:4_551" class="fnanchor">[117:4]</a></p>

<p>In Fig. 4, Plate xci., the same subject is also illustrated. Prof.
Fergusson, referring to it, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Fig. 4 is another edition of a legend more frequently
repeated than almost any other in Buddhist Scriptures. It was,
with their artists, as great a favorite as the Annunciation
and Nativity were with Christian painters."<a name="FNanchor_118:1_552" id="FNanchor_118:1_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_118:1_552" class="fnanchor">[118:1]</a></p></div>

<p>When Buddha <i>avatar</i> descended from the regions of the souls, and
entered the body of the Virgin Maya, her womb suddenly assumed the
appearance of clear, transparent crystal, in which Buddha appeared,
beautiful as a flower, kneeling and reclining on his hands.<a name="FNanchor_118:2_553" id="FNanchor_118:2_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_118:2_553" class="fnanchor">[118:2]</a></p>

<p>Buddha's representative on earth is the <i>Dalai Lama</i>, or <i>Grand Lama</i>,
the High Priest of the Tartars. He is regarded as the vicegerent of God,
with power to dispense divine blessings on whomsoever he will, and is
considered among the Buddhists to be a sort of divine being. He is the
Pope of Buddhism.<a name="FNanchor_118:3_554" id="FNanchor_118:3_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_118:3_554" class="fnanchor">[118:3]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Siamese</i> had a Virgin-born God and Saviour whom they called
<i>Codom</i>. His mother, a beautiful young virgin, being inspired from
heaven, quitted the society of men and wandered into the most
unfrequented parts of a great forest, there to await the coming of a god
which had long been announced to mankind. While she was one day
prostrate in prayer, she was <i>impregnated by the sunbeams</i>. She
thereupon retired to the borders of a lake, between Siam and Cambodia,
where she was delivered of a "<i>heavenly boy</i>," which she placed within
the folds of a <i>lotus</i>, that opened to receive him. When the boy grew
up, he became a prodigy of wisdom, performed miracles, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_118:4_555" id="FNanchor_118:4_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_118:4_555" class="fnanchor">[118:4]</a></p>

<p>The first Europeans who visited Cape Comorin, the most <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>southerly
extremity of the peninsula of Hindostan, were surprised to find the
inhabitants worshiping a Lord and Saviour whom they called <i>Salivahana</i>.
They related that his father's name was Taishaca, but that he was <i>a
divine child horn of a Virgin</i>, in fact, an incarnation of the Supreme
<i>Vishnu</i>.<a name="FNanchor_119:1_556" id="FNanchor_119:1_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_119:1_556" class="fnanchor">[119:1]</a></p>

<p>The belief in a virgin-born god-man is found in the religions of China.
As Sir John Francis Davis remarks,<a name="FNanchor_119:2_557" id="FNanchor_119:2_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_119:2_557" class="fnanchor">[119:2]</a> "China has her mythology in
common with all other nations, and under this head we must range the
persons styled <i>Fo-hi</i> (or Fuh-he), <i>Shin-noong</i>, <i>Hoang-ty</i> and their
immediate successors, who, like the demi gods and heroes of Grecian
fable, rescued mankind by their ability or enterprise from the most
primitive barbarism, and have since been invested with <i>superhuman</i>
attributes. The most extravagant prodigies are related of these persons,
and the most incongruous qualities attributed to them."</p>

<p>Dean Milman, in his "History of Christianity" (Vol. i. p. 97), refers to
the tradition, found among the Chinese, that <i>Fo-hi</i> was born of a
virgin; and remarks that, the first Jesuit missionaries who went to
China were appalled at finding, in the mythology of that country, a
counterpart of the story of the virgin of Judea.</p>

<p>Fo-hi is said to have been born 3463 years <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, and, according to some
Chinese writers, with him begins the historical era and the foundation
of the empire. When his mother conceived him in her womb, a rainbow was
seen to surround her.<a name="FNanchor_119:3_558" id="FNanchor_119:3_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_119:3_558" class="fnanchor">[119:3]</a></p>

<p>The Chinese traditions concerning the birth of Fo-hi are, some of them,
highly poetical. That which has received the widest acceptance is as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Three nymphs came down from heaven to wash themselves in a
river; but scarce had they got there before the herb <i>lotus</i>
appeared on one of their garments, with its coral fruit upon
it. They could not imagine whence it proceeded, and one was
tempted to taste it, whereby she became pregnant and was
delivered of a boy, who afterwards became a great man, a
founder of religion, a conqueror, and legislator."<a name="FNanchor_119:4_559" id="FNanchor_119:4_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_119:4_559" class="fnanchor">[119:4]</a></p></div>

<p>The sect of <i>Xaca</i>, which is evidently a corruption of Buddhism, claim
that their master was also of supernatural origin. Alvarez Semedo,
speaking of them, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The third religious sect among the Chinese is from India,
from the parts of Hindostan, which sect they call <i>Xaca</i>, from
the founder of it, concerning whom they fable&mdash;that he was
conceived by his mother Maya, from a white elephant, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>which
she saw in her sleep, and for more purity she brought him from
one of her sides."<a name="FNanchor_120:1_560" id="FNanchor_120:1_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_120:1_560" class="fnanchor">[120:1]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Lao-kiun</i>, sometimes celled <i>Lao-tsze</i>, who is said to have been born
in the third year of the emperor <i>Ting-wang</i>, of the Chow dynasty (604
<span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>), was another miraculously-born man. He acquired great reputation
for sanctity, and marvelous stories were told of his birth. It was said
that he had existed from all eternity; that he had descended on earth
<i>and was born of a virgin</i>, black in complexion, described "marvelous
and beautiful as jasper." Splendid temples were erected to him, and he
was worshiped as a <i>god</i>. His disciples were called "Heavenly Teachers."
They inculcated great tenderness toward animals, and considered strict
celibacy necessary for the attainment of perfect holiness. Lao-kiun
believed in <i>One God</i> whom he called <i>Tao</i>, and the sect which he formed
is called <i>Tao-tse</i>, or "Sect of Reason." Sir Thomas Thornton, speaking
of him, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The mythological history of this 'prince of the doctrine of
the <i>Taou</i>,' which is current amongst his followers,
<i>represents him as a divine emanation incarnate in a human
form</i>. They term him the 'most high and venerable prince of
the portals of gold of the palace of the <i>genii</i>,' and say
that he condescended to a contact with humanity when he became
incorporated with the 'miraculous and excellent Virgin of
jasper.' Like Buddha, he came out of his mother's side, and
was born under a tree.</p>

<p>"The legends of the <i>Taou-tse</i> declare their founder to have
existed antecedent to the birth of the elements, in the Great
Absolute; that he is the 'pure essence of the t&euml;en;' that he
is the 'original ancestor of the prime breath of life;' and
that he gave form to the heavens and the earth."<a name="FNanchor_120:2_561" id="FNanchor_120:2_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_120:2_561" class="fnanchor">[120:2]</a></p></div>

<p>M. Le Compte says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Those who have made this (the religion of Taou-tsze) their
professed business, are called <i>Tien-se</i>, that is, 'Heavenly
Doctors;' they have houses (Monasteries) given them to live
together in society; they erect, in divers parts, temples to
their master, and king and people honor him with <i>divine</i>
worship."</p></div>

<p><i>Yu</i> was another <i>virgin-born</i> Chinese sage, who is said to have lived
upon earth many ages ago. Confucius&mdash;as though he had been questioned
about him&mdash;says: "I see no defect in the character of Yu. He was sober
in eating and drinking, and eminently pious toward spirits and
ancestors."<a name="FNanchor_120:3_562" id="FNanchor_120:3_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_120:3_562" class="fnanchor">[120:3]</a></p>

<p><i>H&acirc;u-ki</i>, the Chinese hero, was of supernatural origin.</p>

<p>The following is the history of his birth, according to the "Shih-King:"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"His mother, who was childless, had presented a pure offering
and sacrificed, that her childlessness might be taken away.
She then trod on a toe-print made by God, and was
moved,<a name="FNanchor_121:1_563" id="FNanchor_121:1_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_121:1_563" class="fnanchor">[121:1]</a> in the large place where she rested. She became
pregnant; she dwelt retired; she gave birth to and nourished a
son, who was <i>H&acirc;u-ki</i>. When she had fulfilled her months, her
first-born son came forth like a lamb. There was no bursting,
no rending, no injury, no hurt; showing how wonderful he would
be. Did not God give her comfort? Had he not accepted her pure
offering and sacrifice, so that thus easily she brought forth
her son?"<a name="FNanchor_121:2_564" id="FNanchor_121:2_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_121:2_564" class="fnanchor">[121:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Even the sober Confucius (born <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> 501) was of supernatural origin.
The most important event in Chinese literary and ethical history is the
birth of <i>Kung-foo-tsze</i> (Confucius), both in its effects on the moral
organization of this great empire, and the study of Chinese philosophy
in Europe.</p>

<p>Kung-foo-tsze (meaning "the sage Kung" or "the wise excellence") was of
<i>royal descent</i>; and his family the most ancient in the empire, as his
genealogy was traceable directly up to Hwang-te, the reputed organizer
of the state, the first emperor of the semi-historical period (beginning
2696 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>).</p>

<p>At his birth a prodigious quadruped, called the Ke-lin, appeared and
prophesied that the new-born infant "would be a king without throne or
territory." Two dragons hovered about the couch of <i>Yen-she</i> (his
mother), and five celestial sages, or angels, entered at the moment of
the birth of the wondrous child; heavenly strains were heard in the air,
and harmonious chords followed each other, fast and full. Thus was
Confucius ushered into the world.</p>

<p>His disciples, who were to expound his precepts, were seventy-two in
number, <i>twelve</i> of whom were his ordinary companions, the depositories
of his thoughts, and the witnesses of all his actions. To them he
minutely explained his doctrines, and charged them with their
propagation after his death. <span class="smcap">Yan-hwuy</span> was his favorite disciple, who, in
his opinion, had attained the highest degree of moral perfection.
Confucius addressed him in terms of great affection, which denoted that
he relied mainly upon him for the accomplishment of his work.<a name="FNanchor_121:3_565" id="FNanchor_121:3_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_121:3_565" class="fnanchor">[121:3]</a></p>

<p>Even as late as the seventeenth century of our era, do we find the myth
of the virgin-born God in China.<a name="FNanchor_121:4_566" id="FNanchor_121:4_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_121:4_566" class="fnanchor">[121:4]</a></p>

<p>If from China we should turn to Egypt we would find that, for ages
before the time of Jesus of Nazareth, the mediating deity, born of a
virgin, and without a worldly father, was a portion of the Egyptian
belief.<a name="FNanchor_122:1_567" id="FNanchor_122:1_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_122:1_567" class="fnanchor">[122:1]</a></p>

<p><i>Horus</i>, who had the epithet of "<i>Saviour</i>," was born of the virgin

<p>The ancient Egyptians also deified kings and heroes, in the same manner
as the ancient Greeks and Romans. An Egyptian king became, in a sense,
"the vicar of God on earth, the infallible, and the personated
deity."<a name="FNanchor_122:7_573" id="FNanchor_122:7_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_122:7_573" class="fnanchor">[122:7]</a></p>

<p>P. Le Page Renouf, in his Hibbert Lectures on the Religion of Ancient
Egypt, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I must not quit this part of my subject without a reference
to the belief that the ruling sovereign of Egypt was the
living image and vicegerent of the Sun-god (<i>Ra</i>). <i>He was
invested with the attributes of divinity</i>, and that in the
earliest times of which we possess monumental
evidence."<a name="FNanchor_122:8_574" id="FNanchor_122:8_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_122:8_574" class="fnanchor">[122:8]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Menes</i>, who is said to have been the first king of Egypt, was believed
to be a god.<a name="FNanchor_122:9_575" id="FNanchor_122:9_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_122:9_575" class="fnanchor">[122:9]</a></p>

<p>Almost all the temples of the left bank of the Nile, at Thebes, had been
constructed in view of the worship rendered to the Pharaohs, their
founders, after their death.<a name="FNanchor_122:10_576" id="FNanchor_122:10_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_122:10_576" class="fnanchor">[122:10]</a></p>

<p>An inscription found in Egypt makes the god <i>Ra</i> say to his son Ramses
III.:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am thy father; by me are begotten all thy members as

<p><i>Raam-ses</i>, or <i>Ra-m&eacute;-ses</i>, means "Son of the Sun," and <i>Ramses Hek An</i>,

<p>"<i>Thotmes</i> III., on the tablet of Karnak, presents offerings to his
predecessors; so does <i>Ramses</i> on the tablet of Abydos. Even during his

<p>The ancient Babylonians also believed that their kings were gods upon
earth. A passage from M&eacute;naut's translation of the great inscription of
Nebuchadnezzar, reads thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am Nabu-kuder-usur .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the first-born son of Nebu-pal-usur,
King of Babylon. The god <i>Bel</i> himself created me, the god

<p>In the life of <i>Zoroaster</i>, the law-giver of the <i>Persians</i>, the common
mythos is apparent. He was born in innocence, of an immaculate
conception, of a ray of the Divine Reason. As soon as he was born the
glory from his body enlightened the whole room.<a name="FNanchor_123:6_582" id="FNanchor_123:6_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_123:6_582" class="fnanchor">[123:6]</a> Plato informs us

of God</i>.</p>

<p>From the East we will turn to the West, and shall find that many of the
ancient heroes of Grecian and Roman mythology were regarded as of divine
origin, were represented as men, possessed of god-like form, strength
and courage; were believed to have lived on earth in the remote, dim
ages of the nation's history; to have been occupied in their life-time
with thrilling adventures and extraordinary services in the cause of
human civilization, and to have been after death in some cases
translated to a life among the gods, and entitled to sacrifice and
worship. In the hospitable Pantheon of the Greeks and Romans, a niche
was always in readiness <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>for every new divinity who could produce
respectable credentials.</p>

<p>The Christian Father Justin Martyr, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It having reached the Devil's ears that the prophets had
foretold the coming of Christ (<i>the Son of God</i>), he set the
<i>Heathen Poets</i> to bring forward a great many who should be
called <i>the sons of Jove</i>. The Devil laying his scheme in
this, to get men to imagine that the <i>true</i> history of Christ
was of the same character as the <i>prodigious fables</i> related
of the sons of Jove."</p></div>

<p>Among these "sons of Jove" may be mentioned the following: <i>Hercules</i>
was the son of Jupiter by a mortal mother, Alcmene, Queen of
Thebes.<a name="FNanchor_124:1_584" id="FNanchor_124:1_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_124:1_584" class="fnanchor">[124:1]</a> Zeus, the god of gods, spake of Hercules, his son, and

<p>Justin Martyr (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 140), in his Apology to the Emperor Adrian, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"By declaring the Logos, the first-begotten of God, our
Master, Jesus Christ, to be born of a virgin, without any
human mixture, we (Christians) <i>say no more in this than what
you</i> (Pagans) <i>say of those whom you style the Sons of Jove</i>.
For <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>you need not be told what a parcel of sons the writers
most in vogue among you assign to Jove.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"As to the Son of God, called Jesus, should we allow him to be
nothing more than man, yet the title of 'the Son of God' is
very justifiable, upon the account of his wisdom, considering
that you (Pagans) have your Mercury in worship under the title
of the Word, a messenger of God.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"As to his (Jesus Christ's) being born of a virgin, <i>you have
your Perseus to balance that</i>."<a name="FNanchor_125:1_593" id="FNanchor_125:1_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_125:1_593" class="fnanchor">[125:1]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Mercury</i> was the son of Jupiter and a mortal mother, Maia, daughter of

<p>We might continue and give the names of many more sons of Jove, but
sufficient has been seen, we believe, to show, in the words of Justin,
that Jove had a great "parcel of sons." "The images of self-restraint,

<p>The ancient Romans were in the habit of deifying their living and
departed emperors, and gave to them the title of <span class="smcap">Divus</span>, or the Divine

<p>"The honors due to the gods," says Tacitus, "were no longer sacred:

<p><i>Ptolemy</i>, who was one of Alexander's generals in his Eastern campaigns,
and into whose hands Egypt fell at the death of Alexander, was also
believed to have been of divine origin. At the siege of Rhodes, Ptolemy
had been of such signal service to its citizens that in gratitude they
paid <i>divine honors</i> to him, and saluted him with the title of <i>Soter</i>,
<i>i. e.</i>, Saviour. By that designation, "<i>Ptolemy Soter</i>," he is

<p>Prof. Draper, speaking of Plato, says:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"The Egyptian disciples of Plato would have looked with anger
on those who rejected the legend that Perictione, the mother
of that great philosopher, a pure virgin, had suffered an
immaculate conception through the influences of (the god)

<p>Here we have the legend of the angel appearing to Joseph&mdash;to whom Mary

husband's name Aris instead of Joseph. We have another similar case.</p>

<p><i>Pythagoras</i>, born about 570 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, had divine honors paid him. His

the son of a god and a worldly mother, Coronis. The Messenians, who
consulted the oracle at Delphi to know where &AElig;sculapius was born, and of
what parents, were informed that a god was his father, Coronis his
mother, and that their son was born at Epidaurus.</p>

<p>Coronis, to conceal her pregnancy from her father, went to Epidaurus,
where she was delivered of a son, whom she exposed on a mountain.
Aristhenes, a goat-herd, going in search of a goat and a dog missing

<p>Justin Martyr, quoted by Eusebius, tells us that Simon Magus attained
great honor among the Romans. That he was believed to be a <i>god</i>, and
that he was worshiped as such. Between two bridges upon the River
Tibris, was to be seen this inscription: "Simoni Deo Sancto," <i>i. e.</i>

<p>It was customary with all the heroes of the northern nations (Danes,
Swedes, Norwegians and Icelanders), to speak of themselves as sprung
from their supreme deity, <i>Odin</i>. The historians of those times, that is
to say, the poets, never failed to bestow the same honor on all those
whose praises they sang; and thus they multiplied the descendants of
Odin as much as they found convenient. The first-begotten son of Odin
was Thor, whom the Eddas call the most valiant of his sons. "Baldur the
Good," the "Beneficent Saviour," was the son of the Supreme Odin and the
goddess Frigga, whose worship was transferred to that of the Virgin
Mary.<a name="FNanchor_129:3_631" id="FNanchor_129:3_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_129:3_631" class="fnanchor">[129:3]</a></p>

<p>In the mythological systems of <i>America</i>, a virgin-born god was not less
clearly recognized than in those of the Old World. Among the savage
tribes his origin and character were, for obvious reasons, much
confused; but among the more advanced nations he occupied a well-defined
position. Among the nations of Anahuac, he bore the name of
<i>Quetzalcoatle</i>, and was regarded with the highest veneration.</p>

<p>For ages before the landing of Columbus on its shores, the inhabitants
of ancient Mexico worshiped a "Saviour"&mdash;as they called
him&mdash;(<i>Quetzalcoatle</i>) who was <i>born of a pure virgin</i>.<a name="FNanchor_129:4_632" id="FNanchor_129:4_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_129:4_632" class="fnanchor">[129:4]</a> <i>A

<p>The embassador was sent from heaven to this virgin, who had two sisters,
Tzochitlique and Conatlique. "These three being alone in the house, two
of them, on perceiving the embassador from heaven, died of fright,
Sochiquetzal remaining alive, to whom the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>ambassador announced that it

<p>Dr. Daniel Brinton, in his "Myths of the New World," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Central figure of Toltec mythology is <i>Quetzalcoatle</i>.
Not an author on ancient Mexico, but has something to say
about the glorious days when he ruled over the land. No one
denies him to have been a god. <i>He was born of a virgin</i> in
the land of <i>Tula</i> or <i>Tlopallan</i>."<a name="FNanchor_130:3_638" id="FNanchor_130:3_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_130:3_638" class="fnanchor">[130:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The Mayas of <i>Yucatan</i> had a virgin-born god, corresponding entirely
with Quetzalcoatle, if he was not the same under a different name, a
conjecture very well sustained by the evident relationship between the
Mexican and Mayan mythologies. He was named <i>Zama</i>, and was the
only-begotten son of their supreme god, Kinchahan.<a name="FNanchor_130:4_639" id="FNanchor_130:4_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_130:4_639" class="fnanchor">[130:4]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Muyscas</i> of Columbia had a similar hero-god. According to their
traditionary history, he bore the name of <i>Bochica</i>. He was the
incarnation of the Great Father, whose sovereignty and paternal care he
emblematized.<a name="FNanchor_130:5_640" id="FNanchor_130:5_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_130:5_640" class="fnanchor">[130:5]</a></p>

<p>The inhabitants of <i>Nicaragua</i> called their principal god Thomathoyo;
and said that he had a <i>son</i>, who came down to earth, whose name was
Theotbilahe, and that he was their general instructor.<a name="FNanchor_130:6_641" id="FNanchor_130:6_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_130:6_641" class="fnanchor">[130:6]</a></p>

<p>We find a corresponding character in the traditionary history of <i>Peru</i>.
The Sun&mdash;the god of the Peruvians&mdash;deploring their miserable condition,
sent down his son, <i>Manco Capac</i>, to instruct them in religion,
&amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_130:7_642" id="FNanchor_130:7_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_130:7_642" class="fnanchor">[130:7]</a></p>

<p>We have also traces of a similar personage in the traditionary <i>Votan</i>
of <i>Guatemala</i>; but our accounts concerning him are more vague than in
the cases above mentioned.</p>

<p>We find this traditional character in countries and among tribes where
we would be least apt to suspect its existence. In <i>Brazil</i>, besides the
common belief in an age of violence, during which the world was
destroyed by water, there is a tradition of a supernatural personage
called <i>Zome</i>, whose history is similar, in some respects, to that of
Quetzalcoatle.<a name="FNanchor_130:8_643" id="FNanchor_130:8_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_130:8_643" class="fnanchor">[130:8]</a></p>

<p>The semi-civilized agricultural tribes of <i>Florida</i> had like traditions.
The <i>Cherokees</i>, in particular, had a priest and law-giver <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span><i>essentially
corresponding to Quetzalcoatle and Bochica</i>. He was their great prophet,
and bore the name of <i>Wasi</i>. "He told them what had been from the
beginning of the world, and what would be, and gave the people in all
things directions what to do. He appointed their feasts and fasts, and
all the ceremonies of their religion, and enjoined upon them to obey his
directions from generation to generation."<a name="FNanchor_131:1_644" id="FNanchor_131:1_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_131:1_644" class="fnanchor">[131:1]</a></p>

<p>Among the savage tribes the same notions prevailed. The <i>Edues</i> of the
Californians taught that there was a supreme Creator, <i>Niparaga</i>, and
that his son, <i>Quaagagp</i>, came down upon the earth and instructed the
Indians in religion, &amp;c. Finally, through hatred, the Indians killed
him; but although dead, he is incorruptible and beautiful. To him they
pay adoration, as the <i>mediatory power</i> between earth and the Supreme
Niparaga.<a name="FNanchor_131:2_645" id="FNanchor_131:2_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_131:2_645" class="fnanchor">[131:2]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Iroquois</i> also had a beneficent being, uniting in himself the
character of <i>a god and man</i>, who was called <i>Tarengawagan</i>. He imparted
to them the knowledge of the laws of the Great Spirit, established their
form of government, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_131:3_646" id="FNanchor_131:3_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_131:3_646" class="fnanchor">[131:3]</a></p>

<p>Among the <i>Algonquins</i>, and particularly among the <i>Ojibways</i> and other
remnants of that stock of the North-west, this intermediate great
teacher (denominated, by Mr. Schoolcraft, in his "<i>Notes of the
Iroquois</i>," "the great incarnation of the North-west") is fully
recognized. He bears the name of <i>Michabou</i>, and is represented as <i>the
first-born son of a great celestial Manitou</i>, or <i>Spirit, by an earthly
mother</i>, and is esteemed the friend and protector of the human
race.<a name="FNanchor_131:4_647" id="FNanchor_131:4_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_131:4_647" class="fnanchor">[131:4]</a></p>

<p>I think we can now say with M. Dupuis, that "the idea of a God, who came
down on earth to save mankind, is neither new nor peculiar to the
Christians," and with Cicero, the great Roman orator and philosopher,
that "brave, famous or powerful men, after death, came to be <i>gods</i>, and
they are the very ones whom we are accustomed to worship, pray to and
venerate."</p>

<p>Taking for granted that the synoptic Gospels are historical, there is no
proof that Jesus ever claimed to be either God, or a god; on the other
hand, it is quite the contrary.<a name="FNanchor_131:5_648" id="FNanchor_131:5_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_131:5_648" class="fnanchor">[131:5]</a> As Viscount Amberly says: "The
best proof of this is that Jesus never, at any period of his life,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>desired his followers to worship him, either as God, or as the Son of
God," in the sense in which it is now understood. Had he believed of
himself what his followers subsequently believed of him, that he was one
of the constituent persons in a divine Trinity, he must have enjoined
his Apostles both to address him in prayer themselves, and to desire
their converts to do likewise. It is quite plain that he did nothing of
the kind, and that they never supposed him to have done so.</p>

<p>Belief in Jesus <i>as the Messiah</i> was taught as the first dogma of
Christianity, but adoration of Jesus <i>as God</i> was not taught at all.</p>

<p>But we are not left in this matter to depend on conjectural inferences.
The words put into the mouth of Jesus are plain. Whenever occasion
arose, <i>he asserted his inferiority to the Father</i>, though, as no one
had then dreamt of his equality, it is natural that the occasions should
not have been frequent.</p>

<p>He made himself <i>inferior in knowledge</i> when he said that of the day and
hour of the day of judgment no one knew, neither the angels in heaven
nor the Son; no one except the Father.<a name="FNanchor_132:1_649" id="FNanchor_132:1_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_132:1_649" class="fnanchor">[132:1]</a></p>

<p>He made himself <i>inferior in power</i> when he said that seats on his right
hand and on his left in the kingdom of heaven were not his to
give.<a name="FNanchor_132:2_650" id="FNanchor_132:2_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_132:2_650" class="fnanchor">[132:2]</a></p>

<p>He made himself <i>inferior in virtue</i> when he desired a certain man not
to address him as "Good Master," for there was none good but God.<a name="FNanchor_132:3_651" id="FNanchor_132:3_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_132:3_651" class="fnanchor">[132:3]</a></p>

<p>The words of his prayer at Gethsemane, "all things are possible unto
<i>thee</i>," imply that all things were <i>not</i> possible to <i>him</i>, while its
conclusion "not what <i>I will</i>, but what <i>thou wilt</i>," indicates
submission to a superior, not the mere execution of a purpose of his
own.<a name="FNanchor_132:4_652" id="FNanchor_132:4_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_132:4_652" class="fnanchor">[132:4]</a> Indeed, the whole prayer would have been a mockery, useless
for any purpose but the deception of his disciples, if he had himself
been identical with the Being to whom he prayed, and had merely been
giving effect by his death to their common counsels. While the cry of
agony from the cross, "<i>My God, my God! why hast thou forsaken
me?</i>"<a name="FNanchor_132:5_653" id="FNanchor_132:5_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_132:5_653" class="fnanchor">[132:5]</a> would have been quite unmeaning if <i>the person forsaken</i>,
and <i>the person forsaking</i>, had been <i>one and the same</i>.</p>

<p><i>Either, then, we must assume that the language of Jesus has been
misreported, or we must admit that he never for a moment pretended to be
co-equal, co-eternal or consubstantial with God.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p><p>It also follows of necessity from <i>both the genealogies</i>,<a name="FNanchor_133:1_654" id="FNanchor_133:1_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_133:1_654" class="fnanchor">[133:1]</a> that
their compilers entertained no doubt that <i>Joseph</i> was the father of
Jesus. Otherwise the descent of Joseph would not have been in the least
to the point. All attempts to reconcile this inconsistency with the
doctrine of the Angel-Messiah has been without avail, although the most
learned Christian divines, for many generations past, have endeavored to
do so.</p>

<p>So, too, of the stories of the Presentation in the Temple,<a name="FNanchor_133:2_655" id="FNanchor_133:2_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_133:2_655" class="fnanchor">[133:2]</a> and of
the child Jesus at Jerusalem,<a name="FNanchor_133:3_656" id="FNanchor_133:3_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_133:3_656" class="fnanchor">[133:3]</a> <i>Joseph is called his father</i>.
Jesus is repeatedly described as <i>the son of the carpenter</i>,<a name="FNanchor_133:4_657" id="FNanchor_133:4_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_133:4_657" class="fnanchor">[133:4]</a> or
the <i>son of Joseph</i>, without the least indication that the expression is
not strictly in accordance with the fact.<a name="FNanchor_133:5_658" id="FNanchor_133:5_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_133:5_658" class="fnanchor">[133:5]</a></p>

<p>If his parents fail to understand him when he says, at twelve years old,
that he must be about his Father's business;<a name="FNanchor_133:6_659" id="FNanchor_133:6_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_133:6_659" class="fnanchor">[133:6]</a> if he afterwards
declares that he finds no faith among his nearest relations;<a name="FNanchor_133:7_660" id="FNanchor_133:7_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_133:7_660" class="fnanchor">[133:7]</a> if
he exalts his faithful disciples above his <i>unbelieving mother</i> and
brothers;<a name="FNanchor_133:8_661" id="FNanchor_133:8_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_133:8_661" class="fnanchor">[133:8]</a> above all, if Mary and her other sons put down his
prophetic enthusiasm to <i>insanity</i>;<a name="FNanchor_133:9_662" id="FNanchor_133:9_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_133:9_662" class="fnanchor">[133:9]</a>&mdash;then the untrustworthy
nature of these stories of his birth is absolutely certain. If even a
<i>little</i> of what they tell us had been true, then <i>Mary at least</i> would
have believed in Jesus, and would not have failed so utterly to
understand him.<a name="FNanchor_133:10_663" id="FNanchor_133:10_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_133:10_663" class="fnanchor">[133:10]</a></p>

<p>The Gospel of Mark&mdash;which, in this respect, at least, abides most
faithfully by the old apostolic tradition&mdash;says not a word about
Bethlehem or <i>the miraculous birth</i>. The congregation of Jerusalem to
which Mary and the brothers of Jesus belonged,<a name="FNanchor_133:11_664" id="FNanchor_133:11_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_133:11_664" class="fnanchor">[133:11]</a> and over which
the eldest of them, James, presided,<a name="FNanchor_133:12_665" id="FNanchor_133:12_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_133:12_665" class="fnanchor">[133:12]</a> can have known nothing of
it; for the later Jewish-Christian communities, the so-called Ebionites,
who were descended from the congregation at Jerusalem, called Jesus <i>the
son of Joseph</i>. Nay, the story that the <i>Holy Spirit</i> was the father of
Jesus, must have risen among <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>the <i>Greeks</i>, or elsewhere, and not among
the first believers, who were Jews, for the Hebrew word for <i>spirit</i> is
of <i>the feminine gender</i>.<a name="FNanchor_134:1_666" id="FNanchor_134:1_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_134:1_666" class="fnanchor">[134:1]</a></p>

<p>The immediate successors of the "congregation at Jerusalem"&mdash;to which
Mary, the mother of Jesus, and his brothers belonged&mdash;were, as we have
seen, the Ebionites. Eusebius, the first ecclesiastical historian (born
<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 264), speaking of the <i>Ebionites</i> (<i>i. e.</i> "poor men"), tell us
that they believed Jesus to be "<i>a simple and common man</i>," born as
other men, "<i>of Mary and her husband</i>."<a name="FNanchor_134:2_667" id="FNanchor_134:2_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_134:2_667" class="fnanchor">[134:2]</a></p>

<p>The views held by the Ebionites of Jesus were, it is said, derived from
the Gospel of Matthew, <i>and what they learned direct from the Apostles</i>.
Matthew had been a hearer of Jesus, a companion of the Apostles, and had
seen and no doubt conversed with Mary. When he wrote his Gospel
everything was fresh in his mind, and there could be no object, on his
part, in writing the life of Jesus, to state falsehoods or omit
important truths in order to deceive his countrymen. If what is stated
in the <i>interpolated</i> first two chapters, concerning the miraculous
birth of Jesus, were true, Matthew would have known of it; and, knowing
it, why should he omit it in giving an account of the life of
Jesus?<a name="FNanchor_134:3_668" id="FNanchor_134:3_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_134:3_668" class="fnanchor">[134:3]</a></p>

<p>The Ebionites, or Nazarenes, as they were previously called were
rejected by the Jews <i>as apostates</i>, and by the Egyptian and Roman
Christians <i>as heretics</i>, therefore, until they completely disappear,
their history is one of tyrannical persecution. Although some traces of
that obsolete sect may be discovered as late as the fourth century, they
insensibly melted away, either into the Roman Christian Church, or into
the Jewish Synagogue,<a name="FNanchor_134:4_669" id="FNanchor_134:4_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_134:4_669" class="fnanchor">[134:4]</a> and with them perished the <i>original</i>
Gospel of Matthew, <i>the only Gospel written by an apostle</i>.</p>

<p>"Who, where masses of men are burning to burst the bonds of time and
sense, to deify and to adore, wants what seems earth-born, prosaic fact?
Woe to the man that dares to interpose it! Woe to the sect of faithful
Ebionites even, and on the very soil of Palestine, that dare to maintain
the earlier, humbler tradition! Swiftly do they become heretics,
revilers, blasphemers, though sanctioned by a James, brother of the
Lord."</p>

<p>Edward Gibbon, speaking of this most unfortunate sect, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A laudable regard for the honor of the first proselytes has
countenanced the belief, the hope, the wish, that the
Ebionites, or at least the Nazarenes, were <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>distinguished only
by their obstinate perseverance in the practice of the Mosaic
rites. Their churches have disappeared, <i>their books are
obliterated</i>, their obscure freedom might allow a latitude of
faith, and the softness of their infant creed would be
variously moulded by the zeal of prejudice of three hundred
years. Yet the most charitable criticism must refuse these
sectaries any knowledge of the pure and proper <i>divinity of
Christ</i>. Educated in the school of Jewish prophecy and
prejudice, they had never been taught to elevate their hope
above <i>a human</i> and temporal Messiah. If they had courage to
hail their king when he appeared in a plebeian garb, their
grosser apprehensions were incapable of discerning their God,
<i>who had studiously disguised his celestial character under
the name and person of a mortal</i>.</p>

<p>"The familiar companions of Jesus of Nazareth conversed with
their friend and countryman, who, in all the actions of
rational and human life, appeared of the same species with
themselves. His progress from infancy to youth and manhood was
marked by a regular increase in stature and wisdom; and after
a painful agony of mind and body, he expired on the
cross."<a name="FNanchor_135:1_670" id="FNanchor_135:1_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_135:1_670" class="fnanchor">[135:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The Jewish Christians then&mdash;the congregation of Jerusalem, and their
immediate successors, the Ebionites or Nazarenes&mdash;saw in their master
nothing more than <i>a man</i>. From this, and the other facts which we have
seen in this chapter, it is evident that the man Jesus of Nazareth was
deified long after his death, just as many other men had been deified
centuries before his time, and even <i>after</i>. Until it had been settled
by a council of bishops that Jesus was not only <i>a God</i>, but "<i>God
himself in human form</i>," who appeared on earth, as did Crishna of old,
to redeem and save mankind, there were many theories concerning his
nature.</p>

<p>Among the early Christians there were a certain class called by the
later Christians <i>Heretics</i>. Among these may be mentioned the
"<i>Carpocratians</i>," named after one Carpocrates. They maintained that
Jesus was a <i>mere man</i>, born of Joseph and Mary, <i>like other men</i>, but
that he was good and virtuous. "Some of them have the vanity," says
<i>Iren&aelig;us</i>, "to think that they may equal, or in some respects exceed,
Jesus himself."<a name="FNanchor_135:2_671" id="FNanchor_135:2_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_135:2_671" class="fnanchor">[135:2]</a></p>

<p>These are called by the general name of <i>Gnostics, and comprehend almost
all the sects of the first two ages</i>.<a name="FNanchor_135:3_672" id="FNanchor_135:3_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_135:3_672" class="fnanchor">[135:3]</a> They said that "all the
ancients, and even the Apostles themselves, received and taught the same
things which they held; and that the truth of the Gospel had been
preserved till the time of <i>Victor</i>, the thirteenth Bishop of Rome, but
by his successor, <i>Zephyrinus</i>, the truth had been corrupted."<a name="FNanchor_135:4_673" id="FNanchor_135:4_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_135:4_673" class="fnanchor">[135:4]</a></p>

<p>Eusebius, speaking of <i>Artemon</i> and his followers, who denied the
divinity of Christ, says:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"They affirm that all our ancestors, yea, and the Apostles
themselves, were of the same opinion, and taught the same with
them, and that this their true doctrine (for so they call it)
was preached and embraced unto the time of Victor, the
thirteenth Bishop of Rome after Peter, and corrupted by his
successor Zephyrinus."<a name="FNanchor_136:1_674" id="FNanchor_136:1_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_136:1_674" class="fnanchor">[136:1]</a></p></div>

<p>There were also the "<i>Cerinthians</i>," named after one Cerinthus, who
maintained that Jesus was <i>not</i> born of a virgin, which to them appeared
impossible, but that he was the son of Joseph and Mary, <i>born altogether
as other men are</i>; but he excelled all men in virtue, knowledge and
wisdom. At the time of his baptism, "<i>the Christ</i>" came down upon him in
the shape of a dove, and <i>left him</i> at the time of his
crucifixion.<a name="FNanchor_136:2_675" id="FNanchor_136:2_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_136:2_675" class="fnanchor">[136:2]</a></p>

<p>Iren&aelig;us, speaking of Cerinthus and his doctrines, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He represents Jesus as the son of Joseph and Mary, according
to the ordinary course of human generation, and <i>not</i> as
having been born of a virgin. He believed nevertheless that he
was more righteous, prudent and wise than most men, and that
<i>the Christ</i> descended upon, and entered into him, at the time
of his baptism."<a name="FNanchor_136:3_676" id="FNanchor_136:3_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_136:3_676" class="fnanchor">[136:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The <i>Docetes</i> were a numerous and learned sect of Asiatic Christians who
invented the <i>Phantastic</i> system, which was afterwards promulgated by
the Marcionites, the Manicheans, and various other sects.</p>

<p>They denied the truth and authenticity of the Gospels, as far as they
related to the conception of Mary, the birth of Jesus, and the thirty
years that preceded the exercise of his ministry.</p>

<p>Bordering upon the Jewish and Gentile world, the <i>Cerinthians</i> labored
to reconcile the <i>Gnostic</i> and the <i>Ebionite</i>, by confessing in the
<i>same Messiah</i> the supernatural union of a man and a god; and this
<i>mystic</i> doctrine was adopted, with many fanciful improvements, by many
sects. The hypothesis was this: that Jesus of Nazareth was a mere
mortal, the legitimate son of Joseph and Mary, but he was <i>the best</i> and
wisest of the human race, selected as the worthy instrument to restore
upon earth the worship of the true and supreme Deity. When he was
baptized in the Jordan, <i>and not till then</i>, he became <i>more than man</i>.
At that time, <i>the Christ</i>, the first of the <i>&AElig;ons</i>, the Son of God
himself, descended on Jesus in the form of a dove, <i>to inhabit his
mind</i>, and direct his actions during the allotted period of <i>his
ministry</i>. When he was delivered into the hands of the Jews, <i>the
Christ</i> forsook him, flew back to the world of spirits, and left the
<i>solitary Jesus</i> to suffer, to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>complain, and to die. This is why he
said, while hanging on the cross: "My God! My God! why hast thou
forsaken me?"<a name="FNanchor_137:1_677" id="FNanchor_137:1_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_137:1_677" class="fnanchor">[137:1]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, we see the <i>first</i> budding out of&mdash;what was termed by the
<i>true</i> followers of Jesus&mdash;<i>heretical doctrines</i>. The time had not yet
come to make Jesus <i>a god</i>, to claim that he had been born of a virgin.
As he <i>must</i>, however, have been different from other
mortals&mdash;throughout the period of his ministry, at least&mdash;the Christ
<i>must</i> have entered into him at the time of his baptism, and <i>as
mysteriously</i> disappeared when he was delivered into the hands of the
Jews.</p>

<p>In the course of time, the seeds of the faith, which had slowly arisen
in the rocky and ungrateful soil of Judea, were transplanted, in full
maturity, to the happier climes of the <i>Gentiles</i>; and the strangers of
<i>Rome</i> and <i>Alexandria, who had never beheld the manhood</i>, were more
ready to embrace the <i>divinity</i> of Jesus.</p>

<p>The polytheist and the philosopher, the Greek and the barbarian, were
alike accustomed to receive&mdash;as we have seen in this chapter&mdash;a long
succession and infinite chain of angels, or deities, or <i>&aelig;ons</i>, or
emanations, issuing from the throne of light. Nor could it seem strange
and incredible <i>to them</i>, that the first of the <i>&aelig;ons</i>, the Logos, or
Word of God, of the same substance with the Father, should descend upon
earth, to deliver the human race from vice and error. The histories of
their countries, their odes, and their religions were teeming with such
ideas, as happening in the past, and they were also <i>looking for and
expecting an Angel-Messiah</i>.<a name="FNanchor_137:2_678" id="FNanchor_137:2_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_137:2_678" class="fnanchor">[137:2]</a></p>

<p>Centuries rolled by, however, before the doctrine of Christ Jesus, the
Angel-Messiah, became a settled question, an established tenet in the
Christian faith. The dignity of Christ Jesus was measured by <i>private
judgment</i>, according to the indefinite <i>rule of Scripture</i>, or
<i>tradition</i> or <i>reason</i>. But when his pure and proper divinity had been
established <i>on the ruins of Arianism</i>, the faith of the Catholics
trembled <i>on the edge of a precipice</i> where it was impossible to recede,
dangerous to stand, dreadful to fall; and the <i>manifold inconveniences
of their creed</i> were aggravated by the sublime character of their
theology. They hesitated to pronounce that <i>God himself</i>, the second
person of an equal and consubstantial Trinity, was <i>manifested in the
flesh</i>,<a name="FNanchor_137:3_679" id="FNanchor_137:3_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_137:3_679" class="fnanchor">[137:3]</a> that the Being who pervades the universe <i>had been
confined in the womb of Mary</i>; that his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>eternal duration had been
marked by the days, and months, and years of human existence; <i>that the
Almighty God had been scourged and crucified</i>; that his impassible
essence <i>had felt pain and anguish</i>; that his omniscience was <i>not
exempt from ignorance</i>; and that <i>the source of life and immortality
expired on Mount Calvary</i>.</p>

<p>These alarming consequences were affirmed with unblushing simplicity by
Apollinaris, Bishop of Laodicea, and one of the luminaries of the
Church. The son of a learned grammarian, he was skilled in all the
sciences of Greece; eloquence, erudition, and philosophy, conspicuous in
the volumes of Apollinaris, were humbly devoted to the service of
religion.</p>

<p>The worthy friend of Athanasius, the worthy antagonist of Julian, he
bravely wrestled with the Arians and polytheists, <i>and though he
affected the rigor of geometrical demonstration</i>, his commentaries
revealed the literal and allegorical sense of the Scriptures.</p>

<p><i>A mystery</i>, which had long floated in the looseness of popular belief,
was defined by his perverse diligence in a technical form, <i>and he first
proclaimed the memorable words, "One incarnate nature of
Christ.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_138:1_680" id="FNanchor_138:1_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_138:1_680" class="fnanchor">[138:1]</a></p>

<p>This was about <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 362, he being Bishop of Laodicea, in Syria, at that
time.<a name="FNanchor_138:2_681" id="FNanchor_138:2_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_138:2_681" class="fnanchor">[138:2]</a></p>

<p>The recent zeal against the errors of Apollinaris reduced the Catholics
to a seeming agreement with the <i>double-nature</i> of Cerinthus. But
instead of a temporary and occasional alliance, they established, and
Christians <i>still embrace</i>, the substantial, indissoluble, and
everlasting <i>union of a perfect God with a perfect man</i>, of the second
person of the Trinity with a reasonable soul and human flesh. In the
beginning of the <i>fifth century</i>, the unity of the two natures was the
prevailing doctrine of the church.<a name="FNanchor_138:3_682" id="FNanchor_138:3_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_138:3_682" class="fnanchor">[138:3]</a> From that time, until a
comparatively recent period, the cry was: "<i>May those who divide
Christ<a name="FNanchor_138:4_683" id="FNanchor_138:4_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_138:4_683" class="fnanchor">[138:4]</a> be divided with the sword; may <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>they be hewn in pieces,
may they be burned alive!</i>" These were actually the words of a
<i>Christian</i> synod.<a name="FNanchor_139:1_684" id="FNanchor_139:1_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_139:1_684" class="fnanchor">[139:1]</a> Is it any wonder that after this came the
<i>dark ages</i>? How appropriate is the name which has been applied to the
centuries which followed! <i>Dark</i> indeed they were. Now and then,
however, a ray of light was seen, which gave evidence of the coming
<i>morn</i>, whose glorious light we now enjoy. But what a grand light is yet
to come from the noon-day sun, which must shed its glorious rays over
the whole earth, ere it sets.</p>

was born of a virgin, as Christ is related to have been born of her (See
<i>note</i> to the "Gospel of the Birth of Mary" [Apocryphal]; also King: The
Gnostics and their Remains, p. 91, and Gibbon's Hist. of Rome, vol. v.
p. 108, <i>note</i>). This idea has been recently adopted by the Roman
Catholic Church. They now claim that Mary was born as immaculate as her
son. (See Inman's Ancient Faiths, vol. i. p. 75, and The Lily of Israel,
pp. 6-15; also <a href="#Fig_17">fig. 17</a>, ch. xxxii.)</p>

<p>"The gradual <i>deification</i> of Mary, though slower in its progress,
follows, in the Romish Church, a course analogous to that which the
Church of the first centuries followed, in elaborating the deity of
Jesus. With almost all the Catholic writers of our day, Mary is the
universal mediatrix; <i>all power has been given to her in heaven and upon
earth</i>. Indeed, more than one serious attempt has been already made in
the Ultramontane camp to unite Mary in some way to the <i>Trinity</i>; and if
Mariolatry lasts much longer, this will probably be accomplished in the
end." (Albert R&eacute;ville.)</p></div>

<p>"The passages which appear most confirmatory of Christ's Deity, or
Divine nature, are, in the first place, the narratives of the
Incarnation and of the Miraculous Conception, as given by Matthew and
Luke. Now, the two narratives do not harmonize with each other; they
neutralize and negative the <i>genealogies</i> on which depend so large a
portion of the proof of Jesus being the Messiah&mdash;the marvellous
statement they contain is not referred to in any subsequent portion of
the two Gospels, and is tacitly but positively negatived by several
passages&mdash;it is never mentioned in the Acts or in the Epistles, and was
evidently unknown to all the Apostles&mdash;and, finally, the tone of the
narrative, especially in Luke, is poetical and legendary, and bears a
marked similarity to the stories contained in the Apocryphal Gospels."

<h3>THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM.</h3>

<p>Being born in a miraculous manner, as other great personages had been,
it was necessary that the miracles attending the births of these
virgin-born gods should be added to the history of Christ Jesus,
otherwise the legend would not be complete.</p>

<p>The first which we shall notice is the story of the <i>star</i> which is said
to have heralded his birth, and which was designated "<i>his</i> star." It is
related by the <i>Matthew</i> narrator as follows:<a name="FNanchor_140:1_685" id="FNanchor_140:1_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_140:1_685" class="fnanchor">[140:1]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When Jesus was born in Bethlehem, of Judea, in the days of
Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to
Jerusalem, saying: 'Where is he that is born King of the Jews?
for we have seen <i>his star</i> in the east, and are come to
worship him.'"</p></div>

<p>Herod the king, having heard these things, he privately called the wise
men, and inquired of them what time the star appeared, at the same time
sending them to Bethlehem to search diligently for the young child. The
wise men, accordingly, departed and went on their way towards Bethlehem.
"The star which they saw in the east went before them, till it came <i>and
stood over</i> where the young child was."</p>

<p>The general legendary character of this narrative&mdash;its similarity in
style with those contained in the apocryphal gospels&mdash;and more
especially its conformity with those <i>astrological notions</i> which,
though prevalent in the time of the Matthew narrator, have been exploded
by the sounder scientific knowledge of our days&mdash;all unite to stamp upon
the story the impress of poetic or mythic fiction.</p>

<p>The fact that the writer of this story speaks not of <i>a star</i> but of
<i>his star</i>, shows that it was the popular belief of the people among
whom he lived, that each and every person was born under a star, and
that this one which had been seen was <i>his star</i>.</p>

<p>All ancient nations were very superstitious in regard to the influence
of the stars upon human affairs, and this ridiculous idea <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>has been
handed down, in some places, even to the present day. Dr. Hooykaas,
speaking on this subject, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In ancient times the Jews, like other peoples, might very
well believe that there was some immediate connection between
the stars and the life of man&mdash;an idea which we still preserve
in the forms of speech that so-and-so was born under a lucky
or under an evil star. They might therefore suppose that the
birth of <ins class="corr" title="original has greatmen">great men</ins>, such as Abraham, for instance, was
announced in the heavens. In our century, however, if not
before, all serious belief in astrology has ceased, and it
would be regarded as an act of the grossest superstition for
any one to have his horoscope drawn; for the course, the
appearance and the disappearance of the heavenly bodies have
been long determined with mathematical precision by
science."<a name="FNanchor_141:1_686" id="FNanchor_141:1_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_141:1_686" class="fnanchor">[141:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Geikie says, in his <i>Life of Christ</i>:<a name="FNanchor_141:2_687" id="FNanchor_141:2_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_141:2_687" class="fnanchor">[141:2]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Jews had already, long before Christ's day, dabbled in
astrology, and the various forms of magic which became
connected with it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They were much given to cast horoscopes
from the numerical value of a name. Everywhere throughout the
whole Roman Empire, Jewish magicians, dream expounders, and
sorcerers, were found.</p>

<p>"'The life and portion of children,' says the <i>Talmud</i>, 'hang
not on righteousness, but on <i>their</i> star.' 'The planet of the
day has no virtue, but the planet of the hour (of nativity)
has much.' 'When the Messiah is to be revealed,' says the book
<i>Sohar</i>, 'a star will rise in the east, shining in great
brightness, and <i>seven</i> other stars round it will fight
against it on every side.' 'A star will rise in the east,
which is the star of the Messiah, and will remain in the east
fifteen days.'"</p></div>

<p>The moment of every man's birth being supposed to determine every
circumstance in his life, it was only necessary to find out in what mode
the <i>celestial bodies</i>&mdash;supposed to be the primary wheels to the
universal machine&mdash;operated at that moment, in order to discover all
that would happen to him afterward.</p>

<p>The regularity of the risings and settings of the fixed stars, though it
announced the changes of the seasons and the orderly variations of
nature, could not be adapted to the capricious mutability of human
actions, fortunes, and adventures: wherefore the astrologers had
recourse to the planets, whose more complicated revolutions offered more
varied and more extended combinations. Their different returns to
certain points of the Zodiac, their relative positions and conjunctions
with each other, were supposed to influence the affairs of men; whence
daring impostors presumed to foretell, not only the destinies of
individuals, but also the rise and fall of empires, and the fate of the
world itself.<a name="FNanchor_141:3_688" id="FNanchor_141:3_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_141:3_688" class="fnanchor">[141:3]</a></p>

<p>The inhabitants of <i>India</i> are, and have always been, very superstitious
concerning the stars. The Rev. D. O. Allen, who resided <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>in India for
twenty-five years, and who undoubtedly became thoroughly acquainted with
the superstitions of the inhabitants, says on this subject:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"So strong are the superstitious feelings of many, concerning
the supposed influence of the stars on human affairs, that
some days are <i>lucky</i>, and others again are <i>unlucky</i>, that no
arguments or promises would induce them to deviate from the
course which these <i>stars</i>, signs, &amp;c., indicate, as the way
of safety, prosperity, and happiness. The evils and
inconveniences of these superstitions and prejudices are among
the things that press heavily upon the people of
India."<a name="FNanchor_142:1_689" id="FNanchor_142:1_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_142:1_689" class="fnanchor">[142:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The <i>Nakshatias</i>&mdash;twenty-seven constellations which in Indian astronomy
separate the moon's path into twenty-seven divisions, as the signs of
the Zodiac do that of the sun into twelve&mdash;are regarded as deities who
exert a vast influence on the destiny of men, not only at the moment of
their entrance into the world, but during their whole passage through
it. These formidable constellations are consulted at births, marriages,
and on all occasions of family rejoicing, distress or calamity. No one
undertakes a journey or any important matter except on days which the
aspect of the Nakshatias renders lucky and auspicious. If any
constellation is unfavorable, it must by all means be propitiated by a
ceremony called S'anti.</p>

<p>The <i>Chinese</i> were very superstitious concerning the stars. They
annually published astronomical calculations of the motions of the
planets, for every hour and minute of the year. They considered it
important to be very exact, because the hours, and even the minutes, are
lucky or unlucky, according to the aspect of the stars. Some days were
considered peculiarly fortunate for marrying, or beginning to build a
house; and the gods are better pleased with sacrifice offered at certain
hours than they are with the same ceremony performed at other
times.<a name="FNanchor_142:2_690" id="FNanchor_142:2_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_142:2_690" class="fnanchor">[142:2]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Persians</i> were also great astrologers, and held the stars
in great reverence. They believed and taught that the destinies of men
were intimately connected with their motions, and therefore it was
important to know under the influence of what star a human soul made its
advent into this world. Astrologers swarmed throughout the country, and
were consulted upon all important occasions.<a name="FNanchor_142:3_691" id="FNanchor_142:3_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_142:3_691" class="fnanchor">[142:3]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Egyptians</i> were exactly the same in this respect. According
to Champollion, the tomb of Ramses V., at Thebes, contains tables of the
constellations, and of their influence on human beings, for every hour
of every month of the year.<a name="FNanchor_142:4_692" id="FNanchor_142:4_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_142:4_692" class="fnanchor">[142:4]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p><p>The Buddhists' sacred books relate that the birth of <i>Buddha</i> was
announced in the heavens by an <i><ins class="corr" title="[original asterim]">asterism</ins></i> which was seen rising on the
horizon. It is called the "<i>Messianic star</i>."<a name="FNanchor_143:1_693" id="FNanchor_143:1_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_143:1_693" class="fnanchor">[143:1]</a></p>

<p>The Fo-pen-hing says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The time of B&ocirc;dhisatwa's incarnation is, when the
constellation <i>Kwei</i> is in conjunction with the Sun."<a name="FNanchor_143:2_694" id="FNanchor_143:2_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_143:2_694" class="fnanchor">[143:2]</a></p></div>

<p>"Wise men," known as "Holy Rishis," were informed by these celestial
signs that the Messiah was born.<a name="FNanchor_143:3_695" id="FNanchor_143:3_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_143:3_695" class="fnanchor">[143:3]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>R&#257;m&#257;yana</i> (one of the sacred books of the Hindoos) the
horoscope of Rama's birth is given. He is said to have been born on the
9th Tithi of the month Caitra. <i>The planet Jupiter</i> figured at his
birth; it being in Cancer at that time.<a name="FNanchor_143:4_696" id="FNanchor_143:4_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_143:4_696" class="fnanchor">[143:4]</a> Rama was an incarnation
of Vishnu. When <i>Crishna</i> was born "<i>his stars</i>" were to be seen in the
heavens. They were pointed out by one Nared, a great prophet and
astrologer.<a name="FNanchor_143:5_697" id="FNanchor_143:5_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_143:5_697" class="fnanchor">[143:5]</a></p>

<p>Without going through the list, we can say that the birth of every
Indian <i>Avatar</i> was foretold by <i>celestial signs</i>.<a name="FNanchor_143:6_698" id="FNanchor_143:6_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_143:6_698" class="fnanchor">[143:6]</a></p>

<p>The same myth is to be found in the legends of China. Among others they
relate that a star figured at the birth of <i>Yu</i>, the founder of the
first dynasty which reigned in China,<a name="FNanchor_143:7_699" id="FNanchor_143:7_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_143:7_699" class="fnanchor">[143:7]</a> who&mdash;as we saw in the last
chapter&mdash;was of heavenly origin, having been born of a virgin. It is
also said that a star figured at the birth of <i>Laou-tsze</i>, the Chinese
sage.<a name="FNanchor_143:8_700" id="FNanchor_143:8_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_143:8_700" class="fnanchor">[143:8]</a></p>

<p>In the legends of the Jewish patriarchs and prophets, it is stated that
a <i>brilliant star</i> shone at the time of the birth of <i>Moses</i>. It was
seen by the <i>Magi</i> of Egypt, who immediately informed the king.<a name="FNanchor_143:9_701" id="FNanchor_143:9_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_143:9_701" class="fnanchor">[143:9]</a></p>

<p>When <i>Abraham</i> was born "<i>his star</i>" shone in the heavens, if we may
believe the popular legends, and its brilliancy outshone all the other
stars.<a name="FNanchor_143:10_702" id="FNanchor_143:10_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_143:10_702" class="fnanchor">[143:10]</a> Rabbinic traditions relate the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Abraham was the son of Terah, general of Nimrod's army. He
was born at Ur of the Chaldees 1948 years after the Creation.
On the night of his birth, Terah's friends&mdash;among whom were
many of Nimrod's councillors and soothsayers&mdash;were feasting in
his house. On leaving, late at night, <i>they observed an
unusual star in the east</i>, it seemed to run from one quarter
of the heavens to the other, and to devour four stars which
were there. All amazed in astonishment <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>at this wondrous
sight, 'Truly,' said they, '<i>this can signify nothing else but
that Terah's new-born son will become great and
powerful</i>.'"<a name="FNanchor_144:1_703" id="FNanchor_144:1_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_144:1_703" class="fnanchor">[144:1]</a></p></div>

<p>It is also related that Nimrod, in a dream, saw a star rising above the
horizon, which was very brilliant. The soothsayers being consulted in
regard to it, foretold that a child was born who would become a great
prince.<a name="FNanchor_144:2_704" id="FNanchor_144:2_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_144:2_704" class="fnanchor">[144:2]</a></p>

<p>A brilliant star, which eclipsed all the other stars, was also to be
seen at the birth of the C&aelig;sars; in fact, as Canon Farrar remarks, "The
Greeks and Romans had <i>always</i> considered that the births and deaths of
great men were symbolized by the appearance and disappearance of
heavenly bodies, and the same belief has continued down to comparatively
modern times."<a name="FNanchor_144:3_705" id="FNanchor_144:3_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_144:3_705" class="fnanchor">[144:3]</a></p>

<p>Tacitus, the Roman historian, speaking of the reign of the Emperor Nero,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A comet having appeared, in this juncture, the phenomenon,
according to the <i>popular opinion</i>, announced that governments
were to be changed, and kings dethroned. In the imaginations
of men, Nero was already dethroned, and who should be his
successor was the question."<a name="FNanchor_144:4_706" id="FNanchor_144:4_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_144:4_706" class="fnanchor">[144:4]</a></p></div>

<p>According to Moslem authorities, the birth of <i>Ali</i>&mdash;Mohammed's great
disciple, and the chief of one of the two principal sects into which
Islam is divided&mdash;was foretold by celestial signs. "A light was
distinctly visible, resembling a bright column, extending from the earth
to the firmament."<a name="FNanchor_144:5_707" id="FNanchor_144:5_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_144:5_707" class="fnanchor">[144:5]</a> Even during the reign of the Emperor Hadrian,
a hundred years after the time assigned for the death of Jesus, a
certain Jew who gave himself out as the "<i>Messiah</i>," and headed the last
great insurrection of his country, assumed the name of
<i>Bar-Cochba</i>&mdash;that is, "<i>Son of a Star</i>."<a name="FNanchor_144:6_708" id="FNanchor_144:6_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_144:6_708" class="fnanchor">[144:6]</a></p>

<p>This myth evidently extended to the New World, as we find that the
symbol of <i>Quetzalcoatle</i>, the virgin-born Saviour, was the "<i>Morning
Star</i>."<a name="FNanchor_144:7_709" id="FNanchor_144:7_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_144:7_709" class="fnanchor">[144:7]</a></p>

<p>We see, then, that among the ancients there seems to have been a very
general idea that the birth of a great person would be announced by a
star. The Rev. Dr. Geikie, who maintains to his utmost the truth of the
Gospel narrative, is yet constrained to admit that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was, indeed, universally believed, that extraordinary
events, especially <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>the birth and death of great men, were
heralded by appearances of stars, and still more of comets, or
by conjunctions of the heavenly bodies."<a name="FNanchor_145:1_710" id="FNanchor_145:1_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_145:1_710" class="fnanchor">[145:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The whole tenor of the narrative recorded by the <i>Matthew</i> narrator is
the most complete justification of the science of <i>astrology</i>; that the
first intimation of the birth of the Son of God was given to the
worshipers of Ormuzd, who have the power of distinguishing with
certainty <i>his</i> peculiar star; that from these <i>heathen</i> the tidings of
his birth are received by the Jews at Jerusalem, <i>and therefore that the
theory must be right which connects great events in the life of men with
phenomena in the starry heavens</i>.</p>

<p>If this <i>divine sanction of astrology</i> is contested on the ground that
this was an <i>exceptional</i> event, in which, simply to bring the Magi to
Jerusalem, God caused the star to appear in accordance with their
superstitious science, the difficulty is only pushed one degree
backwards, for in this case God, it is asserted, wrought an event which
was perfectly certain to strengthen the belief of the Magi, of Herod, of
the Jewish priests, and of the Jews generally, in the truth of
astrology.</p>

<p>If, to avoid the alternative, recourse be had to the notion that the
star appeared <i>by chance</i>, or that this <i>chance</i> or <i>accident</i> directed
the Magi aright, is the position really improved? Is <i>chance</i> consistent
with any notion of supernatural interposition?</p>

<p>We may also ask the question, why were the Magi brought to Jerusalem at
all? If they knew that the star which they saw was the star of Christ
Jesus&mdash;as the narrative states<a name="FNanchor_145:2_711" id="FNanchor_145:2_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_145:2_711" class="fnanchor">[145:2]</a>&mdash;and were by this knowledge
conducted to Jerusalem, why did it not suffice to guide them <i>straight
to Bethlehem</i>, and thus prevent the Slaughter of the Innocents? Why did
the star desert them after its first appearance, not to be seen again
till they issued from Jerusalem? or, if it did not desert them, why did
they ask of Herod and the priests the road which they should take, when,
by the hypothesis, the star was ready to guide them?<a name="FNanchor_145:3_712" id="FNanchor_145:3_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_145:3_712" class="fnanchor">[145:3]</a></p>

<p>It is said that in the oracles of Zoroaster there is to be found a
prophecy to the effect that, <i>in the latter days</i>, a virgin would
conceive and bear a son, and that, at the time of his birth, a star
would shine at noonday. Christian divines have seen in this a prophecy
of the birth of <i>Christ</i> Jesus, but when critically examined, it does
not stand the test. The drift of the story is this:</p>

<p>Ormuzd, the Lord of Light, who created the universe in <i>six</i> periods of
time, accomplished his work by making the first man <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>and woman, and
infusing into them the breath of life. It was not long before Ahriman,
the evil one, contrived to seduce the first parents of mankind by
<ins class="corr" title="original has pursuading">persuading</ins> them to eat of the forbidden fruit. Sin and death are now in
the world; the principles of <i>good</i> and <i>evil</i> are now in deadly strife.
Ormuzd then reveals to mankind his <i>law</i> through his prophet Zoroaster;
the strife between the two principles continues, however, and will
continue until the end of a destined term. During the last three
thousand years of the period Ahriman is predominant. The world now
hastens to its doom; religion and virtue are nowhere to be found;
mankind are plunged in sin and misery. <i>Sosiosh</i> is born of a virgin,
and redeems them, subdues the Devs, awakens the dead, <i>and holds the
last judgment</i>. A comet sets the world in flames; the Genii of Light
combat against the Genii of Darkness, and cast them into Duzakh, where
Ahriman and the Devs and the souls of the wicked are thoroughly cleansed
and purified by fire. Ahriman then submits to Ormuzd; evil is absorbed
into goodness; the unrighteous, thoroughly purified, are united with the
righteous, and <i>a new earth and a new heaven</i> arise, free from all evil,
where peace and innocence will forever dwell.</p>

<p>Who can fail to see that this virgin-born <i>Sosiosh</i> was to come, <i>not
eighteen hundred years ago</i>, but, in the "<i>latter days</i>," when the world
is to be set on fire by a <i>comet</i>, the <i>judgment</i> to take place, and the
"new heaven and new earth" is to be established? Who can fail to see
also, by a perusal of the New Testament, that the idea of a <i>temporal
Messiah</i> (a mighty king and warrior, who should liberate and rule over
his people Israel), and the idea of an <i>Angel-Messiah</i> (who had come to
announce that the "kingdom of heaven was at hand," that the "stars
should fall from heaven," and that all men would shortly be judged
according to their deeds), are both jumbled together in a heap?</p>

<h3>THE SONG OF THE HEAVENLY HOST.</h3>

<p>The story of the Song of the Heavenly Host belongs exclusively to the
<i>Luke</i> narrator, and, in substance, is as follows:</p>

<p>At the time of the birth of Christ Jesus, there were shepherds abiding
in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. And the angel of
the Lord appeared among them, and the glory of the Lord shone round
about them, and the angel said: "I bring you good tidings of great joy,
which shall be to all people; for unto you is born this day in the city
of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord."</p>

<p>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly Host,
praising God in song, saying: "Glory to God in the highest; and on earth
peace, good will towards men." After this the angels went <i>into
heaven</i>.<a name="FNanchor_147:1_713" id="FNanchor_147:1_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_147:1_713" class="fnanchor">[147:1]</a></p>

<p>It is recorded in the <i>Vishnu Purana</i><a name="FNanchor_147:2_714" id="FNanchor_147:2_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_147:2_714" class="fnanchor">[147:2]</a> that while the virgin
Devaki bore <i>Crishna</i>, "the protector of the world," in her womb, she
was eulogized by the gods, and on the day of Crishna's birth, "the
quarters of the horizon were irradiate with joy, as if moonlight was
diffused over the whole earth." "<i>The spirits and the nymphs of heaven
danced and sang</i>," and, "at <i>midnight</i>,<a name="FNanchor_147:3_715" id="FNanchor_147:3_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_147:3_715" class="fnanchor">[147:3]</a> when the support of all
was born, <i>the clouds emitted low pleasing sounds, and poured down rain
of flowers</i>."<a name="FNanchor_147:4_716" id="FNanchor_147:4_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_147:4_716" class="fnanchor">[147:4]</a></p>

<p>Similar demonstrations of celestial delight were not wanting at the
birth of <i>Buddha</i>. All beings everywhere were full of joy. Music was to
be heard all over the land, and, as in the case of Crishna, there fell
from the skies a gentle shower of flowers and perfumes. Caressing
breezes blew, and a marvellous light was produced.<a name="FNanchor_147:5_717" id="FNanchor_147:5_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_147:5_717" class="fnanchor">[147:5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p><p>The Fo-pen-hing relates that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The attending spirits, who surrounded the Virgin Maya and the
infant Saviour, singing praises of 'the Blessed One,' said:
'All joy be to you, Queen Maya, rejoice and be glad, for the
child you have borne is holy.' Then the Rishis and Devas who
dwelt on earth exclaimed with great joy: 'This day Buddha is
born for the good of men, to dispel the darkness of their
ignorance.' Then the four heavenly kings took up the strain
and said: 'Now because B&ocirc;dhisatwa is born, to give joy and
bring peace to the world, therefore is there this brightness.'
Then the gods of the thirty-three heavens took up the burden
of the strain, and the Yama Devas and the T&ucirc;sita Devas, and so
forth, through all the heavens of the Kama, Rupa, and Arupa
worlds, even up to the Akanishta heavens, all the Devas joined
in this song, and said: '<i>To-day B&ocirc;dhisatwa is born on earth,
to give joy and peace to men and Devas, to shed light in the
dark places, and to give sight to the blind.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_148:1_718" id="FNanchor_148:1_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_148:1_718" class="fnanchor">[148:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Even the sober philosopher <i>Confucius</i> did not enter the world, if we
may believe Chinese tradition, without premonitory symptoms of his
greatness.<a name="FNanchor_148:2_719" id="FNanchor_148:2_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_148:2_719" class="fnanchor">[148:2]</a></p>

<p>Sir John Francis Davis, speaking of Confucius, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Various prodigies, <i>as in other instances</i>, were the
forerunners of the birth of this extraordinary person. On the
eve of his appearance upon earth, <i>celestial music</i> sounded in
the ears of his mother; and when he was born, this inscription
appeared on his breast: 'The maker of a rule for setting the
World.'"<a name="FNanchor_148:3_720" id="FNanchor_148:3_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_148:3_720" class="fnanchor">[148:3]</a></p></div>

<p>In the case of <i>Osiris</i>, the Egyptian Saviour, at his birth, a voice was
heard proclaiming that: "The Ruler of all the Earth is born."<a name="FNanchor_148:4_721" id="FNanchor_148:4_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_148:4_721" class="fnanchor">[148:4]</a></p>

<p>In Plutarch's "<i>Isis</i>" occurs the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"At the birth of Osiris, there was heard a voice that the Lord
of all the Earth was coming in being; and some say that a
woman named Pamgle, as she was going to carry water to the
temple of Ammon, in the city of Thebes, heard that voice,
which commanded her to proclaim it with a loud voice, that the
great beneficent god Osiris was born."<a name="FNanchor_148:5_722" id="FNanchor_148:5_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_148:5_722" class="fnanchor">[148:5]</a></p></div>

<p>Wonderful demonstrations of delight also attended the birth of the
heavenly-born <i>Apollonius</i>. According to Flavius Philostratus, who wrote
the life of this remarkable man, a flock of swans surrounded his mother,
and clapping their wings, as is their custom, they sang in unison, while
the air was fanned by gentle breezes.</p>

<p>When the god <i>Apollo</i> was born of the virgin Latona in the Island of
Delos, there was joy among the undying gods in Olympus, and the Earth
laughed beneath the smile of Heaven.<a name="FNanchor_148:6_723" id="FNanchor_148:6_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_148:6_723" class="fnanchor">[148:6]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p><p>At the time of the birth of "<i>Hercules the Saviour</i>," his father Zeus,
the god of gods, spake from heaven and said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This day shall a child be born of the race of Perseus, who
shall be the mightiest of the sons of men."<a name="FNanchor_149:1_724" id="FNanchor_149:1_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_149:1_724" class="fnanchor">[149:1]</a></p></div>

<p>When <i>&AElig;sculapius</i> was a helpless infant, and when he was about to be put
to death, a voice from the god Apollo was heard, saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Slay not the child with the mother; <i>he is born to do great
things</i>; but bear him to the wise centaur Cheiron, and bid him
train the boy in all his wisdom and teach him to do brave
deeds, that men may praise his name in the generations that
shall be hereafter."<a name="FNanchor_149:2_725" id="FNanchor_149:2_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_149:2_725" class="fnanchor">[149:2]</a></p></div>

<p>As we stated above, the story of the Song of the Heavenly Host belongs
exclusively to the <i>Luke</i> narrator; none of the other writers of the
synoptic Gospels know anything about it, which, if it really happened,
seems very strange.</p>

<p>If the reader will turn to the apocryphal Gospel called
<ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins><i>Protevangelion</i>" (chapter xiii.), he will there see one of the reasons
why it was thought best to leave this Gospel out of the canon of the New
Testament. It relates the "Miracles at Mary's labor," similar to the
<i>Luke</i> narrator, but in a still more wonderful form. It is probably from
this apocryphal Gospel that the Luke narrator copied.</p>

<h3>THE DIVINE CHILD RECOGNIZED AND PRESENTED WITH GIFTS.</h3>

<p>The next in order of the wonderful events which are related to have
happened at the birth of Christ Jesus, is the recognition of the divine
child, and the presentation of gifts.</p>

<p>We are informed by the <i>Matthew</i> narrator, that being guided by a star,
the <i>Magi</i><a name="FNanchor_150:1_726" id="FNanchor_150:1_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_150:1_726" class="fnanchor">[150:1]</a> from the east came to where the young child was.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And when they were come into the <i>house</i> (not <i>stable</i>) they
saw the young child, with Mary his mother, and fell down and
worshiped him. And when they had opened their treasures, they
presented unto him gifts, gold, frankincense, and
myrrh."<a name="FNanchor_150:2_727" id="FNanchor_150:2_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_150:2_727" class="fnanchor">[150:2]</a></p></div>

<p>The <i>Luke</i> narrator&mdash;who seems to know nothing about the Magi from the
east&mdash;informs us that <i>shepherds</i> came and worshiped the young child.
They were keeping their flocks by night when the angel of the Lord
appeared before them, saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Behold, I bring you good tidings&mdash;for unto you is born this
day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord."</p></div>

<p>After the angel had left them, they said one to another:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Let us go unto Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to
pass, which the Lord hath made known to us. And they came with
haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a
<i>manger</i>."<a name="FNanchor_150:3_728" id="FNanchor_150:3_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_150:3_728" class="fnanchor">[150:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The Luke narrator evidently borrowed this story of the <i>shepherds</i> from
the "<i><a href="#Gospel_of_the_Egyptians">Gospel of the Egyptians</a></i>" (of which we shall speak in another
chapter), or from other sacred records of the biographies of Crishna or
Buddha.</p>

<p>It is related in the legends of <i>Crishna</i> that the divine child <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>was
cradled among shepherds, to whom were first made known the stupendous
feats which stamped his character with marks of the divinity. He was
recognized as the promised <i>Saviour</i> by Nanda, a shepherd, or cowherd,
and his companions, who prostrated themselves before the heaven-born
child. After the birth of Crishna, the Indian prophet Nared, having
heard of his fame, visited his father and mother at Gokool, examined the
stars, &amp;c., and declared him to be of celestial descent.<a name="FNanchor_151:1_729" id="FNanchor_151:1_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_151:1_729" class="fnanchor">[151:1]</a></p>

<p>Not only was Crishna adored by the shepherds and Magi, and received with
<i>divine honors</i>, but he was <i>also presented with gifts</i>. These gifts
were "sandal wood and perfumes."<a name="FNanchor_151:2_730" id="FNanchor_151:2_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_151:2_730" class="fnanchor">[151:2]</a> (Why not "frankincense and
myrrh?")</p>

<p>Similar stories are related of the infant <i>Buddha</i>. He was visited, at
the time of his birth, by <i>wise men</i>, who at once recognized in the
marvellous infant all the characters of the divinity, and he had
scarcely seen the day before he was hailed god of gods.<a name="FNanchor_151:3_731" id="FNanchor_151:3_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_151:3_731" class="fnanchor">[151:3]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"'Mongst the strangers came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grey-haired saint, Asita, one whose ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long closed to earthly things, caught heavenly sounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard at prayer beneath his peepul-tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Devas singing songs at Buddha's birth."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Viscount Amberly, speaking of him, says:<a name="FNanchor_151:4_732" id="FNanchor_151:4_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_151:4_732" class="fnanchor">[151:4]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He was visited and adored by a very eminent <i>Rishi</i>, or
hermit, known as <i>Asita</i>, who predicted his future greatness,
but wept at the thought that he himself was too old to see the
day when the law of salvation would be taught by the infant
whom he had come to contemplate."</p>

<p>"I weep (said Asita), because I am old and stricken in years,
and shall not see all that is about to come to pass. The
Buddha Bhagavat (God Almighty Buddha) comes to the world only
after many kalpas. This bright boy will be Buddha. <i>For the
salvation of the world</i> he will teach the law. He will succor
the old, the sick, the afflicted, the dying. He will release
those who are bound in the meshes of <i>natural corruption</i>. He

<p><i>Rama</i>&mdash;the seventh incarnation of Vishnu for human deliverance from

<p>The birth of <i>Confucius</i> (<span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> 551), like that of all the demi-gods and
saints of antiquity, is fabled to have been attended with allegorical
prodigies, amongst which was the appearance of the <i>Ke-lin</i>, a
miraculous quadruped, prophetic of happiness and virtue, which announced
that the child would be "a king without a throne or territory." <i>Five
celestial sages, or "wise men" entered the house at the time of the
child's birth, whilst vocal and instrumental music filed the
air.</i><a name="FNanchor_152:7_741" id="FNanchor_152:7_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_152:7_741" class="fnanchor">[152:7]</a></p>

<p><i>Mithras</i>, the Persian Saviour, and mediator between God and man, was
also visited by "wise men" called Magi, at the time of his birth.<a name="FNanchor_152:8_742" id="FNanchor_152:8_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_152:8_742" class="fnanchor">[152:8]</a>
He was presented with gifts consisting of gold, frankincense and
myrrh.'<a name="FNanchor_152:9_743" id="FNanchor_152:9_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_152:9_743" class="fnanchor">[152:9]</a></p>

<p>According to Plato, at the birth of <i>Socrates</i> (469 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>) there came
three Magi from the east to worship him, bringing gifts of gold,
frankincense and myrrh.<a name="FNanchor_152:10_744" id="FNanchor_152:10_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_152:10_744" class="fnanchor">[152:10]</a></p>

<p><i>&AElig;sculapius</i>, the virgin-born Saviour, was protected by goatherds (why
not shepherds?), who, upon seeing the child, knew at once that he was
divine. The voice of fame soon published the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>birth of this miraculous
infant, upon which people flocked from all quarters to behold and
worship this heaven-born child.<a name="FNanchor_153:1_745" id="FNanchor_153:1_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_153:1_745" class="fnanchor">[153:1]</a></p>

<p>Many of the Grecian and Roman demi-gods and heroes were either fostered
by or worshiped by shepherds. Amongst these may be mentioned <i>Bacchus</i>,
who was educated among shepherds,<a name="FNanchor_153:2_746" id="FNanchor_153:2_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_153:2_746" class="fnanchor">[153:2]</a> and <i>Romulus</i>, who was found on
the banks of the Tiber, and educated by shepherds.<a name="FNanchor_153:3_747" id="FNanchor_153:3_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_153:3_747" class="fnanchor">[153:3]</a> <i>Paris</i>, son

among them.<a name="FNanchor_153:5_749" id="FNanchor_153:5_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_153:5_749" class="fnanchor">[153:5]</a></p>

<p>Viscount Amberly has well said that: "Prognostications of greatness in
infancy are, indeed, among the stock incidents in the mythical or
semi-mythical lives of eminent persons."</p>

<p>We have seen that the <i>Matthew</i> narrator speaks of the infant Jesus, and
Mary, his mother, being in a "<i>house</i>"&mdash;implying that he had been born
there; and that the <i>Luke</i> narrator speaks of the infant "lying in a
manger"&mdash;implying that he was born in a stable. We will now show that
there is still <i>another</i> story related of the <i>place</i> in which he was
born.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>THE BIRTH-PLACE OF CHRIST JESUS.</h3>

<p>The writer of that portion of the Gospel according to <i>Matthew</i> which
treats of the <i>place</i> in which Jesus was born, implies, as we stated in
our last chapter, that he was born in a <i>house</i>. His words are these:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea <i>in the days of
Herod the king</i>, behold, there came wise men from the east" to
worship him. "And when they were come <i>into the house</i>, they
saw the young child with Mary his mother."<a name="FNanchor_154:1_750" id="FNanchor_154:1_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_154:1_750" class="fnanchor">[154:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The writer of the <i>Luke</i> version implies that he was born in <i>a stable</i>,
as the following statement will show:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The days being accomplished that she (Mary) should be
delivered .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she brought forth her first-born son, and
wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and <i>laid him in a manger</i>,
there being no room for him in the <i>inn</i>."<a name="FNanchor_154:2_751" id="FNanchor_154:2_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_154:2_751" class="fnanchor">[154:2]</a></p></div>

<p>If these accounts were contained in these Gospels in the time of
Eusebius, the first ecclesiastical historian, who flourished during the
Council of Nice (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 327), it is very strange that, in speaking of the
birth of Jesus, he should have omitted even mentioning them, and should
have given an altogether different version. He tells us that Jesus was
neither born in a <i>house</i>, nor in a <i>stable</i>, but in a <i>cave</i>, and that
at the time of Constantine a magnificent temple was erected on the spot,
so that the Christians might worship in the place where their Saviour's
feet had stood.<a name="FNanchor_154:3_752" id="FNanchor_154:3_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_154:3_752" class="fnanchor">[154:3]</a></p>

<p>In the apocryphal Gospel called "<i>Protevangelion</i>," attributed to James,
the brother of Jesus, we are informed that Mary and her husband, being
away from their home in Nazareth, and when within three miles of
Bethlehem, to which city they were going, Mary said to Joseph:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Take me down from the ass, for that which is in me presses to
come forth."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p><p>Joseph, replying, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Whither shall I take thee, <i>for the place is desert</i>?"</p></div>

<p>Then said Mary again to Joseph:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Take me down, for that which is within me mightily presses
me."</p></div>

<p>Joseph then took her down from off the ass, and he found there a <i>cave</i>
and put her into it.</p>

<p>Joseph then left Mary in the cave, and started toward Bethlehem for a
midwife, whom he found and brought back with him. When they neared the
spot a bright cloud overshadowed the cave.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"But on a sudden the cloud became <i>a great light in the cave</i>,
so their eyes could not bear it. But the light gradually
decreased, until the infant appeared and sucked the breast of
his mother."<a name="FNanchor_155:1_753" id="FNanchor_155:1_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_155:1_753" class="fnanchor">[155:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Tertullian (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 200), Jerome (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 375) and other Fathers of the
Church, also state that Jesus was born in a <i>cave</i>, and that the
<i>heathen</i> celebrated, in their day, the birth and <i>Mysteries</i> of their
Lord and Saviour Adonis in this very cave near Bethlehem.<a name="FNanchor_155:2_754" id="FNanchor_155:2_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_155:2_754" class="fnanchor">[155:2]</a></p>

<p>Canon Farrar says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That the actual place of Christ's birth was a <i>cave</i>, is a
very ancient tradition, and this cave used to be shown as the
scene of the event even so early as the time of Justin Martyr
(<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 150)."<a name="FNanchor_155:3_755" id="FNanchor_155:3_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_155:3_755" class="fnanchor">[155:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Mr. King says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The place <i>yet</i> shown as the scene of their (the Magi's)
adoration at Bethlehem is a <i>cave</i>."<a name="FNanchor_155:4_756" id="FNanchor_155:4_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_155:4_756" class="fnanchor">[155:4]</a></p></div>

<p>The Christian ceremonies in the Church of the Nativity at Bethlehem are
celebrated to this day in a <i>cave</i>,<a name="FNanchor_155:5_757" id="FNanchor_155:5_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_155:5_757" class="fnanchor">[155:5]</a> and are undoubtedly nearly
the same as were celebrated, <i>in the same place</i>, in honor of <i>Adonis</i>,
in the time of Tertullian and Jerome; and as are yet celebrated in Rome
every Christmas-day, <i>very early in the morning</i>.</p>

<p>We see, then, that there are <i>three</i> different accounts concerning the
<i>place</i> in which Jesus was born. The first, and evidently true one, was
that which is recorded by the <i>Matthew</i> narrator, namely, that he was
born in a <i>house</i>. The stories about his being born in a <i>stable</i> or in
a <i>cave</i><a name="FNanchor_155:6_758" id="FNanchor_155:6_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_155:6_758" class="fnanchor">[155:6]</a> were later inventions, caused from the desire to place
him in as <i>humble</i> a position as possible in his infancy, and from the
fact that the virgin-born Saviours who had <i>preceded</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>him had almost
all been born in a position the most humiliating&mdash;such as a cave, a
cow-shed, a sheep-fold, &amp;c.&mdash;or had been placed there after birth. This
was a part of the <i>universal mythos</i>. As illustrations we may mention
the following:</p>

<p><i>Crishna</i>, the Hindoo virgin-born Saviour, was born in a <i>cave</i>,<a name="FNanchor_156:1_759" id="FNanchor_156:1_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_156:1_759" class="fnanchor">[156:1]</a>
fostered by an honest <i>herdsman</i>,<a name="FNanchor_156:2_760" id="FNanchor_156:2_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_156:2_760" class="fnanchor">[156:2]</a> and, it is said, placed in a
<i>sheep-fold</i> shortly after his birth.</p>

<p><i>How-Tseih</i>, the Chinese "Son of Heaven," when an infant, was left
unprotected by his mother, but the <i>sheep</i> and <i>oxen</i> protected him with
loving care.<a name="FNanchor_156:3_761" id="FNanchor_156:3_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_156:3_761" class="fnanchor">[156:3]</a></p>

<p><i>Abraham</i>, the Father of Patriarchs, is said to have been <i>born in a
cave</i>.<a name="FNanchor_156:4_762" id="FNanchor_156:4_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_156:4_762" class="fnanchor">[156:4]</a></p>

<p><i>Bacchus</i>, who was the son of God by the virgin Semele, is said to have
been <i>born in a cave</i>, or placed in one shortly after his birth.<a name="FNanchor_156:5_763" id="FNanchor_156:5_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_156:5_763" class="fnanchor">[156:5]</a>
Philostratus, the Greek sophist and rhetorician, says, "the inhabitants
of India had a tradition that Bacchus was born at <i>Nisa</i>, and was
brought up in a <i>cave</i> on Mount Meros."</p>

<p><i>&AElig;sculapius</i>, who was the son of God by the virgin Coronis, was left
exposed, when an infant, on a mountain, where he was found and cared for
by a <i>goatherd</i>.<a name="FNanchor_156:6_764" id="FNanchor_156:6_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_156:6_764" class="fnanchor">[156:6]</a></p>

<p><i>Romulus</i>, who was the son of God by the virgin Rhea-Sylvia, was left
exposed, when an infant, on the banks of the river Tiber, where he was
found and cared for by a <i>shepherd</i>.<a name="FNanchor_156:7_765" id="FNanchor_156:7_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_156:7_765" class="fnanchor">[156:7]</a></p>

<p><i>Adonis</i>, the "Lord" and "Saviour," was placed in a <i>cave</i> shortly after
his birth.<a name="FNanchor_156:8_766" id="FNanchor_156:8_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_156:8_766" class="fnanchor">[156:8]</a></p>

<p><i>Apollo</i> (Phoibos), son of the Almighty Zeus, was born in a cave at
early dawn.<a name="FNanchor_156:9_767" id="FNanchor_156:9_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_156:9_767" class="fnanchor">[156:9]</a></p>

<p><i>Mithras</i>, the Persian Saviour, was born in a <i>cave or grotto</i>,<a name="FNanchor_156:10_768" id="FNanchor_156:10_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_156:10_768" class="fnanchor">[156:10]</a>
at early dawn.</p>

<p><i>Hermes</i>, the son of God by the mortal <i>Maia</i>, was born early in the
morning, in <i>a cave or grotto</i> of the Kyllemian hill.<a name="FNanchor_156:11_769" id="FNanchor_156:11_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_156:11_769" class="fnanchor">[156:11]</a></p>

<p><i>Attys</i>, the god of the Phrygians,<a name="FNanchor_156:12_770" id="FNanchor_156:12_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_156:12_770" class="fnanchor">[156:12]</a> was born in a <i>cave</i> or
grotto.<a name="FNanchor_156:13_771" id="FNanchor_156:13_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_156:13_771" class="fnanchor">[156:13]</a></p>

<p>The <i>object</i> is the same in all of these stories, however they may
differ in detail, which is to place the heaven-born infant in the most
humiliating position in infancy.</p>

<p>We have seen it is recorded that, at the time of the birth <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>of Jesus
"there was a <i>great light</i> in the cave, so that the eyes of Joseph and
the midwife could not bear it." This feature is also represented in
early Christian art. "Early Christian painters have represented the
infant Jesus as welcoming three Kings of the East, <i>and shining as
brilliantly as if covered with phosphuretted oil</i>."<a name="FNanchor_157:1_772" id="FNanchor_157:1_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_157:1_772" class="fnanchor">[157:1]</a> In all
pictures of the Nativity, the light is made to arise from the body of
the infant, and the father and mother are often depicted with glories
round their heads. This too was a part of the old mythos, as we shall
now see.</p>

<p>The moment <i>Crishna</i> was born, his mother became beautiful, and her form
brilliant. The whole cave was splendidly illuminated, being filled with
a <i>heavenly light</i>, and the countenances of his father and his mother
emitted rays of glory.<a name="FNanchor_157:2_773" id="FNanchor_157:2_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_157:2_773" class="fnanchor">[157:2]</a></p>

<p>So likewise, it is recorded that, at the time of the birth of Buddha,
"the Saviour of the World," which, according to one account, took place
in an <i>inn</i>, "<i>a divine light diffused around his person</i>," so that "the
Blessed One" was "heralded into the world by a supernatural
light."<a name="FNanchor_157:3_774" id="FNanchor_157:3_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_157:3_774" class="fnanchor">[157:3]</a></p>

<p>When <i>Bacchus</i> was born, a <i>bright light</i> shone round him,<a name="FNanchor_157:4_775" id="FNanchor_157:4_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_157:4_775" class="fnanchor">[157:4]</a> so
that, "<i>there was a brilliant light in the cave</i>."</p>

<p>When <i>Apollo</i> was born, <i>a halo of serene light encircled his cradle</i>,
the nymphs of heaven attended, and bathed him in pure water, and girded
a broad golden band around his form.<a name="FNanchor_157:5_776" id="FNanchor_157:5_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_157:5_776" class="fnanchor">[157:5]</a></p>

<p>When the Saviour <i>&AElig;sculapius</i> was born, his countenance shone like the
sun, and he was surrounded by a fiery ray.<a name="FNanchor_157:6_777" id="FNanchor_157:6_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_157:6_777" class="fnanchor">[157:6]</a></p>

<p>In the life of <i>Zoroaster</i> the common mythos is apparent. He was born in
innocence of an immaculate conception of a Ray of the Divine Reason. As
soon as he was born, <i>the glory arising from his body enlightened the
whole room</i>, and he laughed at his mother.<a name="FNanchor_157:7_778" id="FNanchor_157:7_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_157:7_778" class="fnanchor">[157:7]</a></p>

<p>It is stated in the legends of the Hebrew Patriarchs that, at the birth
of <i>Moses</i>, a bright light appeared and shone around.<a name="FNanchor_157:8_779" id="FNanchor_157:8_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_157:8_779" class="fnanchor">[157:8]</a></p>

<p>There is still another feature which we must notice in these narratives,
that is, the contradictory statements concerning the <i>time</i> when Jesus
was born. As we shall treat of this subject more fully in the chapter on
"The Birthday of Christ Jesus," we shall allude to it here simply as far
as necessary.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p><p>The <i>Matthew</i> narrator informs us that Jesus was born <i>in the days of
Herod the King</i>, and the <i>Luke</i> narrator says he was born <i>when
Cyrenius</i> was <i>Governor of Syria</i>, or later. This is a very awkward and
unfortunate statement, as Cyrenius was not Governor of Syria until some
<i>ten years after the time of Herod</i>.<a name="FNanchor_158:1_780" id="FNanchor_158:1_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_158:1_780" class="fnanchor">[158:1]</a></p>

<p>The cause of this dilemma is owing to the fact that the Luke narrator,
after having interwoven into <i>his</i> story, of the birth of Jesus, the
<i>old myth</i> of the tax or tribute, which is said to have taken place at
the time of the birth of some <i>previous</i> virgin-born Saviours, looked
among the records to see if a taxing had ever taken place in Judea, so
that he might refer to it in support of his statement. He found the
account of the taxing, referred to above, and without stopping to
consider <i>when</i> this taxing took place, or whether or not it would
conflict with the statement that Jesus was born <i>in the days of Herod</i>,
he added to his narrative the words: "And this taxing was <i>first made</i>
when Cyrenius was governor of Syria."<a name="FNanchor_158:2_781" id="FNanchor_158:2_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_158:2_781" class="fnanchor">[158:2]</a></p>

<p>We will now show the ancient myth of the taxing. According to the
<i>Vishnu Purana</i>, when the infant Saviour <i>Crishna</i> was born, his foster
father, <i>Nanda</i>, had come to the city <i>to pay his tax or yearly tribute
to the king</i>. It distinctly speaks of Nanda, and other cowherds,
"<i>bringing tribute or tax to Kansa</i>" the reigning monarch.<a name="FNanchor_158:3_782" id="FNanchor_158:3_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_158:3_782" class="fnanchor">[158:3]</a></p>

<p>It also describes a scene which took place after the taxes had been
paid.</p>

<p>Vasudeva, an acquaintance of Nanda's, "went to the wagon of Nanda, and
found Nanda there, rejoicing that a son (Crishna) had been born to him.</p>

<p>"Vasudeva spoke to him kindly, and congratulated him <i>on having a son in
his old age</i>.<a name="FNanchor_158:4_783" id="FNanchor_158:4_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_158:4_783" class="fnanchor">[158:4]</a></p>

<p>"'Thy yearly tribute,' he added, 'has been paid to the king .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why do
you delay, now that your affairs are settled? Up, Nanda, quickly, and
set off to your own pastures.' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Accordingly Nanda and the other
cowherds returned to their village."<a name="FNanchor_158:5_784" id="FNanchor_158:5_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_158:5_784" class="fnanchor">[158:5]</a></p>

<p>Now, in regard to <i>Buddha</i>, the same myth is found.</p>

<p>Among the thirty-two signs which were to be fulfilled by the mother of
the expected Messiah (Buddha), the fifth sign was recorded to be, "<i>that
she would be on a journey at the time of her <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>child's birth</i>."
Therefore, "that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the
prophets," the virgin Maya, in the tenth month after her heavenly
conception, was on a journey to her father, when lo, the birth of the
Messiah took place under a tree. One account says that "she had alighted
at an <i>inn</i> when Buddha was born."<a name="FNanchor_159:1_785" id="FNanchor_159:1_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_159:1_785" class="fnanchor">[159:1]</a></p>

<p>The mother of <i>Lao-tsze</i>, the Virgin-born Chinese sage, was away from
home when her child was born. She stopped to rest <i>under a tree</i>, and
there, like the virgin Maya, gave birth to her son.<a name="FNanchor_159:2_786" id="FNanchor_159:2_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_159:2_786" class="fnanchor">[159:2]</a></p>

<p><i>Pythagoras</i> (<span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> 570), whose real father was the Holy Ghost,<a name="FNanchor_159:3_787" id="FNanchor_159:3_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_159:3_787" class="fnanchor">[159:3]</a>
was also born at a time when his mother was away from home on a journey.
She was travelling with her husband, who was <i>about his mercantile
concerns</i>, from Samos to Sidon.<a name="FNanchor_159:4_788" id="FNanchor_159:4_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_159:4_788" class="fnanchor">[159:4]</a></p>

<p><i>Apollo</i> was born when his mother was away from home. The Ionian legend
tells the simple tale that Leto, the mother of the unborn Apollo, could
find no place to receive her in her hour of travail until she came to
Delos. The child was born like Buddha and Lao-tsze&mdash;<i>under a
tree</i>.<a name="FNanchor_159:5_789" id="FNanchor_159:5_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_159:5_789" class="fnanchor">[159:5]</a> The mother knew that he was destined to be a being of
mighty power, ruling among the undying gods and mortal men.<a name="FNanchor_159:6_790" id="FNanchor_159:6_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_159:6_790" class="fnanchor">[159:6]</a></p>

<p>Thus we see that the stories, one after another, relating to the birth
and infancy of Jesus, are simply old myths, and are therefore not
historical.</p>

<h3>THE GENEALOGY OF CHRIST JESUS.</h3>

<p>The biographers of Jesus, although they have placed him in a position
the most humiliating in his infancy, and although they have given him
poor and humble parents, have notwithstanding made him to be of <i>royal
descent</i>. The reasons for doing this were twofold. First, because,
according to the Old Testament, the expected Messiah was to be of the
seed of Abraham,<a name="FNanchor_160:1_791" id="FNanchor_160:1_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_160:1_791" class="fnanchor">[160:1]</a> and second, because the Angel-Messiahs who had
previously been on earth to redeem and save mankind had been of <i>royal
descent</i>, therefore Christ Jesus must be so.</p>

<p>The following story, taken from Colebrooke's "<i>Miscellaneous
Essays</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_160:2_792" id="FNanchor_160:2_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_160:2_792" class="fnanchor">[160:2]</a> clearly shows that this idea was general:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The last of the Jinas, Vardham&acirc;na, was <i>at first</i> conceived
by Devanand&#257;, a Brahm&#257;n&#257;. The conception was
announced to her by a dream. Sekra, being apprised of his
incarnation, prostrated himself and worshiped the future saint
(who was in the womb of Devanand&#257;); but reflecting that <i>no
great saint was ever born in an indigent or mendicant family</i>,
as that of a Brahm&#257;n&#257;, Sekra commanded his chief
attendant to remove the child from the womb of Devanand&#257; to
that of Trisala, wife of Siddhartha, <i>a prince of the race of
Jeswaca</i>, of the Kasyapa family."</p></div>

<p>In their attempts to accomplish their object, the biographers of Jesus
have made such poor work of it, that all the ingenuity Christianity has
yet produced, has not been able to repair their blunders.</p>

<p>The genealogies are contained in the first and third Gospels, and
although they do not agree, yet, if either is right, then Jesus was
<i>not</i> the son of God, engendered by the "Holy Ghost," but the legitimate
son of Joseph and Mary. In any other sense they amount to nothing. That
Jesus can be of royal descent, and yet <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>be the Son of God, in the sense
in which these words are used, is a conclusion which can be acceptable
to those only who believe in <i>alleged</i> historical narratives on no other
ground than that they wish them to be true, and dare not call them into
question.</p>

<p>The <i>Matthew</i> narrator states that <i>all</i> the generations from Abraham to
David are <i>fourteen</i>, from David until the carrying away into Babylon
are <i>fourteen</i>, and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Jesus are
<i>fourteen</i> generations.<a name="FNanchor_161:1_793" id="FNanchor_161:1_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_161:1_793" class="fnanchor">[161:1]</a> Surely nothing can have a more
<i>mythological</i> appearance than this. But, when we confine our attention
to the genealogy itself, we find that the generations in the third
stage, including Jesus himself, amount to only <i>thirteen</i>. All attempts
to get over this difficulty have been without success; the genealogies
are, and have always been, hard nuts for theologians to crack. Some of
the early Christian fathers saw this, and they very wisely put an
<i>allegorical</i> interpretation to them.</p>

<p>Dr. South says, in Kitto's Biblical Encyclop&aelig;dia:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Christ's being the true Messiah depends upon his being the
son of David and king of the Jews. <i>So that unless this be
evinced the whole foundation of Christianity must totter and
fall.</i>"</p></div>

<p>Another writer in the same work says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In these two documents (Matthew and Luke), which profess to
give us the genealogy of Christ, there is no notice whatever
of the connection of his only earthly parent with the stock of
David. On the contrary, both the genealogies profess to give
us the descent of Joseph, to connect our Lord with whom by
natural generation, would be to falsify the whole story of his
miraculous birth, and overthrow the Christian faith."</p></div>

<p>Again, when the idea that one of the genealogies is Mary's is spoken of:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"One thing is certain, that our belief in Mary's descent from
David is grounded on inference and tradition and not on any
direct statement of the sacred writings. And there has been a
ceaseless endeavor, both among ancients and moderns, to
gratify the natural cravings for knowledge on this subject."</p></div>

<p>Thomas Scott, speaking of the genealogies, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is a favorite saying with those who seek to defend the
history of the Pentateuch against the scrutiny of modern
criticism, that the objections urged against it were known
long ago. The objections to the <i>genealogy</i> were known long
ago, indeed; and perhaps nothing shows more conclusively than
this knowledge, the disgraceful dishonesty and willful
deception of the most illustrious of Christian
doctors."<a name="FNanchor_161:2_794" id="FNanchor_161:2_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_161:2_794" class="fnanchor">[161:2]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p><p>Referring to the two genealogies, Albert Barnes says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"No two passages of Scripture have caused more difficulty than
these, and various attempts have been made to explain them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Most interpreters have supposed that Matthew gives the
genealogy of Joseph, and Luke that of Mary. <i>But though this
solution is plausible and may be true, yet it wants
evidence.</i>"</p></div>

<p>Barnes furthermore admits the fallibility of the Bible in his remarks
upon the genealogies; 1st, by comparing them to <i>our</i> fallible family
records; and 2d, by the remark that "the only inquiry which can now be
fairly made <i>is whether they copied these tables correctly</i>."</p>

<p>Alford, Ellicott, Hervey, Meyer, Mill, Patritius and Wordsworth hold
that both genealogies are Joseph's; and Aubertin, Ebrard, Greswell,
Kurtz, Lange, Lightfoot and others, hold that one is Joseph's, and the
other Mary's.</p>

<p>When the genealogy contained in <i>Matthew</i> is compared with the Old
Testament <i>they are found to disagree</i>; there are omissions which any
writer with the least claim to historical sense would never have made.</p>

<p>When the genealogy of the <i>third</i> Gospel is turned to, the difficulties
greatly increase, instead of diminish. It not only contradicts the
statements made by the <i>Matthew</i> narrator, but it does not agree with
the Old Testament.</p>

<p>What, <i>according to the three first evangelists</i>, did Jesus think of
himself? In the first place he made no allusion to any miraculous
circumstances connected with his birth. He looked upon himself as
belonging to <i>Nazareth</i>, not as the child of Bethlehem;<a name="FNanchor_162:1_795" id="FNanchor_162:1_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_162:1_795" class="fnanchor">[162:1]</a> <i>he
reproved the scribes for teaching that the Messiah must necessarily be a
descendant of David,<a name="FNanchor_162:2_796" id="FNanchor_162:2_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_162:2_796" class="fnanchor">[162:2]</a> and did not himself make any express claim
to such descent</i>.<a name="FNanchor_162:3_797" id="FNanchor_162:3_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_162:3_797" class="fnanchor">[162:3]</a></p>

<p>As we cannot go into an extended inquiry concerning the genealogies, and
as there is no real necessity for so doing, as many others have already
done so in a masterly manner,<a name="FNanchor_162:4_798" id="FNanchor_162:4_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_162:4_798" class="fnanchor">[162:4]</a> we will continue our investigations
in another direction, and show that Jesus was not the only Messiah who
was claimed to be of royal descent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p><p>To commence with <i>Crishna</i>, the Hindoo Saviour, he was of <i>royal
descent</i>, although born in a state the most abject and
humiliating.<a name="FNanchor_163:1_799" id="FNanchor_163:1_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_163:1_799" class="fnanchor">[163:1]</a> Thomas Maurice says of him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Crishna, in the <i>male</i> line, was of royal descent, being of
the Yadava line, the oldest and noblest of India; and nephew,
by his <i>mother's</i> side, to the reigning sovereign; but, though
royally descended, he was actually born in a state the most
abject and humiliating; and, though not in a stable, yet in a
dungeon."<a name="FNanchor_163:2_800" id="FNanchor_163:2_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_163:2_800" class="fnanchor">[163:2]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Buddha</i> was of <i>royal descent</i>, having descended from the house of
Sakya, the most illustrious of the caste of Brahmans, which reigned in
India over the powerful empire of Mogadha, in the Southern Bahr.<a name="FNanchor_163:3_801" id="FNanchor_163:3_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_163:3_801" class="fnanchor">[163:3]</a></p>

<p>R. Spence Hardy says, in his "Manual of Buddhism:"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The ancestry of Gotama Buddha is traced from his father,
Sodh&oacute;dana, through various individuals and races, all of royal
dignity, to Maha Sammata, the first monarch of the world.
Several of the names, and some of the events, are met with in
the Puranas of the Brahmins, but it is not possible to
reconcile one order of statement with the other; and it would
appear that the Buddhist historians have introduced races, and
invented names, that they may invest their venerated sage with
all the honors of heraldry, in addition to the attributes of
divinity."</p></div>

<p>How remarkably these words compare with what we have just seen
concerning the genealogies of Jesus!</p>

<p><i>Rama</i>, another Indian <i>avatar</i>&mdash;the seventh incarnation of Vishnu&mdash;was

<h3>THE SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTS.</h3>


<p>Interwoven with the miraculous conception and birth of Jesus, the star,
the visit of the Magi, &amp;c., we have a myth which belongs to a common
form, and which, in this instance, is merely adapted to the special
circumstances of the age and place. This has been termed "the myth of
the dangerous child." Its general outline is this: A child is born
concerning whose future greatness some prophetic indications have been
given. But the life of the child is fraught with danger to some powerful
individual, generally a monarch. In alarm at his threatened fate, this
person endeavors to take the child's life, but it is preserved by divine
care.</p>

<p>Escaping the measures directed against it, and generally remaining long
unknown, it at length fulfills the prophecies concerning its career,
while the fate which he has vainly sought to shun falls upon him who had
desired to slay it. There is a departure from the ordinary type, in the
case of Jesus, inasmuch as Herod does not actually die or suffer any
calamity through his agency. But this failure is due to the fact that
Jesus did not fulfill the conditions of the Messiahship, according to
the Jewish conception which Matthew has here in mind. Had he&mdash;as was
expected of the Messiah&mdash;become the actual sovereign of the Jews, he
must have dethroned the reigning dynasty, whether represented by Herod
or his successors. But as his subsequent career belied the expectations,
the evangelist was obliged to postpone to a future time his accession to
that throne of temporal dominion which the incredulity of his countrymen
had withheld from him during his earthly life.</p>

<p>The story of the slaughter of the infants which is said to have taken
place in Judea about the time of the birth of Jesus, is to be found in
the second chapter of <i>Matthew</i>, and is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of
Herod the king, there came wise men from the East to
Jerusalem, saying: 'Where is he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>that is born <i>king of the
Jews</i>? for we have seen <i>his star</i> in the East and have come
to worship him.' When Herod the king had heard these things,
he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him. Then Herod, when
he had privately called the wise men, enquired of them
diligently what time the star appeared. And he sent them to
Bethlehem, and said: 'Go and search diligently for the young
child; and when ye have found him, bring me word.'"</p></div>

<p>The wise men went to Bethlehem and found the young child, but instead of
returning to Herod as he had told them, they departed into their own
country another way, having been warned of God <i>in a dream</i>, that they
should not return to Herod.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men,
was exceeding wroth, <i>and sent forth, and slew all the
children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts
thereof, from two years old and under</i>."</p></div>

<p>We have in this story, told by the <i>Matthew</i> narrator&mdash;which the writers
of the other gospels seem to know nothing about,&mdash;almost a counterpart,
if not an exact one, to that related of <i>Crishna</i> of India, which shows
how closely the mythological history of Jesus has been copied from that
of the Hindoo Saviour.</p>

<p>Joguth Chunder Gangooly, a "Hindoo convert to Christ," tells us, in his
"Life and Religion of the Hindoos," that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A <i>heavenly voice</i> whispered to the foster father of Crishna
and told him to fly with the child across the river Jumna,
which was immediately done.<a name="FNanchor_166:1_811" id="FNanchor_166:1_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_166:1_811" class="fnanchor">[166:1]</a> This was owing to the fact
that the reigning monarch, King Kansa, sought the life of the
infant Saviour, and to accomplish his purpose, he sent
messengers '<i>to kill all the infants in the neighboring
places</i>.'"<a name="FNanchor_166:2_812" id="FNanchor_166:2_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_166:2_812" class="fnanchor">[166:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Mr. Higgins says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Soon after Crishna's birth he was carried away by night and
concealed in a region remote from his natal place, for fear of
a tyrant whose destroyer it was foretold he would become; and
who had, for that reason, ordered all the male children born
at that period to be slain."<a name="FNanchor_166:3_813" id="FNanchor_166:3_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_166:3_813" class="fnanchor">[166:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Sir William Jones says of Crishna:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He passed a life, according to the Indians, of a most
extraordinary and incomprehensible nature. His birth was
concealed through fear of the reigning tyrant Kansa, who, at
the time of his birth, <i>ordered all new-born males to be
slain, yet this wonderful babe was preserved</i>."<a name="FNanchor_166:4_814" id="FNanchor_166:4_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_166:4_814" class="fnanchor">[166:4]</a></p></div>

<p>In the Epic poem Mahabarata, composed more than two thousand years ago,
we have the whole story of this incarnate deity, born of a virgin, and
miraculously escaping in his infancy from the reigning tyrant of his
country, related in its original form.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p><p>Representations of this flight with the babe at midnight are sculptured
on the walls of ancient Hindoo temples.<a name="FNanchor_167:1_815" id="FNanchor_167:1_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_167:1_815" class="fnanchor">[167:1]</a></p>

<p>This story is also the subject of an immense sculpture in the
cave-temple at Elephanta, where the children are represented as being
slain. The date of this sculpture is lost in the most remote antiquity.
It represents a person holding a drawn sword, surrounded by slaughtered
<i>infant boys</i>. Figures of men and women are also represented who are
supposed to be supplicating for their children.<a name="FNanchor_167:2_816" id="FNanchor_167:2_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_167:2_816" class="fnanchor">[167:2]</a></p>

<p>Thomas Maurice, speaking of this sculpture, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The event of Crishna's birth, and the attempt to destroy him,
took place by night, and therefore the shadowy mantle of
darkness, <i>upon which mutilated figures of infants are
engraved</i>, darkness (at once congenial with his crime and the
season of its perpetration), involves the tyrant's bust; the
string of <i>death heads</i> marks the multitude of infants slain
by his savage mandate; and every object in the sculpture
illustrates the events of that Avatar."<a name="FNanchor_167:3_817" id="FNanchor_167:3_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_167:3_817" class="fnanchor">[167:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Another feature which connects these stories is the following:</p>

<p>Sir Wm. Jones tells us that when Crishna was taken out of reach of the
tyrant Kansa who sought to slay him, he was fostered at <i>Mathura</i> by
Nanda, the herdsman;<a name="FNanchor_167:4_818" id="FNanchor_167:4_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_167:4_818" class="fnanchor">[167:4]</a> and Canon Farrar, speaking of the sojourn of
the Holy Family in Egypt, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"St. Matthew neither tells us where the Holy Family abode in
Egypt, nor how long their exile continued; but ancient legends
say that they remained two years absent from Palestine, and
lived at Matar&eacute;&euml;h, a few miles north-east of Cairo."<a name="FNanchor_167:5_819" id="FNanchor_167:5_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_167:5_819" class="fnanchor">[167:5]</a></p></div>

<p>Chemnitius, out of Stipulensis, who had it from Peter Martyr, Bishop of
Alexandria, in the third century, says, that the place in Egypt where
Jesus was banished, is now called Matarea, about ten miles beyond Cairo,
that the inhabitants constantly burn a lamp in remembrance of it, and
that there is a garden of trees yielding a balsam, which was planted by
Jesus when a boy.<a name="FNanchor_167:6_820" id="FNanchor_167:6_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_167:6_820" class="fnanchor">[167:6]</a></p>

<p>Here is evidently one and the same legend.</p>

<p><i>Salivahana</i>, the virgin-born Saviour, anciently worshiped near Cape
Comorin, the southerly part of the Peninsula of India, had the same
history. It was attempted to destroy him in infancy by a tyrant who was
afterward killed by him. Most of the other circumstances, with slight
variations, are the same as those told of Crishna and Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_167:7_821" id="FNanchor_167:7_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_167:7_821" class="fnanchor">[167:7]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p><p><i>Buddha's</i> life was also in danger when an infant. In the southern
country of Magadha, there lived a king by the name of Bimbasara, who,
being fearful of some enemy arising that might overturn his kingdom,
frequently assembled his principal ministers together to hold discussion
with them on the subject. On one of these occasions they told him that
away to the north there was a respectable tribe of people called the
S&acirc;kyas, and that belonging to this race there was a youth newly-born,
the first-begotten of his mother, &amp;c. This youth, who was Buddha, they
said was liable to overturn him, they therefore advised him to "at once
raise an army and destroy the child."<a name="FNanchor_168:1_822" id="FNanchor_168:1_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_168:1_822" class="fnanchor">[168:1]</a></p>

<p>In the chronicles of the East Mongols, the same tale is to be found
repeated in the following story:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A certain king of a people called Patsala, had a son whose
peculiar appearance led the Brahmins at court to prophesy that
he would bring evil upon his father, and to advise his
destruction. Various modes of execution having failed, <i>the
boy was laid in a copper chest and thrown into the Ganges</i>.
Rescued by an old peasant who brought him up as his son, he,
in due time, learned the story of his escape, and returned to
seize upon the kingdom destined for him from his
birth."<a name="FNanchor_168:2_823" id="FNanchor_168:2_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_168:2_823" class="fnanchor">[168:2]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Hau-ki</i>, the Chinese hero of supernatural origin, was exposed in
infancy, as the "Shih-king" says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He was placed in a narrow lane, but the sheep and oxen
protected him with loving care. He was placed in a wide
forest, where he was met with by the wood-cutters. He was
placed on the cold ice, and a bird screened and supported him
with its wings," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_168:3_824" id="FNanchor_168:3_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_168:3_824" class="fnanchor">[168:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Mr. Legge draws a comparison with this to the Roman legend of Romulus.</p>

<p><i>Horus</i>, according to the Egyptian story, was born in the winter, and
brought up secretly in the Isle of Buto, for fear of Typhon, who sought
his life. Typhon at first schemed to prevent his birth and then sought
to destroy him when born.<a name="FNanchor_168:4_825" id="FNanchor_168:4_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_168:4_825" class="fnanchor">[168:4]</a></p>

<p>Within historical times, <i>Cyrus</i>, king of Persia (6th cent. <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>), is
the hero of a similar tale. His grandfather, Astyages, had dreamed
certain dreams which were interpreted by the Magi to mean that the
offspring of his daughter Mandane would expel him from his kingdom.</p>

<p>Alarmed at the prophecy, he handed the child to his kinsman Harpagos to
be slain; but this man having entrusted it to a shepherd to be exposed,
the latter contrived to save it by exhibiting to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>the emissaries of
Harpagos the body of a still-born child of which his own wife had just
been delivered. Grown to man's estate Cyrus of course justified the
prediction of the Magi by his successful revolt against Astyages and
assumption of the monarchy.</p>

<p>Herodotus, the Grecian Historian (<span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> 484), relates that Astyages, in
a vision, appeared to see a vine grow up from Mandane's womb, which
covered all Asia. Having seen this and communicated it to the
interpreters of dreams, he put her under guard, resolving to destroy
whatever should be born of her; for the Magian interpreters had
signified to him from his vision that the child born of Mandane would
reign in his stead. Astyages therefore, guarding against this, as soon
as Cyrus was born sought to have him destroyed. The story of his
exposure on the mountain, and his subsequent good fortune, is then
related.<a name="FNanchor_169:1_826" id="FNanchor_169:1_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_169:1_826" class="fnanchor">[169:1]</a></p>

<p><i>Abraham</i> was also a "dangerous child." At the time of his birth,
Nimrod, king of Babylon, was informed by his soothsayers that "a child
should be born in Babylonia, who would shortly become a great prince,
and that he had reason to fear him." The result of this was that Nimrod
then issued orders that "all women with child should be guarded with
great care, <i>and all children born of them should be put to
death</i>."<a name="FNanchor_169:2_827" id="FNanchor_169:2_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_169:2_827" class="fnanchor">[169:2]</a></p>

<p>The mother of Abraham was at that time with child, but, of course, <i>he</i>
escaped from being put to death, although many children were
slaughtered.</p>

<p><i>Zoroaster</i>, the chief of the religion of the Magi, was a "dangerous
child." Prodigies had announced his birth; he was exposed to dangers
from the time of his infancy, and was obliged to fly into Persia, like
Jesus into Egypt. Like him, he was pursued by a king, his enemy, who
wanted to get rid of him.<a name="FNanchor_169:3_828" id="FNanchor_169:3_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_169:3_828" class="fnanchor">[169:3]</a></p>

<p>His mother had alarming dreams of evil spirits seeking to destroy the
child to whom she was about to give birth. But a good spirit came to
comfort her and said: "Fear nothing! Ormuzd will protect this infant. He
has sent him as a prophet to the people. The world is waiting for
him."<a name="FNanchor_169:4_829" id="FNanchor_169:4_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_169:4_829" class="fnanchor">[169:4]</a></p>

<p><i>Perseus</i>, son of the Virgin Danae, was also a "dangerous child."
Acrisius, king of Argos, being told by the oracle that a son born of his
virgin daughter would destroy him, immured his daughter Danae in a
tower, <i>where no man could approach her</i>, and by this means hoped to
keep his daughter from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>becoming <i>enceinte</i>. The god Jupiter, however,
visited her there, as it is related of the Angel Gabriel visiting the
Virgin Mary,<a name="FNanchor_170:1_830" id="FNanchor_170:1_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_170:1_830" class="fnanchor">[170:1]</a> the result of which was that she bore a
son&mdash;<i>Perseus</i>. Acrisius, on hearing of his daughter's disgrace, caused
both her and the infant to be shut up in a chest and cast into the sea.
They were discovered by one Dictys, and liberated from what must have
been anything but a pleasant position.<a name="FNanchor_170:2_831" id="FNanchor_170:2_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_170:2_831" class="fnanchor">[170:2]</a></p>

<p><i>&AElig;sculapius</i>, when an infant, was exposed on the Mount of Myrtles, and
left there to die, but escaped the death which was intended for him,
having been found and cared for by <i>shepherds</i>.<a name="FNanchor_170:3_832" id="FNanchor_170:3_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_170:3_832" class="fnanchor">[170:3]</a></p>

<p><i>Hercules</i>, son of the virgin Leto, was left to die on a plain, but was
found and rescued by a maiden.<a name="FNanchor_170:4_833" id="FNanchor_170:4_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_170:4_833" class="fnanchor">[170:4]</a></p>

<p><i>&OElig;dipous</i> was a "dangerous child." Laios, King of Thebes, having been
told by the Delphic Oracle that &OElig;dipous would be his destroyer, no
sooner is &OElig;dipous born than the decree goes forth that the child must
be slain: but the servant to whom he is intrusted contents himself with
exposing the babe on the slopes of Mount Kithairon, where a <i>shepherd</i>
finds him, and carries him, like Cyrus or Romulus, to his wife, who
cherishes the child with a mother's care.<a name="FNanchor_170:5_834" id="FNanchor_170:5_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_170:5_834" class="fnanchor">[170:5]</a></p>

<p>The Theban myth of &OElig;dipous is repeated substantially in the Arcadian
tradition of <i>Telephos</i>. He is exposed, when a babe, on Mount Parthenon,
and is suckled by a doe, which represents the wolf in the myth of
Romulus, and the dog of the Persian story of Cyrus. Like Moses, he is
brought up in the palace of a king.<a name="FNanchor_170:6_835" id="FNanchor_170:6_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_170:6_835" class="fnanchor">[170:6]</a></p>

<p>As we read the story of Telephos, we can scarcely fail to think of the
story of the Trojan <i>Paris</i>, for, like Telephos, Paris is exposed as a
babe on the mountain-side.<a name="FNanchor_170:7_836" id="FNanchor_170:7_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_170:7_836" class="fnanchor">[170:7]</a> Before he is born, there are portents
of the ruin which he is to bring upon his house and people. Priam, the
ruling monarch, therefore decrees that the child shall be left to die on
the hill-side. But the babe lies on the slopes of <i>Ida</i> and is nourished
by a she-bear. He is fostered, like Crishna and others, by <i>shepherds</i>,
among whom he grows up.<a name="FNanchor_170:8_837" id="FNanchor_170:8_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_170:8_837" class="fnanchor">[170:8]</a></p>

<p><i>Iamos</i> was left to die among the bushes and violets. Aipytos, the
chieftain of Phaisana, had learned at Delphi that a child had been born
who should become the greatest of all the seers and prophets of the
earth, and he asked all his people where the babe <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>was: but none had
heard or seen him, for he lay away amid the thick bushes, with his soft
body bathed in the golden and pure rays of the violets. So when he was
found, they called him Iamos, the "violet child;" and as he grew in
years and strength, he went down into the Alpheian stream, and prayed to
his father that he would glorify his son. Then the voice of Zeus was
heard, bidding him come to the heights of Olympus, where he should
receive the gift of prophecy.<a name="FNanchor_171:1_838" id="FNanchor_171:1_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_171:1_838" class="fnanchor">[171:1]</a></p>

<p><i>Chandragupta</i> was also a "dangerous child." He is exposed to great
dangers in his infancy at the hands of a tributary chief who has
defeated and slain his suzerain. His mother, "relinquishing him to the
protection of the Devas, places him in a vase, and deposits him at the
door of a <i>cattle pen</i>." A <i>herdsman</i> takes the child and rears it as
his own.<a name="FNanchor_171:2_839" id="FNanchor_171:2_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_171:2_839" class="fnanchor">[171:2]</a></p>

<p><i>Jason</i> is another hero of the same kind. Pelias, the chief of Iolkos,
had been told that one of the children of Aiolos would be his destroyer,
and decreed, therefore, that all should be slain. Jason only is
preserved, and brought up by Cheiron.<a name="FNanchor_171:3_840" id="FNanchor_171:3_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_171:3_840" class="fnanchor">[171:3]</a></p>

<p><i>Bacchus</i>, son of the virgin Semele, was destined to bring ruin upon
Cadmus, King of Thebes, who therefore orders the infant to be put into a
chest and thrown into a river. He is found, and taken from the water by
loving hands, and lives to fulfill his mission.<a name="FNanchor_171:4_841" id="FNanchor_171:4_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_171:4_841" class="fnanchor">[171:4]</a></p>

<p>Herodotus relates a similar story, which is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The constitution of the <i>Corinthians</i> was formerly of this
kind; it was an <i>oligarchy</i>, (a government in the hands of a
selected few), and those who were called <i>Bacchiad&aelig;</i> governed
the city. About this time one Eetion, who had been married to
a maiden called Labda, and having no children by her, went to
Delphi to inquire of the oracle about having offspring. Upon
entering the temple he was immediately saluted as follows;
'Eetion, no one honors thee, though worthy of much honor.
Labda is pregnant and will bring forth a round stone; it will
fall on monarchs, and vindicate Corinth.' This oracle,
pronounced to Eetion, was by chance reported to the
<i>Bacchiad&aelig;</i>, who well knew that it prophesied the birth of a
son to Eetion who would overthrow them, and reign in their
stead; and though they comprehended, they kept it secret,
purposing to destroy the offspring that should be born to
Eetion. As soon as the woman brought forth, they sent ten
persons to the district where Eetion lived, to put the child
to death; but, the child, <i>by a divine providence</i>, was saved.
His mother hid him in a chest, and as they could not find the
child they resolved to depart, and tell those who sent them
that they had done all that they had commanded. After this,
Eetion's son grew up, and having escaped this danger, the name
of Cypselus was given him, from the chest. When Cypselus
reached man's estate, and consulted the oracle, an ambiguous
answer was given him at Delphi; relying on which he attacked
and got possession of Corinth."<a name="FNanchor_171:5_842" id="FNanchor_171:5_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_171:5_842" class="fnanchor">[171:5]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p><p><i>Romulus</i> and <i>Remus</i>, the founders of Rome, were exposed on the banks
of the Tiber, when infants, and left there to die, but escaped the death
intended for them.</p>

<p>The story of the "dangerous child" was well known in ancient Rome, and
several of their emperors, so it is said, were threatened with death at
their birth, or when mere infants. Julius Marathus, in his life of the
Emperor Augustus C&aelig;sar, says that before his birth there was a prophecy
in Rome that a king over the Roman people would soon be born. To obviate
this danger to the republic, the Senate ordered that all the male
children born in that year should be abandoned or exposed.<a name="FNanchor_172:1_843" id="FNanchor_172:1_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_172:1_843" class="fnanchor">[172:1]</a></p>

<p>The flight of the virgin-mother with her babe is also illustrated in the
story of Astrea when beset by Orion, and of Latona, the mother of
Apollo, when pursued by the monster.<a name="FNanchor_172:2_844" id="FNanchor_172:2_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_172:2_844" class="fnanchor">[172:2]</a> It is simply the same old
story, over and over again. Someone has predicted that a child born at a
certain time shall be great, he is therefore a "dangerous child," and
the reigning monarch, or some other interested party, attempts to have
the child destroyed, but he invariably escapes and grows to manhood, and
generally accomplishes the purpose for which he was intended. This
almost universal mythos was added to the fictitious history of Jesus by
its fictitious authors, who have made him escape in his infancy from the
reigning tyrant with the usual good fortune.</p>

<p>When a marvellous occurrence is said to have happened <i>everywhere</i>, we
may feel sure that it never happened anywhere. Popular fancies propagate
themselves indefinitely, but historical events, especially the striking
and dramatic ones, are rarely repeated. That this is a fictitious story
is seen from the narratives of the birth of Jesus, which are recorded by
the first and third Gospel writers, without any other evidence. In the
one&mdash;that related by the <i>Matthew</i> narrator&mdash;we have a birth at
Bethlehem&mdash;implying the ordinary residence of the parents there&mdash;and a
<i>hurried flight</i>&mdash;almost immediately after the birth&mdash;from that place
into Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_172:3_845" id="FNanchor_172:3_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_172:3_845" class="fnanchor">[172:3]</a> the slaughter of the infants, and a journey, after
many months, from Egypt to Nazareth in Galilee. In the other story&mdash;that
told by the <i>Luke</i> narrator&mdash;the parents, who have lived in Nazareth,
came to Bethlehem only for business of the State, and the casual birth
in the cave or stable is followed by a quiet sojourn, during which the
child is circumcised, and by a leisurely journey to Jerusalem; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>whence,
everything having gone off peaceably and happily, they return naturally
to their own former place of abode, full, <i>it is said over and over
again</i>, of wonder at the things that had happened, and deeply impressed
with the conviction that their child had a special work to do, and was
specially gifted for it. <i>There is no fear of Herod, who seems never to
trouble himself about the child, or even to have any knowledge of him.
There is no trouble or misery at Bethlehem, and certainly no mourning
for children slain.</i> Far from flying hurriedly away by night, his
parents <i>celebrate openly</i>, and at the usual time, the circumcision of
the child; and when he is presented in the temple, there is not only no
sign that enemies seek his life, <i>but the devout saints give public
thanks for the manifestation of the Saviour</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Hooykaas, speaking of the slaughter of the innocents, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Antiquity in general delighted in representing great men,
such as Romulus, Cyrus, and many more, as having been
threatened in their childhood by fearful dangers. This served
to bring into clear relief both the lofty significance of
their future lives, and the special protection of the deity
who watched over them.</p>

<p>"The brow of many a theologian has been bent over this
(Matthew) narrative! For, as long as people believed in the
miraculous inspiration of the Holy Scriptures, of course they
accepted every page as literally true, and thought that there
<i>could</i> not be any contradiction between the different
accounts or representations of Scripture. The worst of all
such pre-conceived ideas is, that they compel those who hold
them to do violence to their own sense of truth. For when
these so-called religious prejudices come into play, people
are afraid to call things by their right names, and, without
knowing it themselves, become guilty of all kinds of evasive
and arbitrary practices; for what would be thought quite
unjustifiable in any other case is here considered a duty,
inasmuch as it is supposed to tend toward the maintenance of
faith and the glory of God!"<a name="FNanchor_173:1_846" id="FNanchor_173:1_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_173:1_846" class="fnanchor">[173:1]</a></p></div>

<p>As we stated above, this story is to be found in the fictitious gospel
according to Matthew only; contemporary history has nowhere recorded
this audacious crime. It is mentioned neither by Jewish nor Roman
historians. Tacitus, who has stamped forever the crimes of despots with
the brand of reprobation, it would seem then, did not think such
infamies worthy of his condemnation. Josephus also, who gives us a
minute account of the atrocities perpetrated by Herod up to even the
very last moment of his life, does not say a single word about this
unheard-of crime, which must have been so notorious. Surely he must have
known of it, and must have mentioned it, had it ever been committed. "We
can readily imagine the Pagans," says Mr. Reber, "who composed the
learned and intelligent men of their day, at work in exposing the story
of Herod's cruelty, by showing that, considering the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>extent of
territory embraced in the order, and the population within it, the
assumed destruction of life stamped the story false and ridiculous. A
governor of a Roman province who dared make such an order would be so
speedily overtaken by the vengeance of the Roman people, that his head
would fall from his body before the blood of his victims had time to
dry. Archelaus, his son, was deposed for offenses not to be spoken of
when compared with this massacre of the infants."</p>

<p>No wonder that there is no trace at all in the Roman catacombs, nor in
Christian art, of this fictitious story, until about the beginning of
the fifth century.<a name="FNanchor_174:1_847" id="FNanchor_174:1_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_174:1_847" class="fnanchor">[174:1]</a> Never would Herod dared to have taken upon
himself the odium and responsibility of such a sacrifice. <i>Such a crime
could never have happened at the epoch of its professed perpetration.</i>
To such lengths were the early Fathers led, by the servile adaptation of
the ancient traditions of the East, they required a <i>second edition</i> of
the tyrant Kansa, and their holy wrath fell upon Herod. The Apostles of
Jesus counted too much upon human credulity, they trusted too much that
the future might not unravel their maneuvers, the sanctity of their
object made them too reckless. They destroyed all the evidence against
themselves which they could lay their hands upon, but they did not
destroy it all.</p>

<h3>THE TEMPTATION, AND FAST OF FORTY DAYS.</h3>

<p>We are informed by the <i>Matthew</i> narrator that, after being baptized by
John in the river Jordan, Jesus was led by the spirit into the
wilderness "<i>to be tempted of the devil</i>."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And when he had fasted <i>forty days and forty nights</i>, he was
afterward an hungered. And when the <i>tempter</i> came to him he
said: 'If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be
made bread.' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then the devil taketh him up into the holy
city, <i>and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple</i>, and saith
unto him: 'If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down.' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high
mountain, <i>and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world</i>, and
the glory of them, and saith unto him:' <i>All these things will
I give thee</i> if thou wilt fall down and worship me.' Then
saith Jesus unto him, 'Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only
shalt thou serve.' Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold,
angels came and ministered unto him."<a name="FNanchor_175:1_848" id="FNanchor_175:1_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_175:1_848" class="fnanchor">[175:1]</a></p></div>

<p>This is really a very peculiar story; it is therefore not to be wondered
at that many of the early Christian Fathers rejected it as being
fabulous,<a name="FNanchor_175:2_849" id="FNanchor_175:2_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_175:2_849" class="fnanchor">[175:2]</a> but this, according to orthodox teaching, cannot be
done; because, in all consistent reason, "<i>we must accept the whole of
the inspired autographs or reject the whole</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_175:3_850" id="FNanchor_175:3_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_175:3_850" class="fnanchor">[175:3]</a> and, because, "the
very foundations of our faith, the very basis of our hopes, the very
nearest and dearest of our consolations, are taken from us, when <i>one
line</i> of that sacred volume, on which we base everything, is declared to
be untruthful and untrustworthy."<a name="FNanchor_175:4_851" id="FNanchor_175:4_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_175:4_851" class="fnanchor">[175:4]</a></p>

<p>The reason why we have this story in the New Testament is because the
writer wished to show that Christ Jesus was proof against all
temptations, that <i>he</i> too, as well as <i>Buddha</i> and others, could resist
the powers of the prince of evil. This Angel-Messiah was tempted by the
devil, and he fasted for forty-seven days and nights, without taking an
atom of food.<a name="FNanchor_175:5_852" id="FNanchor_175:5_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_175:5_852" class="fnanchor">[175:5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p><p>The story of Buddha's temptation, presented below, is taken from the
"<i>Siamese Life of Buddha</i>," by Moncure D. Conway, and published in his
"<i>Sacred Anthology</i>," from which we take it.<a name="FNanchor_176:1_853" id="FNanchor_176:1_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_176:1_853" class="fnanchor">[176:1]</a> It is also to be
found in the <i>Fo-pen-hing</i>,<a name="FNanchor_176:2_854" id="FNanchor_176:2_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_176:2_854" class="fnanchor">[176:2]</a> and other works on Buddha and
Buddhism. Buddha went through a more lengthy and severe trial than did
Jesus, having been tempted in many different ways. The portion which
most resembles that recorded by the Matthew narrator is the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Grand Being (Buddha) applied himself to practice
<ins class="corr" title="original has ascetcism">asceticism</ins> of the extremest nature. <i>He ceased to eat</i> (that
is, <i>he fasted</i>) and held his breath.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Then it was that the
royal Mara</i> (the Prince of Evil) <i>sought occasion to tempt
him.</i> Pretending compassion, he said: 'Beware, O Grand Being,
your state is pitiable to look on; you are attenuated beyond
measure, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you are practicing this mortification in vain; I
can see that you will not live through it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lord, that art
capable of such vast endurance, go not forth to adopt a
religious life, but return to thy kingdom, and in <i>seven</i> days
thou shalt become <i>the Emperor of the World</i>, riding over the
four great continents.'"</p></div>

<p>To this the Grand Being, Buddha, replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'Take heed, O Mara; I also know that in seven days I might
gain universal empire, but I desire not such possessions. I
know that the pursuit of religion is better than the empire of
the world. You, thinking only of evil lusts, would force me to
leave all beings without guidance into your power. <i>Avaunt!
Get thou away from me!</i>'</p>

<p>"The Lord (then) rode onwards, intent on his purpose. The
skies rained flowers, and delicious odors pervaded the
air."<a name="FNanchor_176:3_855" id="FNanchor_176:3_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_176:3_855" class="fnanchor">[176:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Now, mark the similarity between these two legends.</p>

<p>Was Jesus about "beginning to preach" when he was tempted by the evil
spirit? So was Buddha about to go forth "to adopt a religious life,"
when he was tempted by the evil spirit.</p>

<p>Did Jesus fast, and was he "afterwards an hungered"? So did Buddha
"cease to eat," and was "attenuated beyond measure."</p>

<p>Did the evil spirit take Jesus and show him "all the kingdoms of the
world," which he promised to give him, provided he did not lead the life
he contemplated, but follow him?</p>

<p>So did the evil spirit say to Buddha: "Go not forth to adopt a religious
life, and in seven days thou shalt become an emperor of the world."</p>

<p>Did not Jesus resist these temptations, and say unto the evil one, "Get
thee behind me, Satan"?</p>

<p>So did Buddha resist the temptations, and said unto the evil one, "Get
thee away from me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p><p>After the evil spirit left Jesus did not "angels come and minister unto
him"?</p>

<p>So with Buddha. After the evil one had left him "the skies rained
flowers, and delicious odors pervaded the air."</p>

<p>These parallels are too striking to be accidental.</p>

<p><i>Zoroaster</i>, the founder of the religion of the Persians, was tempted by
the devil, who made him magnificent promises, in order to induce him to
become his servant and to be dependent on him, but the temptations were
in vain.<a name="FNanchor_177:1_856" id="FNanchor_177:1_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_177:1_856" class="fnanchor">[177:1]</a> "His temptation by the devil, forms the subject of many
traditional reports and legends."<a name="FNanchor_177:2_857" id="FNanchor_177:2_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_177:2_857" class="fnanchor">[177:2]</a></p>

<p><i>Quetzalcoatle</i>, the virgin-born Mexican Saviour, was also tempted by
the devil, and the forty days' fast was found among them.<a name="FNanchor_177:3_858" id="FNanchor_177:3_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_177:3_858" class="fnanchor">[177:3]</a></p>

<p>Fasting and self-denial were observances practiced by all nations of
antiquity. The <i>Hindoos</i> have days set apart for fasting on many
different occasions throughout the year, one of which is when the
birth-day of their Lord and Saviour Crishna is celebrated. On this
occasion, the day is spent in fasting and worship. They abstain entirely
from food and drink for more than thirty hours, at the end of which
Crishna's image is worshiped, and the story of his miraculous birth is
read to his hungry worshipers.<a name="FNanchor_177:4_859" id="FNanchor_177:4_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_177:4_859" class="fnanchor">[177:4]</a></p>

<p>Among the ancient <i>Egyptians</i>, there were times when the priests
submitted to abstinence of the most severe description, being forbidden
to eat even bread, and at other times they only ate it mingled with
hyssop. "The priests in Heliopolis," says Plutarch, "have many fasts,
during which they meditate on divine things."<a name="FNanchor_177:5_860" id="FNanchor_177:5_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_177:5_860" class="fnanchor">[177:5]</a></p>

<p>Among the <i>Sabians</i>, fasting was insisted on as an essential act of
religion. During the month <i>Tammuz</i>, they were in the habit of fasting
from sunrise to sunset, without allowing a morsel of food or drop of
liquid to pass their lips.<a name="FNanchor_177:6_861" id="FNanchor_177:6_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_177:6_861" class="fnanchor">[177:6]</a></p>

<p>The Jews also had their fasts, and on special occasions they gave
themselves up to prolonged fasts and mortifications.</p>

<p>Fasting and self-denial were observances required of the Greeks who
desired initiation into the <i>Mysteries</i>. Abstinence from food, chastity
and hard couches prepared the neophyte, who broke his fast on the third
and fourth day only, on consecrated food.<a name="FNanchor_177:7_862" id="FNanchor_177:7_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_177:7_862" class="fnanchor">[177:7]</a></p>

<p>The same practice was found among the ancient <i>Mexicans</i> and
<i>Peruvians</i>. Acosta, speaking of them, says:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"These priests and religious men used great fastings, of five
and ten days together, before any of their great feasts, and
they were unto them as our four ember weeks.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"They drank no wine, and slept little, for the greatest part
of their exercises (of penance) were at night, committing
great cruelties and martyring themselves for the devil, and
all to be reputed great fasters and penitents."<a name="FNanchor_178:1_863" id="FNanchor_178:1_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_178:1_863" class="fnanchor">[178:1]</a></p></div>

<p>In regard to the number of days which Jesus is said to have fasted being
specified as <i>forty</i>, this is simply owing to the fact that the number
<i>forty</i> as well as <i>seven</i> was a sacred one among most nations of
antiquity, particularly among the Jews, and because <i>others</i> had fasted
that number of days. For instance; it is related<a name="FNanchor_178:2_864" id="FNanchor_178:2_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_178:2_864" class="fnanchor">[178:2]</a> that <i>Moses</i>
went up into a mountain, "and he was there with the Lord <i>forty days and
forty nights, and he did neither eat bread, nor drink water</i>," which is
to say that he <i>fasted</i>.</p>

<p>In Deuteronomy<a name="FNanchor_178:3_865" id="FNanchor_178:3_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_178:3_865" class="fnanchor">[178:3]</a> Moses <i>is made to say</i>&mdash;for he did not write it,
"When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
then I abode in the mount <i>forty days and forty nights</i>, I neither did
eat bread nor drink water."</p>

<p><i>Elijah</i> also had a long fast, which, <i>of course</i>, was continued for a
period of <i>forty days and forty nights</i>.<a name="FNanchor_178:4_866" id="FNanchor_178:4_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_178:4_866" class="fnanchor">[178:4]</a></p>

<p><i>St. Joachim</i>, father of the "ever-blessed Virgin Mary," had a long
fast, which was also continued for a period of <i>forty days and forty
nights</i>. The story is to be found in the apocryphal gospel
<i>Protevangelion</i>.<a name="FNanchor_178:5_867" id="FNanchor_178:5_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_178:5_867" class="fnanchor">[178:5]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Persians</i> had a religious festival which they annually
celebrated, and which they called the "Salutation of Mithras." During
this festival, <i>forty days</i> were set apart for thanksgiving and
sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_178:6_868" id="FNanchor_178:6_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_178:6_868" class="fnanchor">[178:6]</a></p>

<p>The <i>forty days' fast</i> was found in the New World.</p>

<p>Godfrey Higgins tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The ancient <i>Mexicans</i> had a <i>forty days' fast</i>, in memory of
one of their sacred persons (Quetzalcoatle) who was tempted
(and fasted) <i>forty days</i> on a mountain."<a name="FNanchor_178:7_869" id="FNanchor_178:7_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_178:7_869" class="fnanchor">[178:7]</a></p></div>

<p>Lord Kingsborough says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The temptation of Quetzalcoatle, and <i>the fast of forty days,
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are very curious and mysterious</i>."<a name="FNanchor_178:8_870" id="FNanchor_178:8_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_178:8_870" class="fnanchor">[178:8]</a></p></div>

<p>The ancient Mexicans were also in the habit of making their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>prisoners
of war fast for a term of <i>forty days</i> before they were put to
death.<a name="FNanchor_179:1_871" id="FNanchor_179:1_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_179:1_871" class="fnanchor">[179:1]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Bonwick says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Spaniards were surprised to see the <i>Mexicans</i> keep the
vernal <i>forty days' fast</i>. The Tammuz month of Syria was in
the spring. The <i>forty days</i> were kept for Proserpine. Thus
does history repeat itself."<a name="FNanchor_179:2_872" id="FNanchor_179:2_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_179:2_872" class="fnanchor">[179:2]</a></p></div>

<p>The Spanish monks accounted for what Lord Kingsborough calls "very
curious and mysterious" circumstances, by the agency of the devil, and
burned all the books containing them, whenever it was in their power.</p>

<p>The forty days' fast was also found among some of the Indian tribes in
the New World. Dr. Daniel Brinton tells us that "the females of the
<i>Orinoco</i> tribes <i>fasted forty days</i> before marriage,"<a name="FNanchor_179:3_873" id="FNanchor_179:3_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_179:3_873" class="fnanchor">[179:3]</a> and Prof.
Max M&uuml;ller informs us that it was customary for some of the females of
the South American tribes of Indians "to fast before and after the birth
of a child," and that, among the <i>Carib-Coudave</i> tribe, in the West
Indies, "when a child is born the mother goes presently to work, but the
father begins to complain, and takes to his hammock, and there he is
visited as though he were sick. <i>He then fasts for forty days.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_179:4_874" id="FNanchor_179:4_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_179:4_874" class="fnanchor">[179:4]</a></p>

<p>The females belonging to the tribes of the Upper Mississippi, were held
unclean for <i>forty days</i> after childbirth.<a name="FNanchor_179:5_875" id="FNanchor_179:5_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_179:5_875" class="fnanchor">[179:5]</a> The prince of the
Tezcuca tribes <i>fasted forty days</i> when he wished an heir to his throne,
and the Mandanas supposed it required <i>forty days and forty nights</i> to
wash clean the earth at the deluge.<a name="FNanchor_179:6_876" id="FNanchor_179:6_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_179:6_876" class="fnanchor">[179:6]</a></p>

<p>The number <i>forty</i> is to be found in a great many instances in the Old
Testament; for instance, at the end of <i>forty days</i> Noah sent out a
raven from the ark.<a name="FNanchor_179:7_877" id="FNanchor_179:7_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_179:7_877" class="fnanchor">[179:7]</a> Isaac and Esau were each <i>forty years</i> old
when they married.<a name="FNanchor_179:8_878" id="FNanchor_179:8_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_179:8_878" class="fnanchor">[179:8]</a> <i>Forty days</i> were fulfilled for the embalming
of Jacob.<a name="FNanchor_179:9_879" id="FNanchor_179:9_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_179:9_879" class="fnanchor">[179:9]</a> The spies were <i>forty days</i> in search of the land of

<p>The number forty was used by the ancients in constructing temples. There
were <i>forty</i> pillars around the temple of Chilminar, in Persia; the
temple at Baalbec had <i>forty</i> pillars; on the frontiers of China, in
Tartary, there is to be seen the "Temple of the <i>forty</i> pillars."

<h3>THE CRUCIFIXION OF CHRIST JESUS.</h3>

<p>The punishment of an individual by crucifixion, for claiming to be "King
of the Jews," "Son of God," or "The Christ;" which are the causes
assigned by the Evangelists for the Crucifixion of Jesus, would need but
a passing glance in our inquiry, were it not for the fact that there is
much attached to it of a <i>dogmatic</i> and <i>heathenish</i> nature, which
demands considerably more than a "passing glance." The doctrine of
atonement for sin had been preached long before the doctrine was deduced
from the Christian Scriptures, long before these Scriptures are
pretended to have been written. Before the period assigned for the birth
of Christ Jesus, the poet <i>Ovid</i> had assailed the demoralizing delusion
with the most powerful shafts of philosophic scorn: "<i>When thou thyself
art guilty,</i>" says he, "<i>why should a victim die for thee? What folly it
is to expect <ins class="corr" title="original has savlation">salvation</ins> from the death of another.</i>"</p>

<p>The idea of expiation by the sacrifice of a <i>god</i> was to be found among
the Hindoos even in <i>Vedic</i> times. <i>The sacrificer was mystically
identified with the victim</i>, which was regarded as the ransom for sin,
and the instrument of its annulment. The <i>Rig-Veda</i> represents the gods
as sacrificing <i>Purusha</i>, the primeval male, supposed to be coeval with
the Creator. This idea is even more remarkably developed in the
<i>T&#257;ndya-br&#257;hmanas</i>, thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The lord of creatures (<i>praj&#257;-pati</i>) <i>offered himself a
sacrifice for the gods</i>."</p></div>

<p>And again, in the <i>Satapatha-br&#257;hmana</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He who, knowing this, sacrifices the <i>Purusha-medha</i>, or
sacrifice of the primeval male, becomes everything."<a name="FNanchor_181:1_892" id="FNanchor_181:1_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_181:1_892" class="fnanchor">[181:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Prof. Monier Williams, from whose work on <i>Hindooism</i> we quote the
above, says:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"Surely, in these mystical allusions to the sacrifice of a
representative man, we may perceive traces of the original
institution of sacrifice as a <i>divinely-appointed ordinance
typical of the one great sacrifice of the Son of God for the
sins of the world</i>."<a name="FNanchor_182:1_893" id="FNanchor_182:1_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_182:1_893" class="fnanchor">[182:1]</a></p></div>

<p>This idea of redemption from sin through the sufferings and death of a
Divine Incarnate Saviour, is simply the crowning-point of the idea
entertained by primitive man that the gods <i>demanded</i> a sacrifice of
some kind, to atone for some sin, or avert some calamity.</p>

<p>In primitive ages, when men lived mostly on vegetables, they offered
only grain, water, salt, fruit, and flowers to the gods, to propitiate
them and thereby obtain temporal blessings. But when they began to eat
meat and spices, and drink wine, they offered the same; naturally
supposing the deities would be pleased with whatever was useful or
agreeable to themselves. They imagined that some gods were partial to
animals, others to fruits, flowers, etc. To the celestial gods they
offered <i>white</i> victims at sunrise, or at open day. To the infernal
deities they sacrificed <i>black</i> animals in the night. Each god had some
creature peculiarly devoted to his worship. They sacrificed a <i>bull</i> to
Mars, a <i>dove</i> to Venus, and to Minerva, a <i>heifer</i> without blemish,
which had never been put to the yoke. If a man was too poor to sacrifice
a living animal, he offered an image of one made of bread.</p>

<p>In the course of time, it began to be imagined that the gods demanded
something more sacred as offerings or atonements for sin. This led to
the sacrifice of <i>human beings</i>, principally slaves and those taken in
war, then, their own children, even their most beloved "first-born." It
came to be an idea that every sin must have its prescribed amount of
punishment, <i>and that the gods would accept the life of one person as
atonement for the sins of others</i>. This idea prevailed even in Greece
and Rome: but there it mainly took the form of heroic self-sacrifice for
the public good. Cicero says: "The force of religion was so great among
our ancestors, that some of their commanders have, with their faces
veiled, and with the strongest expressions of sincerity, <i>sacrificed
themselves to the immortal gods to save their country</i>."<a name="FNanchor_182:2_894" id="FNanchor_182:2_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_182:2_894" class="fnanchor">[182:2]</a></p>

<p>In Egypt, offerings of human sacrifices, for the atonement of sin,
became so general that "if the eldest born of the family of Athamas
entered the temple of the <ins class="corr" title="original has Laphystan">Laphystian</ins> Jupiter at Alos in Achaia, he was
sacrificed, crowned with garlands like an animal victim."<a name="FNanchor_182:3_895" id="FNanchor_182:3_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_182:3_895" class="fnanchor">[182:3]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p><p>When the Egyptian priests offered up a sacrifice to the gods, they
pronounced the following imprecations on the head of the victim:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If any evil is about to befall either those who now
sacrifice, or Egypt in general, <i>may it be averted on this
head</i>."<a name="FNanchor_183:1_896" id="FNanchor_183:1_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_183:1_896" class="fnanchor">[183:1]</a></p></div>

<p>This idea of atonement finally resulted in the belief that the incarnate
<i>Christ</i>, the <i>Anointed</i>, the <i>God among us</i>, was to <i>save</i> mankind from
a curse by God imposed. Man had sinned, and God could not and did not
forgive without a propitiatory <i>sacrifice</i>. The curse of God must be
removed from the <i>sinful</i>, and the <i>sinless</i> must bear the load of that
curse. It was asserted that <i>divine justice</i> required <span class="allcapsc">BLOOD</span>.<a name="FNanchor_183:2_897" id="FNanchor_183:2_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_183:2_897" class="fnanchor">[183:2]</a></p>

<p>The belief of redemption from sin by the sufferings of a <i>Divine
Incarnation</i>, whether by death on the cross or otherwise, was general
and popular among the heathen, centuries before the time of Jesus of
Nazareth, and this dogma, no matter how sacred it may have become, or
how <i>consoling</i> it may be, must fall along with the rest of the material
of which the Christian church is built.</p>

<p>Julius Firmicius, referring to this popular belief among the <i>Pagans</i>,
says: "The <i>devil</i> has <i>his Christs</i>."<a name="FNanchor_183:3_898" id="FNanchor_183:3_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_183:3_898" class="fnanchor">[183:3]</a> This was the general
off-hand manner in which the Christian Fathers disposed of such matters.
Everything in the religion of the Pagans which corresponded to their
religion was of the devil. Most Protestant divines have resorted to the
<i>type</i> theory, of which we shall speak anon.</p>

<p>As we have done heretofore in our inquiries, we will first turn to
<i>India</i>, where we shall find, in the words of M. l'Abb&eacute; Huc, that "<i>the
idea of redemption by a divine incarnation</i>," who came into the world
for the express purpose of redeeming mankind, was "general and
popular."<a name="FNanchor_183:4_899" id="FNanchor_183:4_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_183:4_899" class="fnanchor">[183:4]</a></p>

<p>"A sense of <i>original corruption</i>," says Prof. Monier Williams, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>seems
to be felt by all classes of Hindoos, as indicated by the following
prayer used after the <i>G&#257;yatr&#299;</i> by some Vaishnavas:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'I am sinful, I commit sin, my nature is sinful, <i>I am
conceived in sin</i>. Save me, O thou lotus-eyed Heri (Saviour),
the remover of sin.'"<a name="FNanchor_184:1_900" id="FNanchor_184:1_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_184:1_900" class="fnanchor">[184:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Moreover, the doctrine of <i>bhakti</i> (<i>salvation by faith</i>) existed among
the Hindoos from the earliest times.<a name="FNanchor_184:2_901" id="FNanchor_184:2_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_184:2_901" class="fnanchor">[184:2]</a></p>

<p>Crishna, the virgin-born, "the Divine Vishnu himself,"<a name="FNanchor_184:3_902" id="FNanchor_184:3_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_184:3_902" class="fnanchor">[184:3]</a> "he who is
without beginning, middle or end,"<a name="FNanchor_184:4_903" id="FNanchor_184:4_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_184:4_903" class="fnanchor">[184:4]</a> being moved "to relieve the
earth of her load,"<a name="FNanchor_184:5_904" id="FNanchor_184:5_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_184:5_904" class="fnanchor">[184:5]</a> came upon earth and redeemed man by his
<i>sufferings</i>&mdash;to <i>save</i> him.</p>

<p>The accounts of the deaths of most all the virgin-born Saviours of whom
we shall speak, are conflicting. It is stated in one place that such an
one died in such a manner, and in another place we may find it stated
altogether differently. Even the accounts of the death of Jesus, as we
shall hereafter see, are conflicting; therefore, until the chapter on
"<i><a href="#CHAPTER_XXXIX">Explanation</a></i>" is read, these myths cannot really be thoroughly
understood.</p>

<p>As the Rev. Geo. W. Cox remarks, in his <i>Aryan Mythology</i>, Crishna is
described, in one of his aspects, as a self-sacrificing and unselfish
hero, a being who is filled with divine wisdom and love, who offers up a
sacrifice which he alone can make.<a name="FNanchor_184:6_905" id="FNanchor_184:6_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_184:6_905" class="fnanchor">[184:6]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Vishnu Purana</i><a name="FNanchor_184:7_906" id="FNanchor_184:7_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_184:7_906" class="fnanchor">[184:7]</a> speaks of <i>Crishna</i> being shot in the <i>foot</i>
with an arrow, and states that <i>this</i> was the cause of his death. Other
accounts, however, state that he was suspended on a tree, or in other
words, <i>crucified</i>.</p>

<p>Mons. Guigniaut, in his "<i>Religion de l'Antiquit&eacute;</i>" says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The death of Crishna is very differently related. One
remarkable and convincing tradition makes him perish on a
<i>tree</i>, to which he was <i>nailed</i> by the stroke of an
arrow."<a name="FNanchor_184:8_907" id="FNanchor_184:8_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_184:8_907" class="fnanchor">[184:8]</a></p></div>

<p>Rev. J. P. Lundy alludes to this passage of Guigniaut's in his
"Monumental Christianity," and translates the passage "un bois fatal"
(see note below) "<i>a cross</i>." Although we do not think he is justified
in doing this, as M. Guigniaut has distinctly stated that this "bois
fatal" (which is applied to a gibbet, a cross, a scaffold, etc.) was "un
arbre" (a <i>tree</i>), yet, he is justified in doing so on other accounts,
for we find that <i>Crishna</i> is represented <i>hanging on a cross</i>, and we
know that a <i>cross</i> was frequently called the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>"accursed <i>tree</i>." It was
an ancient custom to use trees as gibbets for crucifixion, or, if
artificial, to call the cross a tree.<a name="FNanchor_185:1_908" id="FNanchor_185:1_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_185:1_908" class="fnanchor">[185:1]</a></p>

<p>A writer in <i>Deuteronomy</i><a name="FNanchor_185:2_909" id="FNanchor_185:2_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_185:2_909" class="fnanchor">[185:2]</a> speaks of hanging criminals upon a
<i>tree</i>, as though it was a general custom, and says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He that is hanged (on a tree) is accursed of God."</p></div>

<p>And <i>Paul</i> undoubtedly refers to this text when he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Christ hath redeemed us from the <i>curse</i> of the law, being
made a curse for us; for it is written, 'Cursed is every one
that hangeth on a tree.'"<a name="FNanchor_185:3_910" id="FNanchor_185:3_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_185:3_910" class="fnanchor">[185:3]</a></p></div>

<p>It is evident, then, that to be hung on a cross was anciently called
hanging on a <i>tree</i>, and to be hung on a tree was called crucifixion. We
may therefore conclude from this, and from what we shall now see, that
Crishna was said to have been <i>crucified</i>.</p>

<p>In the earlier copies of Moor's "<i>Hindu Pantheon</i>," is to be seen
representations of Crishna (as <i>Wittoba</i>),<a name="FNanchor_185:4_911" id="FNanchor_185:4_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_185:4_911" class="fnanchor">[185:4]</a> with marks of holes in
both feet, and in others, of holes in the hands. In Figures 4 and 5 of
Plate 11 (Moor's work), the figures have <i>nail-holes in both feet</i>.
Figure 6 has a <i>round hole in the side</i>; to his collar or shirt hangs
the emblem of a <i>heart</i> (which we often see in pictures of Christ Jesus)
and on his head he has a <i>Yoni-Linga</i> (which we <i>do not</i> see in pictures
of Christ Jesus.)</p>

<p>Our Figure <a href="#Fig_7">No. 7</a> (next page), is a pre-Christian crucifix of <i>Asiatic</i>
origin,<a name="FNanchor_185:5_912" id="FNanchor_185:5_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_185:5_912" class="fnanchor">[185:5]</a> evidently intended to represent Crishna crucified. Figure
<a href="#Fig_8">No. 8</a> we can speak more positively of, it is surely Crishna crucified.
It is unlike any Christian crucifix ever made, and, with that described
above with the <i>Yoni-Linga</i> attached to the head, would probably not be
claimed as such. Instead of the <i>crown of thorns</i> usually put on the
head of the Christian Saviour, it has the turreted coronet of the
Ephesian Diana, the ankles are tied together by a cord, <i>and the dress
about the loins is exactly the style with which Crishna is almost always
represented</i>.<a name="FNanchor_185:6_913" id="FNanchor_185:6_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_185:6_913" class="fnanchor">[185:6]</a></p>

<p>And Dr. Inman says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Crishna, whose history so closely resembles our Lord's, was

(malefactors) were crucified with him, one of whom, through his favor,
went to heaven. One of the malefactors reviled him, but the other said
to Jesus: "Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom." And
Jesus said unto him: "Verily I say unto thee, to-day shalt thou be with
me in paradise." According to the <i>Vishnu Purana</i>, the hunter who shot
the arrow at Crishna afterwards said unto him: "Have pity upon me, who
am consumed by my crime, for thou art able to consume me!" Crishna
replied: "Fear not thou in the least. <i>Go, hunter, through my favor, to
heaven, the abode of the gods.</i>" As soon as he had thus spoken, a
celestial car appeared, and the hunter, ascending it, forthwith
proceeded to heaven. Then the illustrious Crishna, having united himself
with his own pure, spiritual, inexhaustible, inconceivable, unborn,
undecaying, imperishable and universal spirit, which is one with
<i>Vasudeva</i> (God),<a name="FNanchor_186:4_917" id="FNanchor_186:4_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_186:4_917" class="fnanchor">[186:4]</a> abandoned his mortal body, and the condition of

<p>The monk Georgius, in his <i>Tibetinum Alphabetum</i> (p. 203), has given
plates of <i>a crucified god</i> who was worshiped in <i>Nepal</i>. These
crucifixes were to be seen at the corners of roads and on eminences. He
calls it the god <i>Indra</i>. Figures <a href="#Fig_9">No. 9</a> and <a href="#Fig_10">No. 10</a> are taken from this
work. They are also different from any Christian crucifix yet produced.
Georgius says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If the matter stands as Beausobre thinks, then the
inhabitants of India, and the Buddhists, whose religion is the

Nepal, in the month of August, being about to celebrate the
festival days of the god <i>Indra</i>, erect crosses, wreathed with

<p>P. Andrada la Crozius, one of the first Europeans who went to Nepal and
Thibet, in speaking of the god whom they worshiped there&mdash;<i>Indra</i>&mdash;tells
us that they said <i>he spilt his blood for the salvation <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>of the human
race</i>, and that he was pierced through the body with nails. He further
says that, although they do not say he suffered the penalty of the
cross, yet they find, nevertheless, figures of it in their books.<a name="FNanchor_188:1_921" id="FNanchor_188:1_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_188:1_921" class="fnanchor">[188:1]</a></p>

<p>In regard to Beausobre's ideas that the religion of India is corrupted
Christianity, obtained from the Manicheans, little need be said, as all
scholars of the present day know that the religion of India is many
centuries older than Mani or the Manicheans.<a name="FNanchor_188:2_922" id="FNanchor_188:2_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_188:2_922" class="fnanchor">[188:2]</a></p>

<p>In the promontory of India, in the South, at Tanjore, and in the North,
at Oude or Ayoudia, was found the worship of the <i>crucified god Bal-li</i>.
This god, who was believed to have been an incarnation of Vishnu, was
represented with holes in his hands and side.<a name="FNanchor_188:3_923" id="FNanchor_188:3_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_188:3_923" class="fnanchor">[188:3]</a></p>

<p>The incarnate god Buddha, although said to have expired peacefully at
the foot of a tree, is nevertheless described as a suffering Saviour,
who, "when his mind was moved by pity (for the human race) <i>gave his
life like grass for the sake of others</i>."<a name="FNanchor_188:4_924" id="FNanchor_188:4_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_188:4_924" class="fnanchor">[188:4]</a></p>

offenses of mankind, and thereby to make them partakers of the kingdom
of heaven. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>This induces him to say "Can a Christian doubt that this

<p>As a spirit in the fourth heaven, he resolves to give up "all that
glory, in order to be born into the world," "to rescue all men from
their misery and every future consequence of it." He vows "to deliver
all men, who are left as it were without a <i>Saviour</i>."<a name="FNanchor_189:2_935" id="FNanchor_189:2_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_189:2_935" class="fnanchor">[189:2]</a></p>

<p>While in the realms of the blest, and when about to descend upon earth
to be born as man, he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am now about to assume a body; not for the sake of gaining
wealth, or enjoying the pleasures of sense, but I am about to

<p>M. l'Abb&eacute; Huc says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the eyes of the Buddhists, this personage (Buddha) is
sometimes a man and sometimes a god, or rather both one and
the other&mdash;a divine incarnation, a man-god&mdash;who came into the
world to enlighten men, to <i>redeem them</i>, and to indicate to
them the way of safety. This idea of <i>redemption by a divine
incarnation</i> is so general and popular among the Buddhists,
that during our travels in Upper Asia we everywhere found it
expressed in a neat formula. If we addressed to a Mongol or a
Thibetan the question 'Who is Buddha?' he would immediately
reply: '<i>The Saviour of Men!</i>'"<a name="FNanchor_189:4_937" id="FNanchor_189:4_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_189:4_937" class="fnanchor">[189:4]</a></p></div>

<p>According to Prof. Max M&uuml;ller, Buddha is reported as saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Let all the sins that were committed in this world fall on
me, that the world may be delivered.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_189:5_938" id="FNanchor_189:5_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_189:5_938" class="fnanchor">[189:5]</a></p></div>

<p>The <i>Indians</i> are no strangers to the doctrine of <i>original sin</i>. It is
their invariable belief that <i>man is a fallen being</i>; admitted by them
from time immemorial.<a name="FNanchor_189:6_939" id="FNanchor_189:6_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_189:6_939" class="fnanchor">[189:6]</a> And what we have seen concerning their
beliefs in <i>Crishna</i> and <i>Buddha</i> unmistakably shows a belief in a
<i>divine Saviour</i>, who <i>redeems man</i>, and takes upon himself the sins of
the world; so that "<i>Baddha</i> paid it all, all to him is due."<a name="FNanchor_189:7_940" id="FNanchor_189:7_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_189:7_940" class="fnanchor">[189:7]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p><p>The idea of redemption through the sufferings and death of a <i>Divine
Saviour</i>, is to be found even in the ancient religions of China. One of
their five sacred volumes, called the <i>Y-King</i>, says, in speaking of
<i>Tien, the "Holy One"</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>Holy One</i> will unite in himself all the virtues of
heaven and earth. By his justice the world will be
re-established in the ways of righteousness. He will labor and
suffer much. He must pass the great torrent, whose waves shall

<p>An ancient commentator says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The common people sacrifice their lives to gain bread; the
philosophers to gain reputation; the nobility to perpetuate
their families. The <i>Holy One</i> (<i>Tien</i>) does not seek himself,

<p><i>Tien</i>, the Holy One, is always spoken of as one with God, existing with
him from all eternity, "before anything was made."</p>

<p><i>Osiris</i> and <i>Horus</i>, the Egyptian virgin-born gods, suffered
death.<a name="FNanchor_190:3_943" id="FNanchor_190:3_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_190:3_943" class="fnanchor">[190:3]</a> Mr. Bonwick, speaking of <i>Osiris</i>, says:</p>

<p>Sir J. G. Wilkinson says of him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The sufferings and death of <i>Osiris</i> were the great Mystery
of the Egyptian religion, and some traces of it are
perceptible among other peoples of antiquity. His being the
<i>Divine Goodness</i>, and the abstract idea of 'good,' his
manifestation upon earth (like a Hindoo god), his death and
resurrection, and his office as judge of the dead in a future
state, <i>look like the early revelation of a future

<p><i>Horus</i> was also called "The Saviour." "As Horus Sneb, he is the

<p><i>Attys</i>, who was called the "<i>Only Begotten Son</i>"<a name="FNanchor_190:9_949" id="FNanchor_190:9_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_190:9_949" class="fnanchor">[190:9]</a> and
"<i>Saviour</i>," was worshiped by the Phrygians (who were regarded as one of
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>oldest races of Asia Minor). He was represented by them as <i>a man
tied to a tree</i>, at the foot of which was a <i>lamb</i>,<a name="FNanchor_191:1_950" id="FNanchor_191:1_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_191:1_950" class="fnanchor">[191:1]</a> and, without
doubt, also <i>as a man nailed to the tree, or stake</i>, for we find
Lactantius making this Apollo of Miletus (anciently, the greatest and
most flourishing city of Ionia, in Asia Minor) say that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He was a mortal according to the flesh; wise in miraculous
works; but, being arrested by an armed force by command of the
Chaldean judges, <i>he suffered a death made bitter with nails

<p>In this god of the Phrygians, we again have the myth of the <i>crucified
Saviour of Paganism</i>.</p>

<p>By referring to Mrs. Jameson's "History of Our Lord in Art,"<a name="FNanchor_191:3_952" id="FNanchor_191:3_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_191:3_952" class="fnanchor">[191:3]</a> or
to illustrations in <a href="#CHAPTER_XL">chapter xl.</a> this work, it will be seen that a common
mode of representing a crucifixion was that of a man, tied with cords by
the hands and feet, to an upright beam or stake. The <i>lamb</i>, spoken of
above, which signifies considerable, we shall speak of in its proper
place.</p>

<p><i>Tammuz</i>, or <i>Adonis</i>, the Syrian and Jewish <i>Adonai</i> (in Hebrew "Our
Lord"), was another <i>virgin-born</i> god, who suffered for mankind, and who
had the title of <i>Saviour</i>. The accounts of his death are conflicting,
just as it is with almost all of the so-called Saviours of mankind
(<i>including the Christian Saviour</i>, as we shall hereafter see) one
account, however, makes him a <i>crucified Saviour</i>.<a name="FNanchor_191:4_953" id="FNanchor_191:4_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_191:4_953" class="fnanchor">[191:4]</a></p>

<p>It is certain, however, that the ancients who honored him as their Lord
and Saviour, celebrated, annually, a feast in commemoration of his
death. An image, intended as a representation of their Lord, was laid on
a bed or bier, and bewailed in mournful ditties&mdash;just as the Roman
Catholics do at the present day in their "Good Friday" mass.</p>

<p>During this ceremony the priest murmured:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Trust ye in your Lord, for the pains which he endured, our
salvation have procured.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_191:5_954" id="FNanchor_191:5_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_191:5_954" class="fnanchor">[191:5]</a></p></div>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Parkhurst, in his "Hebrew Lexicon," after referring to what
we have just stated above, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I find myself <i>obliged</i> to refer <i>Tammuz</i> to that class of
idols which were originally designed to represent the promised
Saviour, the Desire of all Nations. His other name, <i>Adonis</i>,
is almost the very Hebrew <i>Adoni</i> or <i>Lord</i>, a well-known
title of Christ."<a name="FNanchor_191:6_955" id="FNanchor_191:6_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_191:6_955" class="fnanchor">[191:6]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p><p><i>Prometheus</i> was a crucified Saviour. He was "an immortal god, a friend

<p>The tragedy of the crucifixion of Prometheus, written by &AElig;schylus, was
acted in Athens five hundred years before the Christian Era, and is by
many considered to be the most ancient dramatic poem now in existence.
The plot was derived from materials even at that time of an infinitely
remote antiquity. Nothing was ever so exquisitely calculated to work
upon the feelings of the spectators. No author ever displayed greater
powers of poetry, with equal strength of judgment, in supporting through
the piece the august character of the <i>Divine Sufferer</i>. The spectators
themselves were unconsciously made a party to the interest of the scene:
its hero was their friend, their benefactor, their creator, and their
<i>Saviour</i>; his wrongs were incurred in their quarrel&mdash;<i>his sorrows were
endured for their salvation</i>; "he was wounded for their transgressions,
and bruised for their iniquities; the chastisement of their peace was
upon him, and by his stripes they were healed;" "he was oppressed and
afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth." The majesty of his silence,
whilst the ministers of an offended god were <i>nailing him by the hands
and feet to Mount Caucasus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_192:2_957" id="FNanchor_192:2_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_192:2_957" class="fnanchor">[192:2]</a> could be only equaled by the modesty
with which he relates, <i>while hanging with arms extended in the form of
a cross</i>, his services to the human race, which had brought on him that
horrible crucifixion.<a name="FNanchor_192:3_958" id="FNanchor_192:3_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_192:3_958" class="fnanchor">[192:3]</a> "None, save myself," says he, "opposed his

Evil having spread itself over the earth, through the inquisitiveness of

universe shall worship him, and shall praise in songs his blessings." In

<p>The Persians believed that they were tainted with <i>original sin</i>, owing

<p>They considered their law-giver <i>Zoroaster</i> to be also a <i>Divine
Messenger</i>, sent to redeem men from their evil ways, and they always
worshiped his memory. To this day his followers mention him with the
greatest reverence, calling him "<i>The Immortal Zoroaster</i>," <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>"<i>The

<p>"In the life of Zoroaster the common mythos is apparent. He was born in
innocence, of an immaculate conception, of a ray of the Divine Reason.
As soon as he was born, the glory arising from his body enlightened the
room, and he laughed at his mother. He was called a <i>Splendid Light from
the Tree of Knowledge</i>, and, in fine, he or his soul was <i>suspensus a
lingo</i>, hung upon a tree, and this was the Tree of Knowledge."<a name="FNanchor_195:2_988" id="FNanchor_195:2_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_195:2_988" class="fnanchor">[195:2]</a></p>

<p>He also tells us that there is a very remarkable figure copied in Payne

<p>It is said that Peter called his Master <i>the Christ</i>, whereupon "he

<p>The title of "<i>Christ</i>" or "The Anointed," was held by the kings of
Israel. "Touch not my Christ and do my prophets no harm," says the
Psalmist.<a name="FNanchor_196:8_1004" id="FNanchor_196:8_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_196:8_1004" class="fnanchor">[196:8]</a></p>

<p>The term "Christ" was applied to religious teachers, leaders of
factions, necromancers or wonder-workers, &amp;c. This is seen by the
passage in <i>Matthew</i>, where the writer says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall
show great signs and wonders, insomuch that, if it were
possible, they shall deceive the very elect."<a name="FNanchor_196:9_1005" id="FNanchor_196:9_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_196:9_1005" class="fnanchor">[196:9]</a></p></div>

<p>The virgin-born Crishna and Buddha were incarnations of Vishnu, called
Avatars. An Avatar is an <i>Angel-Messiah</i>, a <i>God-man</i>, a <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; for the
word <i>Christ</i> is from the Greek <i>Christos</i>, an <i>Anointed One</i>, a
<i>Messiah</i>.</p>

<p>The name <i>Jesus</i>, which is pronounced in Hebrew <i>Yezua</i>, and is
sometimes Grecized into <i>Jason</i>, was very common. After the Captivity it
occurs quite frequently, and is interchanged with the name <i>Joshua</i>.
Indeed Joshua, the successor of Moses, is called Jesus in the New
Testament more than once,<a name="FNanchor_196:10_1006" id="FNanchor_196:10_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_196:10_1006" class="fnanchor">[196:10]</a> though the meaning of the two names is
not really quite the same. We know of a Jesus, son of Sirach, a writer
of proverbs, whose collection is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>preserved among the apocryphal books
of the Old Testament. The notorious <i>Barabbas</i><a name="FNanchor_197:1_1007" id="FNanchor_197:1_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_197:1_1007" class="fnanchor">[197:1]</a> or <i>son of Abbas</i>,
was himself called Jesus. Among Paul's opponents we find a magician
called Elymas, <i>the Son of Jesus</i>. Among the early Christians a certain
Jesus, also called Justus, appears. Flavius Josephus mentions more than
<i>ten</i> distinct persons&mdash;priests, robbers, peasants, and others&mdash;who bore
the name of Jesus, all of whom lived during the last century of the
Jewish state.<a name="FNanchor_197:2_1008" id="FNanchor_197:2_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_197:2_1008" class="fnanchor">[197:2]</a></p>

<p>To return now to our theme&mdash;<i>crucified gods before the time of Jesus of
Nazareth</i>.</p>

<p>The holy Father <i>Minucius Felix</i>, in his <i>Octavius</i>, written as late as
<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 211, indignantly <i>resents the supposition that the sign of the
cross should be considered exclusively as a Christian symbol</i>, and
represents his advocate of the Christian argument as retorting on an
infidel opponent. His words are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<a name="Minucius_Felix_quote" id="Minucius_Felix_quote"></a>"As for the adoration of <i>crosses</i> which you (<i>Pagans</i>) object
against us (<i>Christians</i>), I must tell you, <i>that we neither
adore crosses nor desire them; you it is, ye Pagans</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who
are the most likely people to adore wooden crosses .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for
what else are your ensigns, flags, and standards, <i>but crosses
gilt and beautiful</i>. Your victorious trophies not only
represent a simple cross, <i>but a cross with a man upon
it</i>."<a name="FNanchor_197:3_1009" id="FNanchor_197:3_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_197:3_1009" class="fnanchor">[197:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The existence, in the writings of Minucius Felix, of this passage, is
probably owing to an oversight of the destroyers of all evidences
against the Christian religion that could be had. The practice of the
Romans, here alluded to, of carrying <i>a cross with a man on it</i>, or, in
other words, a <i>crucifix</i>, has evidently been concealed from us by the
careful destruction of such of their works as alluded to it. The priests
had everything their own way for centuries, and to destroy what was
evidence against their claims was a very simple matter.</p>

<p>It is very evident that this celebrated Christian Father alludes to some
Gentile mystery, of which the prudence of his successors has deprived
us. When we compare this with the fact that for centuries after the time
assigned for the birth of Christ Jesus, he was not represented as a man
on a cross, and that the Christians did not have such a thing as a
<i>crucifix</i>, we are inclined to think that the effigies of a black or
<i>dark-skinned crucified man</i>, which were to be seen in many places in
Italy even during the last century, may have had something to do with
it.<a name="FNanchor_197:4_1010" id="FNanchor_197:4_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_197:4_1010" class="fnanchor">[197:4]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p><p>While speaking of "<i>a cross with a man on it</i>" as being carried by the
Pagan Romans as a <i>standard</i>, we might mention the fact, related by
Arrian the historian,<a name="FNanchor_198:1_1011" id="FNanchor_198:1_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_198:1_1011" class="fnanchor">[198:1]</a> that the troops of Porus, in their war with
Alexander the Great, carried on their standards <i>the figure of a
man</i>.<a name="FNanchor_198:2_1012" id="FNanchor_198:2_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_198:2_1012" class="fnanchor">[198:2]</a> Here is evidently the <i>crucifix standard</i> again.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This must have been (says Mr. Higgins) a Staurobates or
Salivahana, and looks very like the figure of a man carried on
their standards by the Romans. This was similar to the dove
carried on the standards of the Assyrians. This must have been
the crucifix of Nepaul."<a name="FNanchor_198:3_1013" id="FNanchor_198:3_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_198:3_1013" class="fnanchor">[198:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Tertullian, a Christian Father of the second and third centuries,
writing to the Pagans, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The origin of <i>your</i> gods is derived from <i>figures moulded on
a cross</i>. All those rows of <i>images on your standards</i> are the
appendages of crosses; those hangings on your standards and
banners are the robes of crosses."<a name="FNanchor_198:4_1014" id="FNanchor_198:4_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_198:4_1014" class="fnanchor">[198:4]</a></p></div>

<p>We have it then, on the authority of a Christian Father, as late as <span class="allcapsc">A.
D.</span> 211, that the Christians "<i>neither adored crosses nor desired them</i>,"
but that the <i>Pagans</i> "adored crosses," and not that alone, but "<i>a
cross with a man upon it</i>." This we shall presently find to be the case.
Jesus, in those days, nor for centuries after, was <i>not</i> represented as
a <i>man on a cross</i>. He was represented as a <i>lamb</i>, and the adoration of
the crucifix, by the Christians, was a later addition to their religion.
But this we shall treat of in its place.</p>

<p>We may now ask the question, who was this <i>crucified man</i> whom the
Pagans "<i>adored</i>" before and after the time of Jesus of Nazareth? Who
did the crucifix represent? It was, undoubtedly, "the Saviour crucified
for the salvation of mankind," long before the Christian Era, <i>whose
effigies were to be seen in many places all over Italy</i>. These Pagan
crucifixes were either destroyed, corrupted, or adopted; the latter was
the case with many ancient paintings of the <i>Bambino</i>,<a name="FNanchor_198:5_1015" id="FNanchor_198:5_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_198:5_1015" class="fnanchor">[198:5]</a> on which
may be seen the words <i>Deo Soli</i>. Now, these two words can never apply
to Christ Jesus. He was <i>not Deus Solus</i>, in any sense, according to the
idiom of the Latin language, and the Romish faith. Whether we construe
the words to "the only God," or "God alone," they are equally heretical.
No priest, in any age of the Church, would have thought of putting them
there, <i>but finding them there</i>, they tolerated them.</p>

<p>In the "<i>Celtic Druids</i>," Mr. Higgins describes a <i>crucifix</i>, a <i>lamb</i>,
and an <i>elephant</i>, which was cut upon the "fire tower"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>&mdash;so-called&mdash;at
Brechin, a town of Forfarshire, in Scotland. Although they appeared to
be of very ancient date, he supposed, at that time, that they were
modern, and belonged to Christianity, but some years afterwards, he
wrote as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I now doubt (the modern date of the tower), for we have, over
and over again, seen the crucified man before Christ. We have
also found 'The Lamb that taketh away the sins of the world,'

very stubborn fellow to be found here. The Ring, too, when
joined with other matters, I cannot get over. <i>All these
superstitions must have come from India.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_199:6_1021" id="FNanchor_199:6_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_199:6_1021" class="fnanchor">[199:6]</a></p></div>

<p>On one of the Irish "round towers" is to be seen <i>a crucifix of
unmistakable Asiatic origin</i>.<a name="FNanchor_199:7_1022" id="FNanchor_199:7_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_199:7_1022" class="fnanchor">[199:7]</a></p>

<p>If we turn to the New World, we shall find strange though it may appear,
that the ancient <i>Mexicans</i> and <i>Peruvians</i> worshiped a <i>crucified
Saviour</i>. This was the virgin-born <i>Quetzalcoatle</i> whose crucifixion is
represented in the paintings of the "<i>Codex Borgianus</i>," and the "<i>Codex
Vaticanus</i>."</p>

<p>These paintings illustrate the religious opinions of the ancient
Mexicans, and were copied from the hieroglyphics found in Mexico. The
Spaniards destroyed nearly all the books, ancient monuments and
paintings which they could find; had it not been for this, much more
regarding the religion of the ancient Mexicans would have been handed
down to us. Many chapters were also taken&mdash;by the Spanish
authorities&mdash;from the writings of the first historians who wrote on
ancient Mexico. <i>All manuscripts had to be inspected previous to being
published.</i> Anything found among these heathens resembling the religion
of the Christians, was destroyed when possible.<a name="FNanchor_199:8_1023" id="FNanchor_199:8_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_199:8_1023" class="fnanchor">[199:8]</a></p>

<p>The first Spanish monks who went to Mexico were surprised to find the
<i>crucifix</i> among the heathen inhabitants, and upon inquiring what it
meant, were told that it was a representation of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span><i>Bacob</i>
(Quetzalcoatle), the Son of God, who was put to death by <i>Eopuco</i>. They
said that he was placed on a beam of wood, <i>with his arms stretched
out</i>, and that he died there.<a name="FNanchor_200:1_1024" id="FNanchor_200:1_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_200:1_1024" class="fnanchor">[200:1]</a></p>

<p>Lord Kingsborough, from whose very learned and elaborate work we have
taken the above, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Being questioned as to the manner in which they became
acquainted with these things, they replied that the lords
instructed their sons in them, and that thus this doctrine
descended from one to another."<a name="FNanchor_200:2_1025" id="FNanchor_200:2_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_200:2_1025" class="fnanchor">[200:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Sometimes Quetzalcoatle or Bacob is represented as <i>tied</i> to the
cross&mdash;just as we have seen that <i>Attys</i> was represented by the
Phrygians&mdash;and at other times he is represented "in the attitude of a
person crucified, with impressions of nail-holes in his hands and feet,
but not actually upon a cross"&mdash;just as we have found the Hindoo
<i>Crishna</i>, and as he is represented in <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. No. 8</a>. Beneath <i>this</i>
representation of Quetzalcoatle crucified, is an image of Death, which
an angry serpent seems threatening to devour.<a name="FNanchor_200:3_1026" id="FNanchor_200:3_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_200:3_1026" class="fnanchor">[200:3]</a></p>

<p>On the 73d page of the Borgian MS., he is represented <i>crucified on a
cross of the Greek form</i>. In this print there are also <i>impressions of
nails</i> to be seen on the <i>feet and hands</i>, and his body is strangely
covered with <i>suns</i>.<a name="FNanchor_200:4_1027" id="FNanchor_200:4_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_200:4_1027" class="fnanchor">[200:4]</a></p>

<p>In vol. ii. plate 75, the god is crucified in a circle of nineteen
figures, and a <i>serpent</i> is depriving him of the organs of generation.</p>

<p>Lord Kingsborough, commenting on these paintings, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is remarkable that in these Mexican paintings the faces of
many of the figures are <i>black</i>, and that the visage of
Quetzalcoatle is frequently painted in a very deformed
manner."<a name="FNanchor_200:5_1028" id="FNanchor_200:5_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_200:5_1028" class="fnanchor">[200:5]</a></p></div>

<p>His lordship further tells us that (according to the belief of the
ancient Mexicans), "the death of Quetzalcoatle upon the cross" was "<i>an
atonement for the sins of mankind</i>."<a name="FNanchor_200:6_1029" id="FNanchor_200:6_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_200:6_1029" class="fnanchor">[200:6]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Daniel Brinton, in his "<i>Myths of the New World</i>," tells us that the
<i>Aztecs</i> had a feast which they celebrated "<i>in the early spring</i>," when
"<i>victims were nailed to a cross and shot with an arrow</i>."<a name="FNanchor_200:7_1030" id="FNanchor_200:7_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_200:7_1030" class="fnanchor">[200:7]</a></p>

<p>Alexander Von Humboldt, in his "<i>American Researches</i>," also speaks of
this feast, when the Mexicans crucified a man, and pierced him with an
arrow.<a name="FNanchor_200:8_1031" id="FNanchor_200:8_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_200:8_1031" class="fnanchor">[200:8]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p><p>The author of <i>Monumental Christianity</i>, speaking of this, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Here is the old story of the <i>Prometheus crucified</i> on the
Caucasus, <i>and of all other Pagan crucifixions of the young
incarnate divinities of India, Persia, Asia Minor and
Egypt</i>."<a name="FNanchor_201:1_1032" id="FNanchor_201:1_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_201:1_1032" class="fnanchor">[201:1]</a></p></div>

<p>This we believe; <i>but how did this myth get there</i>? He does not say, but
we shall attempt to show, in a future chapter, how <i>this</i> and <i>other</i>
myths of Eastern origin became known in the New World.<a name="FNanchor_201:2_1033" id="FNanchor_201:2_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_201:2_1033" class="fnanchor">[201:2]</a></p>

<p>It must not be forgotten, in connection with what we have seen
concerning the Mexican crucified god being sometimes represented as
<i>black</i>, and the feast when the <i>crucified man</i> was shot with an arrow,
that effigies of a <i>black crucified man were found in Italy</i>; that
Crishna, the crucified, is very often represented <i>black</i>; and that
<i>Crishna</i> was shot with an arrow.</p>

<p>Crosses were also found in <i>Yucatan</i>, as well as Mexico, <i>with a man
upon them</i>.<a name="FNanchor_201:3_1034" id="FNanchor_201:3_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_201:3_1034" class="fnanchor">[201:3]</a> Cogolludo, in his "History of Yucatan," speaking of a
crucifix found there, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Don Eugenio de Alcantara (one of the true teachers of the
Gospel), told me, not only once, that I might safely write
that the Indians of Cozumel possessed this holy cross in the
time of their paganism; and that some years had elapsed since
it was brought to Medira; for having heard from many persons
what was reported of it, he had made particular inquiries of
some very old Indians who resided there, who assured him that
it was the fact."</p></div>

<p>He then speaks of the difficulty in accounting for this crucifix being
found among the Indians of Cozumel, and ends by saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"But if it be considered that these Indians believed that the
Son of God, whom they called Bacob, <i>had died upon a cross,
with his arms stretched out upon it</i>, it cannot appear so
difficult a matter to comprehend that they should have formed
his image according to the religious creed which they
possessed."<a name="FNanchor_201:4_1035" id="FNanchor_201:4_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_201:4_1035" class="fnanchor">[201:4]</a></p></div>

<p>We shall find, in another chapter, that these virgin-born "<i>Saviours</i>"
and "Slain Ones;" Crishna, Osiris, Horus, Attys, Adonis, Bacchus,
&amp;c.&mdash;whether torn in pieces, killed by a boar, or crucified&mdash;<i>will all
melt into</i> <span class="allcapsc">ONE</span>.</p>

<p>We now come to a very important fact not generally known, namely: <i>There
are no early representations of Christ Jesus suffering on the cross.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Rev. J. P. Lundy, speaking of this, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Why should a fact so well known to the heathen as the
crucifixion be concealed? <i>And yet its actual realistic
representation never once occurs in the monuments of
Christianity, for more than six or seven centuries.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_202:1_1036" id="FNanchor_202:1_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_202:1_1036" class="fnanchor">[202:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Mrs. Jameson, in her "History of Our Lord in Art," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The crucifixion is <i>not</i> one of the subjects of early
Christianity. The death of our Lord was represented by various
<i>types</i>, but <i>never in its actual form</i>.</p>

<p>"The <i>earliest</i> instances of the <i>crucifixion</i> are found in
illustrated manuscripts of various countries, and in those
<i>ivory and enameled forms</i> which are described in the
Introduction. Some of these are ascertained, by historical or
by internal evidence, to have been executed in the <i>ninth
century</i>, there is one also, of an extraordinary rude and
fantastic character, in a MS. in the ancient library of St.
Galle, which is ascertained to be of the <i>eighth century</i>. <i>At
all events, there seems no just grounds at present for
assigning an earlier date.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_202:2_1037" id="FNanchor_202:2_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_202:2_1037" class="fnanchor">[202:2]</a></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Early Christian art, such as it appears in the bas-reliefs on
sarcophagi, gave but one solitary incident from the story of
Our Lord's Passion, <i>and that utterly divested of all
circumstances of suffering</i>. Our Lord is represented as young
and beautiful, free from bonds, with no '<i>accursed tree</i>' on
his shoulders."<a name="FNanchor_202:3_1038" id="FNanchor_202:3_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_202:3_1038" class="fnanchor">[202:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The oldest representation of Christ Jesus was a figure of a
<i>lamb</i>,<a name="FNanchor_202:4_1039" id="FNanchor_202:4_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_202:4_1039" class="fnanchor">[202:4]</a> to which sometimes a vase was added, into which his blood
flowed, and at other times couched at the foot of a cross. <i>This custom
subsisted up to the year 680, and until the pontificate of Agathon,
during the reign of Constantine Pogonat.</i> By the sixth synod of
Constantinople (canon 82) it was ordained that instead of the ancient
symbol, which had been the <span class="smcap">Lamb</span>, <i>the figure of a man fastened to a
cross</i> (such as the <i>Pagans</i> had adored), should be represented. All
this was confirmed by Pope Adrian I.<a name="FNanchor_202:5_1040" id="FNanchor_202:5_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_202:5_1040" class="fnanchor">[202:5]</a></p>

<p>A simple cross, which was the symbol of eternal life, or of salvation,
among the ancients, was sometimes, as we have seen, placed alongside of
the <i>Lamb</i>. In the course of time, the <i>Lamb</i> was put on the cross, as
the ancient <i>Israelites</i> had put the paschal lamb centuries
before,<a name="FNanchor_202:6_1041" id="FNanchor_202:6_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_202:6_1041" class="fnanchor">[202:6]</a> and then, as we have seen, they put a <i>man</i> upon it.</p>

<p>Christ Jesus is also represented in early art as the "Good Shepherd,"
that is, as a young man with a lamb on his shoulders.<a name="FNanchor_202:7_1042" id="FNanchor_202:7_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_202:7_1042" class="fnanchor">[202:7]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
This is just the manner in which the Pagan Apollo, Mercury and others
were represented centuries before.<a name="FNanchor_203:1_1043" id="FNanchor_203:1_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_203:1_1043" class="fnanchor">[203:1]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Jameson says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Mercury</i> attired as a <i>shepherd</i>, with a <i>ram</i> on his
shoulders, borne in the same manner as in many of the
Christian representations, was no unfrequent object (in
ancient art) and in some instances led to a difficulty in
distinguishing between the two,"<a name="FNanchor_203:2_1044" id="FNanchor_203:2_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_203:2_1044" class="fnanchor">[203:2]</a> that is, between
<i>Mercury</i> and <i>Christ Jesus</i>.</p></div>

<p>M. Renan says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Good Shepherd of the catacombs in Rome is a copy from the
<i>Aristeus</i>, or from the <i>Apollo Nomius</i>, which figured in the
same posture on the <i>Pagan</i> sarcophagi; and still carries the
flute of <i>Pan</i>, in the midst of the four half-naked
seasons."<a name="FNanchor_203:3_1045" id="FNanchor_203:3_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_203:3_1045" class="fnanchor">[203:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The Egyptian Saviour <i>Horus</i> was called the "Shepherd of the
People."<a name="FNanchor_203:4_1046" id="FNanchor_203:4_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_203:4_1046" class="fnanchor">[203:4]</a></p>

<p>The Hindoo Saviour <i>Crishna</i> was called the "Royal Good
Shepherd."<a name="FNanchor_203:5_1047" id="FNanchor_203:5_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_203:5_1047" class="fnanchor">[203:5]</a></p>

<p>We have seen, then, on the authority of a Christian writer who has made
the subject a special study, that, "there seems no just grounds at
present for assigning an earlier date," for the "earliest instances of
the crucifixion" of Christ Jesus, represented in art, than the <i>eighth</i>
or <i>ninth</i> century. Now, a few words in regard to <i>what these crucifixes
looked like</i>. If the reader imagines that the crucifixes which are
familiar to us at the present day are similar to those early ones, we
would inform him that such is not the case. The earliest artists of the
crucifixion represent the Christian Saviour as <i>young and beardless</i>,
always without the crown of thorns, alive, and erect, apparently elate;
no signs of bodily suffering are there.<a name="FNanchor_203:6_1048" id="FNanchor_203:6_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_203:6_1048" class="fnanchor">[203:6]</a></p>

<p>On page 151, plate 181, of Jameson's "History of Our Lord in Art" (vol.
ii.), he is represented standing on a foot-rest on the cross, alive, and
eyes open. Again, on page 330, plate 253, he is represented standing
"with body upright and arms extended straight, with <i>no nails</i>, <i>no
wounds</i>, <i>no crown of thorns</i>&mdash;frequently clothed, and with a regal
crown&mdash;a God, young and beautiful, hanging, as it were, without
compulsion or pain."</p>

<p>On page 167, plate 188, are to be seen "the thieves <i>bound</i> to their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span><i>cross (which is simply an upright beam, without cross-bars)</i>, with the
figure of the Lord <i>standing</i> between them." He is not bound nor nailed
to a cross; no cross is there. He is simply standing erect in the form
of a cross. This is a representation of what is styled, "<i>Early
crucifixion with thieves</i>." On page 173, plate 190, we have a
representation of the crucifixion, in which Jesus and the thieves are
represented crucified on the Egyptian <i>tau</i> (see <a href="#Fig_12_15">Fig. No. 12</a>). The
thieves are <i>tied</i>, but the man-god is <i>nailed</i> to the cross. A similar
representation may be seen on page 189, plate 198.</p>

<p>On page 155, plate 183, there is a representation of what is called
"Virgin and St. John at foot of <i>cross</i>," but this <i>cross</i> is simply <i>an
upright beam</i> (as <a href="#Fig_12_15">Fig. No. 13</a>). There are no cross-bars attached. On
page 167, plate 188, the thieves are <i>tied</i> to an upright beam (as <a href="#Fig_12_15">Fig.
13</a>), and Jesus stands between them, <i>with arms extended in the form of a
cross</i>, as the Hindoo Crishna is to be seen in <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. No. 8</a>. On page 157,
plate 185, Jesus is represented crucified on the Egyptian cross (as <a href="#Fig_12_15">No.
12</a>).</p>

<p>Some ancient crucifixes represent the Christian Saviour crucified on a
cross similar in form to the Roman figure which stands for the number
<i>ten</i> (see <a href="#Fig_12_15">Fig. No. 14</a>). Thus we see that there was no uniformity in
representing the "cross of Christ," among the early Christians; even the
cross which Constantine put on his "Labarum," or sacred banner, was
nothing more than the monogram of the Pagan god Osiris (<a href="#Fig_12_15">Fig. No.
15</a>),<a name="FNanchor_204:1_1049" id="FNanchor_204:1_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_204:1_1049" class="fnanchor">[204:1]</a> as we shall see in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">

</div>

<p>The dogma of the <i>vicarious atonement</i> has met with no success whatever
among the Jews. The reason for this is very evident. The idea of
vicarious atonement, in any form, is contrary to Jewish <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>ethics, but it
is in full accord with the <i>Gentile</i>. The <i>law</i> ordains that<a name="FNanchor_205:1_1050" id="FNanchor_205:1_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_205:1_1050" class="fnanchor">[205:1]</a>
"every man shall be put to death for <i>his own</i> sin," and not for the sin
or crime committed by any other person. No ransom should protect the
murderer against the arm of justice.<a name="FNanchor_205:2_1051" id="FNanchor_205:2_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_205:2_1051" class="fnanchor">[205:2]</a> The principle of equal
rights and equal responsibilities is fundamental in the law. If the law
of <i>God</i>&mdash;for as such it is received&mdash;denounces the vicarious atonement,
viz., <i>to slaughter an innocent person to atone for the crimes of
others</i>, then God must abhor it. What is more, Jesus is said to have
sanctioned this law, for is he not made to say: "Think not that I am
come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but
to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one
jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law."<a name="FNanchor_205:3_1052" id="FNanchor_205:3_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_205:3_1052" class="fnanchor">[205:3]</a></p>

<p>"Salvation is and can be nothing else than learning the laws of life and
keeping them. There is, in the modern world, neither place nor need for
any of the theological 'schemes of salvation' or theological 'Saviours.'
No wrath of either God or devil stands in man's way; and therefore no
'sacrifice' is needed to get them out of the way. Jesus saves only as he
helps men know and keep God's laws. Thousands of other men, in their
degree, are Saviours in precisely the same way. As there has been no
'fall of man,' all the hundreds of theological devices for obviating its
supposed effects are only imaginary cures for imaginary ills. What man
does need is to be taught the necessary laws of life, and have brought
to bear upon him adequate motives for obeying them. To know and keep
God's laws is being reconciled to him. This is health; and out of
health&mdash;that is, the perfect condition of the whole man, called holiness
or wholeness&mdash;comes happiness, in this world and in all worlds."</p>

heresy</i>," one of the charges made against him (Sept. 8, 1881) was that
he had said "the <span class="smcap">Blood</span> of the Lamb had nothing to do with salvation."
And in a sermon preached in Boston, Sept. 2, 1881, at the Columbus
Avenue Presbyterian Church, by the Rev. Andrew A. Bonar. D. D., the
preacher said: "No sinner dares to meet the holy God until his sin has
been forgiven, or until he has received <i>remission</i>. The penalty of sin
is death, <i>and this penalty is not remitted by anything the sinner can
do for himself</i>, but only through the <span class="smcap">Blood</span> of Jesus. If you have
accepted Jesus as your Saviour, you can take the blood of Jesus, and
with boldness present it to the Father <i>as payment in full of the
penalties of all your sins</i>. Sinful man has no right to the benefits and
the beauties and glories of nature. <i>These were all lost to him through
Adam's sin</i>, but to the blood of Christ's sacrifice he has a right; it
was shed for him. It is Christ's death that does the blessed work of
salvation for us. It was <i>not</i> his life nor his Incarnation. His
Incarnation could not pay a farthing of our debt, but his <i>blood</i> shed
in redeeming love, <i>pays it all</i>." (See Boston Advertiser, Sept. 3,
1881.)</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>THE DARKNESS AT THE CRUCIFIXION.</h3>

<p>The <i>Luke</i> narrator informs us that at the time of the death of Christ
Jesus, the sun was darkened, and there was darkness over the earth from
the sixth until the ninth hour; also the veil of the temple was rent in
the midst.<a name="FNanchor_206:1_1053" id="FNanchor_206:1_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_206:1_1053" class="fnanchor">[206:1]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Matthew</i> narrator, in addition to this, tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The earth did quake, and the rocks were rent, and the graves
were opened, <i>and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,
and came out of their graves</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and went into the holy city
and appeared unto many."<a name="FNanchor_206:2_1054" id="FNanchor_206:2_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_206:2_1054" class="fnanchor">[206:2]</a></p></div>

<p>"<i>His star</i>" having shone at the time of his birth, and his having been
born in a miraculous manner, it was necessary that at the death of
Christ Jesus, something miraculous should happen. Something of an
unusual nature had happened at the time of the death of other
supernatural beings, therefore something must happen at <i>his</i> death;
<i>the myth would not have been complete without it</i>. In the words of
Viscount Amberly: "The darkness from the sixth to the ninth hour, the
rending of the temple veil, the earthquake, the rending of the rocks,
<i>are altogether like the prodigies attending the decease of other great
men</i>."<a name="FNanchor_206:3_1055" id="FNanchor_206:3_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_206:3_1055" class="fnanchor">[206:3]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Geikie, one of the most orthodox writers, says:<a name="FNanchor_206:4_1056" id="FNanchor_206:4_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_206:4_1056" class="fnanchor">[206:4]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is impossible to explain the <i>origin</i> of this darkness.
The passover moon was then at the full, so that it could not
have been an <i>eclipse</i>. The early Fathers, relying on a notice
of <i>an</i> eclipse that <i>seemed</i> to coincide in time, though it
really <i>did not</i>, fancied that the darkness was caused by it,
but incorrectly."</p></div>

<p>Perhaps "the <i>origin</i> of this darkness" may be explained from what we
shall now see.</p>

<p>At the time of the death of the Hindoo Saviour <i>Crishna</i>, there <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>came
calamities and bad omens of every kind. A black circle surrounded the
moon, <i>and the sun was darkened at noon-day</i>; the sky rained fire and
ashes; flames burned dusky and livid; demons committed depredations on
earth; at sunrise and sunset, thousands of figures were seen skirmishing
in the air; spirits were to be seen on all sides.<a name="FNanchor_207:1_1057" id="FNanchor_207:1_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_207:1_1057" class="fnanchor">[207:1]</a></p>

<p>When the conflict began between <i>Buddha</i>, the Saviour of the World, and
the Prince of Evil, <i>a thousand appalling meteors fell; clouds and
darkness prevailed</i>. Even this earth, with the oceans and mountains it
contains, though it is unconscious, <i>quaked like a conscious
being</i>&mdash;like a fond bride when forcibly torn from her bridegroom&mdash;like
the festoons of a vine shaken under the blast of a whirlwind. The ocean
rose under the vibration of this earthquake; rivers flowed back toward
their sources; peaks of lofty mountains, where countless trees had grown
for ages, rolled crumbling to the earth; a fierce storm howled all
around; the roar of the concussion became terrific; <i>the very sun
enveloped itself in awful darkness, and a host of headless spirits
filled the air</i>.<a name="FNanchor_207:2_1058" id="FNanchor_207:2_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_207:2_1058" class="fnanchor">[207:2]</a></p>

<p>When <i>Prometheus</i> was crucified on Mount Caucasus, <i>the whole frame of
nature became convulsed</i>. The earth did quake, thunder roared, lightning
flashed, the wild winds rent the vexed air, the boisterous billows rose,
and the dissolution of the universe seemed to be threatened.<a name="FNanchor_207:3_1059" id="FNanchor_207:3_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_207:3_1059" class="fnanchor">[207:3]</a></p>

<p>The ancient Greeks and Romans, says Canon Farrar,<a name="FNanchor_207:4_1060" id="FNanchor_207:4_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_207:4_1060" class="fnanchor">[207:4]</a> had always
considered that the <i>births</i> and <i>deaths</i> of great men were announced by
<i>celestial signs</i>. We therefore find that at the death of <i>Romulus</i>, the
founder of Rome, the sun was darkened, <i>and there was darkness over the
face of the earth for the space of six hours</i>.<a name="FNanchor_207:5_1061" id="FNanchor_207:5_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_207:5_1061" class="fnanchor">[207:5]</a></p>

<p>When <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, who was the son of a god, was murdered, there was a
darkness over the earth, <i>the sun being eclipsed for the space of six
hours</i>.<a name="FNanchor_207:6_1062" id="FNanchor_207:6_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_207:6_1062" class="fnanchor">[207:6]</a></p>

<p>This is spoken of by <i>Virgil</i>, where he says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He (the Sun) covered his luminous head with a sooty darkness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And the impious ages feared eternal night."<a name="FNanchor_207:7_1063" id="FNanchor_207:7_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_207:7_1063" class="fnanchor">[207:7]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is also referred to by Tibullus, Ovid, and Lucian (poets), Pliny,
Appian, Dion Cassius, and Julius Obsequenes (historians.)<a name="FNanchor_207:8_1064" id="FNanchor_207:8_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_207:8_1064" class="fnanchor">[207:8]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p><p>When <i>&AElig;sculapius</i> the Saviour was put to death, <i>the sun shone dimly
from the heavens</i>; the birds were silent in the darkened groves; the
trees bowed down their heads in sorrow; and the hearts of all the sons
of men fainted within them, because the healer of their pains and
sickness lived no more upon the earth.<a name="FNanchor_208:1_1065" id="FNanchor_208:1_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_208:1_1065" class="fnanchor">[208:1]</a></p>

<p>When <i>Hercules</i> was dying, he said to the faithful female (Iole) who
followed him to the last spot on earth on which he trod, "Weep not, my
toil is done, and now is the time for rest. I shall see thee again in
the bright land which is never trodden by the feet of night." Then, as
the dying god expired, <i>darkness was on the face of the earth</i>; from the
high heaven came down the thick cloud, <i>and the din of its thunder
crashed through the air</i>. In this manner, Zeus, the god of gods, carried
his son home, and the halls of Olympus were opened to welcome the bright
hero who rested from his mighty toil. There he now sits, clothed in a
white robe, with a crown upon his head.<a name="FNanchor_208:2_1066" id="FNanchor_208:2_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_208:2_1066" class="fnanchor">[208:2]</a></p>

<p>When <i>&OElig;dipus</i> was about to leave this world of pain and sorrow, he
bade Antigone farewell, and said, "Weep not, my child, I am going to my
home, and I rejoice to lay down the burden of my woe." Then there were
<i>signs</i> in the heaven above and on the earth beneath, that the end was
nigh at hand, <i>for the earth did quake, and the thunder roared</i> and
echoed again and again through the sky.<a name="FNanchor_208:3_1067" id="FNanchor_208:3_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_208:3_1067" class="fnanchor">[208:3]</a></p>

<p>"The Romans had a god called <i>Quirinius</i>. His soul emanated from the
sun, and was restored to it. He was begotten by the god of armies upon a
<i>virgin</i> of the royal blood, and exposed by order of the jealous tyrant
Amulius, and was preserved and educated among <i>shepherds</i>. He was torn
to pieces at his death, when he ascended into heaven; <i>upon which the
sun was eclipsed or darkened</i>."<a name="FNanchor_208:4_1068" id="FNanchor_208:4_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_208:4_1068" class="fnanchor">[208:4]</a></p>

<p>When <i>Alexander the Great</i> died, similar prodigies are said to have
happened; again, when foul murders were committed, it is said that the
sun seemed to hide its face. This is illustrated in the story of
<i>Atreus</i>, King of Mycenae, who foully murdered the children of his
brother Thyestes. At that time, the sun, unable to endure a sight so
horrible, "<i>turned his course backward and withdrew his light.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_208:5_1069" id="FNanchor_208:5_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_208:5_1069" class="fnanchor">[208:5]</a></p>

<p>At the time of the death of the virgin-born <i>Quetzalcoatle</i>, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>Mexican crucified Saviour, <i>the sun was darkened</i>, and withheld its
light.<a name="FNanchor_209:1_1070" id="FNanchor_209:1_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_209:1_1070" class="fnanchor">[209:1]</a></p>

<p>Lord Kingsborough, speaking of this event, considers it very strange
that the Mexicans should have preserved an account of it among their
records, when "the great eclipse which sacred history records" is <i>not</i>
recorded in profane history.</p>

<p>Gibbon, the historian, speaking of this phenomenon, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Under the reign of Tiberius, the whole earth,<a name="FNanchor_209:2_1071" id="FNanchor_209:2_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_209:2_1071" class="fnanchor">[209:2]</a> or at
least a celebrated province of the Roman empire,<a name="FNanchor_209:3_1072" id="FNanchor_209:3_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_209:3_1072" class="fnanchor">[209:3]</a> was
involved in a perpetual darkness of three hours. Even this
miraculous event, which ought to have excited the wonder, the
curiosity, and the devotion of mankind, passed without notice
in an age of science and history. It happened during the
life-time of Seneca<a name="FNanchor_209:4_1073" id="FNanchor_209:4_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_209:4_1073" class="fnanchor">[209:4]</a> and the elder Pliny,<a name="FNanchor_209:5_1074" id="FNanchor_209:5_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_209:5_1074" class="fnanchor">[209:5]</a> who
must have experienced the immediate effects, or received the
earliest intelligence, of the prodigy. Each of these
philosophers, in a laborious work, has recorded all the great
phenomena of nature, earthquakes, meteors, comets and
eclipses, which his indefatigable curiosity could
collect.<a name="FNanchor_209:6_1075" id="FNanchor_209:6_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_209:6_1075" class="fnanchor">[209:6]</a> But the one and the other have omitted to
mention the greatest phenomenon to which the mortal eye has
been witness since the creation of the globe."<a name="FNanchor_209:7_1076" id="FNanchor_209:7_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_209:7_1076" class="fnanchor">[209:7]</a></p></div>

<p>This account of the darkness at the time of the death of Jesus of
Nazareth, is one of the prodigies related in the New Testament which no
Christian commentator has been able to make appear reasonable. The
favorite theory is that it was a <i>natural</i> eclipse of the sun, which
<i>happened</i> to take place at that particular time, but, if this was the
case, there was nothing <i>supernatural</i> in the event, and it had nothing
whatever to do with the death of Jesus. Again, it would be necessary to
prove from other sources that such an event happened at that time, but
this cannot be done. The argument from the duration of the
darkness&mdash;<i>three hours</i>&mdash;is also of great force against such an
occurrence having happened, <i>for an eclipse seldom lasts in great
intensity more than six minutes</i>.</p>

<p>Even if it could be proved that an eclipse really happened at the time
assigned for the crucifixion of Jesus, how about the earthquake, when
the rocks were rent and the graves opened? and how about the "saints
which slept" rising <i>bodily</i> and walking in the streets of the Holy City
and <i>appearing to many</i>? Surely, the faith that would remove
mountains,<a name="FNanchor_209:8_1077" id="FNanchor_209:8_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_209:8_1077" class="fnanchor">[209:8]</a> is required here.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p><p>Shakespeare has embalmed some traditions of the kind exactly analogous
to the present case:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In the most high and palmy state of Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets."<a name="FNanchor_210:1_1078" id="FNanchor_210:1_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_210:1_1078" class="fnanchor">[210:1]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Belief in the influence of the <i>stars</i> over life and death, <i>and in
special portents at the death of great men</i>, survived, indeed, to recent
times. Chaucer abounds in allusions to it, and still later Shakespeare
tells us:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When beggars die there are no comets seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It would seem that this superstition survives even to the present day,
for it is well known that the dark and yellow atmosphere which settled
over so much of the country, on the day of the removal of President
Garfield from Washington to Long Branch, was sincerely held by hundreds
of persons to be a death-warning sent from heaven, and there were
numerous predictions that dissolution would take place before the train
arrived at its destination.</p>

<p>As Mr. Greg remarks, there can, we think, remain little doubt in
unprepossessed minds, that the whole legend in question was one of those
intended to magnify Christ Jesus, which were current in great numbers at
the time the Matthew narrator wrote, and which he, with the usual want
of discrimination and somewhat omnivorous tendency, which distinguished
him as a compiler, admitted into his Gospel.</p>

<h3>"HE DESCENDED INTO HELL."</h3>

<p>The doctrine of Christ Jesus' descent into hell is emphatically part of
the Christian belief, although not alluded to by Christian divines
excepting when unavoidable.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is taught in the <i>Creed</i> of the Christians,
wherein it says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>He descended into hell, and on the third day he rose again
from the dead.</i>"</p></div>

<p>The doctrine was also taught by the Fathers of the Church. St.
Chrysostom (born 347 <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span>) asks:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Who but an infidel would deny that Christ was in
hell?"<a name="FNanchor_211:1_1079" id="FNanchor_211:1_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_211:1_1079" class="fnanchor">[211:1]</a></p></div>

<p>And St. Clement of Alexandria, who flourished at the beginning of the
third century, is equally clear and emphatic as to Jesus' descent into
hell. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Lord preached the gospel to those in Hades, as well as to
all in earth, in order that all might believe and be saved,
wherever they were. If, then, the Lord descended to Hades for
no other end but to preach the gospel, <i>as He did descend</i>, it
was either to preach the gospel to all, or to the Hebrews
only. If accordingly to all, then all who believe shall be
saved, although they may be of the Gentiles, on making their
profession there."<a name="FNanchor_211:2_1080" id="FNanchor_211:2_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_211:2_1080" class="fnanchor">[211:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Origen, who flourished during the latter part of the second, and
beginning of the third centuries, also emphatically declares that Christ
Jesus descended into hell.<a name="FNanchor_211:3_1081" id="FNanchor_211:3_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_211:3_1081" class="fnanchor">[211:3]</a></p>

<p>Ancient Christian works of art represent his descent into hell.<a name="FNanchor_211:4_1082" id="FNanchor_211:4_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_211:4_1082" class="fnanchor">[211:4]</a></p>

<p>The apocryphal gospels teach the doctrine of Christ Jesus' descent into
hell, the object of which was to preach to those in bondage there, and
to liberate the <i>saints</i> who had died before his advent on earth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p><p>On account of the sin committed by Adam in the Garden of Eden, all
mankind were doomed, all had gone to hell&mdash;excepting those who had been
translated to heaven&mdash;even those persons who were "after God's own
heart," and who had belonged to his "chosen people." The coming of
Christ Jesus into the world, however, made a change in the affairs of
man. The <i>saints</i> were then liberated from their prison, and all those
who believe in the efficacy of his name, shall escape hereafter the
tortures of hell. This is the doctrine to be found in the apocryphal
gospels, and was taught by the Fathers of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_212:1_1083" id="FNanchor_212:1_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_212:1_1083" class="fnanchor">[212:1]</a></p>

<p>In the "<i>Gospel of Nicodemus</i>" (apoc.) is to be found the whole story of
Christ Jesus' descent into hell, and of his liberating the saints.</p>

<p>Satan, and the Prince of Hell, having heard that Jesus of Nazareth was
about to descend to their domain, began to talk the matter over, as to
what they should do, &amp;c. While thus engaged, on a sudden, there was a
voice as of thunder and the rushing of winds, saying: "Lift up your
gates, O ye Princes, and be ye lifted up, O ye everlasting gates, and
the King of Glory shall come in."</p>

<p>When the Prince of Hell heard this, he said to his impious officers:
"Shut the brass gates .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and make them fast with iron bars, and fight
courageously."</p>

<p>The <i>saints</i> having heard what had been said on both sides, immediately
spoke with a loud voice, saying: "Open thy gates, that the King of Glory
may come in." The divine prophets, <i>David</i> and <i>Isaiah</i>, were
particularly conspicuous in this protest against the intentions of the
Prince of Hell.</p>

<p>Again the voice of Jesus was heard saying: "Lift up your gates, O
Prince; and be ye lifted up, ye gates of hell, and the King of Glory
will enter in." The Prince of Hell then cried out: "Who is the King of
Glory?" upon which the prophet <i>David</i> commenced to reply to him, but
while he was speaking, the mighty Lord Jesus appeared in the form of a
man, and broke asunder the fetters which before could not be broken, and
crying aloud, said: "Come to me, all ye saints, who were created in my
image, who were condemned by the tree of the forbidden fruit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. live
now by the word of my cross."</p>

<p>Then presently all the saints were joined together, hand in hand, and
the Lord Jesus laid hold on Adam's hand, and ascended from hell, and all
the saints of God followed him.<a name="FNanchor_212:2_1084" id="FNanchor_212:2_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_212:2_1084" class="fnanchor">[212:2]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p><p>When the saints arrived in paradise, two "very ancient men" met them,
and were asked by the saints: "Who are ye, who have not been with us in
hell, and have had your bodies placed in paradise?" One of these "very
ancient men" answered and said: "I am <i>Enoch</i>, who was translated by the
word of God, and this man who is with me is Elijah the Tishbite, who was
translated in a fiery chariot."<a name="FNanchor_213:1_1085" id="FNanchor_213:1_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_213:1_1085" class="fnanchor">[213:1]</a></p>

<p>The doctrine of the descent into hell may be found alluded to in the
<i>canonical</i> books; thus, for instance, in I. Peter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
well doing, than for evil doing. For Christ also hath suffered
for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to
God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the
spirit: <i>by which also he went and preached unto the spirits
in prison</i>."<a name="FNanchor_213:2_1086" id="FNanchor_213:2_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_213:2_1086" class="fnanchor">[213:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Again, in "Acts," where the writer is speaking of David as a <i>prophet</i>,
he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He, seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ,
<i>that his soul was not left in hell</i>, neither his flesh did
see corruption."<a name="FNanchor_213:3_1087" id="FNanchor_213:3_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_213:3_1087" class="fnanchor">[213:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The reason why Christ Jesus has been made to descend into hell, is
because <i>it is a part of the universal mythos</i>, even the <i>three days'</i>
duration. The <i>Saviours</i> of mankind had all done so, <i>he</i> must therefore
do likewise.</p>

<p><i>Crishna</i>, the Hindoo Saviour, <i>descended into hell</i>, for the purpose of
raising the dead (the doomed),<a name="FNanchor_213:4_1088" id="FNanchor_213:4_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_213:4_1088" class="fnanchor">[213:4]</a> before he returned to his heavenly

<h3>THE RESURRECTION AND ASCENSION OF CHRIST JESUS.</h3>

<p>The story of the resurrection of Christ Jesus is related by the four
Gospel narrators, and is to the effect that, after being crucified, his
body was wrapped in a linen cloth, laid in a tomb, and a "great stone"
rolled to the door. The sepulchre was then made sure by "sealing the
stone" and "setting a watch."</p>

<p>On the first day of the week some of Jesus' followers came to see the
sepulchre, when they found that, in spite of the "sealing" and the
"watch," the angel of the Lord had descended from heaven, had rolled
back the stone from the door, and that "<i>Jesus had risen from the
dead</i>."<a name="FNanchor_215:1_1099" id="FNanchor_215:1_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_215:1_1099" class="fnanchor">[215:1]</a></p>

<p>The story of his <i>ascension</i> is told by the <i>Mark</i><a name="FNanchor_215:2_1100" id="FNanchor_215:2_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_215:2_1100" class="fnanchor">[215:2]</a> narrator, who
says "he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God;"
by <i>Luke</i>,<a name="FNanchor_215:3_1101" id="FNanchor_215:3_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_215:3_1101" class="fnanchor">[215:3]</a> who says "he was carried up into heaven;" and by the
writer of the <i>Acts</i>,<a name="FNanchor_215:4_1102" id="FNanchor_215:4_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_215:4_1102" class="fnanchor">[215:4]</a> who says "he was taken up (to heaven) and a
cloud received him out of sight."</p>

<p>We will find, in stripping Christianity of its robes of Paganism, that
these miraculous events must be put on the same level with those we have
already examined.</p>

<p><i>Crishna</i>, the crucified Hindoo Saviour, <i>rose from the dead</i>,<a name="FNanchor_215:5_1103" id="FNanchor_215:5_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_215:5_1103" class="fnanchor">[215:5]</a>
and <i>ascended bodily into heaven</i>.<a name="FNanchor_215:6_1104" id="FNanchor_215:6_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_215:6_1104" class="fnanchor">[215:6]</a> At that time a great light
enveloped the earth and illuminated the whole expanse of heaven.
Attended by celestial spirits, and luminous as on that night when he was
born in the house of Vasudeva, <i>Crishna</i> pursued, by his own light, the
journey between earth and heaven, to the bright paradise from whence he
had descended. All men saw him, and exclaimed, "<i>Lo, Crishna's soul
ascends its native skies!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_215:7_1105" id="FNanchor_215:7_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_215:7_1105" class="fnanchor">[215:7]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p><p>Samuel Johnson, in his "Oriental Religions," tells us that <i>R&acirc;ma</i>&mdash;an
incarnation of Vishnu&mdash;after his manifestations on earth, "<i>at last
ascended to heaven</i>," "resuming his divine essence."</p>

<p>"By the blessings of R&acirc;ma's name, and through previous faith in him, all
sins are remitted, and every one who shall at death pronounce his name
with sincere worship shall be forgiven."<a name="FNanchor_216:1_1106" id="FNanchor_216:1_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_216:1_1106" class="fnanchor">[216:1]</a></p>

<p>The mythological account of <i>Buddha</i>, the son of the Virgin Maya, who,
as the God of Love, is named <i>Cam-deo</i>, <i>Cam</i>, and <i>Cama</i>, is of the
same character as that of other virgin-born gods. When he died there
were tears and lamentations. Heaven and earth are said equally to have
lamented the loss of "<i>Divine Love</i>," insomuch that <i>Maha-deo</i> (the
supreme god) was moved to pity, and exclaimed, "<i>Rise, holy love!</i>" on
which <i>Cama</i> was restored and the lamentations changed into the most
enthusiastic joy. The heavens are said to have echoed back the exulting
sound; then the deity, supposed to be lost (<i>dead</i>), was restored,
"<i>hell's great dread and heaven's eternal admiration</i>."<a name="FNanchor_216:2_1107" id="FNanchor_216:2_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_216:2_1107" class="fnanchor">[216:2]</a></p>

<p>The coverings of the body unrolled themselves, and the lid of his coffin
was opened by supernatural powers.<a name="FNanchor_216:3_1108" id="FNanchor_216:3_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_216:3_1108" class="fnanchor">[216:3]</a></p>

<p><i>Buddha</i> also ascended bodily to the celestial regions when his mission
on earth was fulfilled, and marks on the rocks of a high mountain are
shown, and believed to be the last impression of his footsteps on this
earth. By prayers in his name his followers expect to receive the
rewards of paradise, and finally to become one with him, as he became
one with the Source of Life.<a name="FNanchor_216:4_1109" id="FNanchor_216:4_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_216:4_1109" class="fnanchor">[216:4]</a></p>

<p><i>Lao-Kiun</i>, the virgin-born, he who had existed from all eternity, when
his mission of benevolence was completed on earth, <i>ascended bodily into
the paradise above</i>. Since this time he has been worshiped as a <i>god</i>,
and splendid temples erected to his memory.<a name="FNanchor_216:5_1110" id="FNanchor_216:5_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_216:5_1110" class="fnanchor">[216:5]</a></p>

<p><i>Zoroaster</i>, the founder of the religion of the ancient Persians, who
was considered "a divine messenger sent to redeem men from their evil
ways," <i>ascended to heaven</i> at the end of his earthly career. To this
day his followers mention him with the greatest reverence, calling him
"The Immortal Zoroaster," "The Blessed Zoroaster," "The Living Star,"

<p>The Saviour <i>Adonis</i> or <i>Tammuz</i>, after being put to death, <i>rose from
the dead</i>. The following is an account given of the rites of Tammuz or
of Adonis by Julius Firmicius (who lived during the reign of
Constantine):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On a certain night (while the ceremony of the Adonia, or
religious rites in honor of Adonis, lasted), an image was laid
upon a bed (or bier) and bewailed in doleful ditties. After
they had satiated themselves with fictitious lamentations,
light was brought in: then the mouths of all the mourners were
anointed by the priests (<i>with oil</i>), upon which he, with a
gentle murmur, whispered:</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Trust, ye Saints, your God restored.<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Trust ye, <i>in your risen Lord</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">For the pains which he endured<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Our salvation have procured.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Literally, 'Trust, ye <i>communicants</i>: the God having been
saved, there shall be to us out of pain, <i>Salvation</i>.'"<a name="FNanchor_217:2_1113" id="FNanchor_217:2_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_217:2_1113" class="fnanchor">[217:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Upon which their sorrow was turned into joy.</p>

<p>Godwyn renders it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Trust ye in God, for out of pains,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0i"><i>Salvation is come unto us.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_217:3_1114" id="FNanchor_217:3_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_217:3_1114" class="fnanchor">[217:3]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dr. Prichard, in his "<i>Egyptian Mythology</i>," tells us that the Syrians
celebrated, <i>in the early spring</i>, this ceremony in honor of <i>the
resurrection of Adonis</i>. After lamentations, his restoration was
commemorated with joy and festivity.<a name="FNanchor_217:4_1115" id="FNanchor_217:4_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_217:4_1115" class="fnanchor">[217:4]</a></p>

<p>Mons. Dupuis says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The obsequies of <i>Adonis</i> were celebrated at <i>Alexandria</i> (in
Egypt) with the utmost display. His image was carried with
great solemnity to a tomb, which served the purpose of
rendering him the last honors. Before singing his return <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>to
life, there were mournful rites celebrated in honor of his
suffering and his death. The large wound he had received was
shown, just as the wound was shown which was made to Christ by
the thrust of the spear. <i>The feast of his resurrection was
fixed at the 25th of March.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_218:1_1116" id="FNanchor_218:1_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_218:1_1116" class="fnanchor">[218:1]</a></p></div>

<p>In Calmet's "Fragments," the resurrection of <i>Adonis</i> is referred to as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In these <i>mysteries</i>, after the attendants had for a long
time bewailed the death of this <i>just person</i>, he was at
length understood to be <i>restored to life</i>, to have
experienced a <i>resurrection</i>; signified by the re-admission of
light. On this the priest addressed the company, saying,
'Comfort yourselves, all ye who have been partakers of the
mysteries of the deity, thus preserved: for we shall now enjoy
some respite from our labors:' to which were added these
words: 'I have scaped a sad calamity, and my lot is greatly
mended.' The people answered by the invocation: 'Hail to the
Dove! the Restorer of Light!'"<a name="FNanchor_218:2_1117" id="FNanchor_218:2_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_218:2_1117" class="fnanchor">[218:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Alexander Murray tells us that the ancient Greeks also celebrated this
festival in honor of the resurrection of Adonis, in the course of which
a figure of him was produced, and the ceremony of burial, with weeping
and songs of wailing, gone through. After these a joyful shout was
raised: "<i>Adonis lives and is risen again.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_218:3_1118" id="FNanchor_218:3_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_218:3_1118" class="fnanchor">[218:3]</a></p>

<p>Plutarch, in his life of Alcibiades and of Nicias, tells us that it was
at the time of the celebration of the death of <i>Adonis</i> that the
Athenian fleet set sail for its unlucky expedition to Sicily; that
nothing but images of dead Adonises were to be met with in the streets,
and that they were carried to the sepulchre in the midst of an immense
train of women, crying and beating their breasts, and imitating in every
particular the lugubrious pomp of interments. Sinister omens were drawn
from it, which were only too much realized by subsequent events.<a name="FNanchor_218:4_1119" id="FNanchor_218:4_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_218:4_1119" class="fnanchor">[218:4]</a></p>

<p>It was in an oration or address delivered to the Emperors Constans and
Constantius that Julius Firmicius wrote concerning the rites celebrated
by the heathens in commemoration of the resurrection of Adonis. In his
tide of eloquence he breaks away into indignant objurgation of the
priest who officiated in those <i>heathen mysteries</i>, which, he admitted,
resembled the <i>Christian sacrament</i> in honor of the death and
resurrection of Christ Jesus, so closely that there was really no
difference between them, except that no sufficient proof had been given
to the world of the resurrection of Adonis, <i>and no divine oracle had
borne witness to his resurrection</i>, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>nor had he shown himself alive
after his death to those who were concerned to have assurance of the
fact that they might believe.</p>

<p>The <i>divine oracle</i>, be it observed, which Julius Firmicius says had
borne testimony to Christ Jesus' resurrection, <i>was none other than the
answer of the god Apollo, whom the Pagans worshiped at Delphos</i>, which
this writer derived from Porphyry's books "<i>On the Philosophy of
Oracles</i>."<a name="FNanchor_219:1_1120" id="FNanchor_219:1_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_219:1_1120" class="fnanchor">[219:1]</a></p>

<p>Eusebius, the celebrated ecclesiastical historian, has also condescended
to quote this claimed testimony from <i>a Pagan oracle</i>, as furnishing one
of the most convincing proofs that could be adduced in favor of the
resurrection of Christ Jesus.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"But thou at least (says he to the Pagans), <i>listen to thine
own gods, to thy oracular deities themselves</i>, who have borne
witness, and ascribed to our Saviour (Jesus Christ) not
imposture, but piety and wisdom, and ascent into heaven."</p></div>

<p>This was vastly obliging and liberal of the god Apollo, but, it happens
awkwardly enough, that the whole work (consisting of several books)
ascribed to Porphyry, in which this and other admissions equally
honorable to the evidences of the Christian religion are made, was <i>not</i>
written by Porphyry, but is altogether the pious fraud of Christian
hands, who have kindly fathered the great philosopher with admissions,
which, as he would certainly never have made himself, they have very
charitably made for him.<a name="FNanchor_219:2_1121" id="FNanchor_219:2_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_219:2_1121" class="fnanchor">[219:2]</a></p>

<p>The festival in honor of the resurrection of Adonis was observed in
Alexandria in Egypt&mdash;<i>the cradle of Christianity</i>&mdash;in the time of St.
Cyril, Bishop of Alexandria (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 412), and at Antioch&mdash;the ancient
capital of the Greek Kings of Syria&mdash;even as late as the time of the
Emperor Julian (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 361-363), whose arrival there, during the
solemnity of the festival, was taken as an ill omen.<a name="FNanchor_219:3_1122" id="FNanchor_219:3_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_219:3_1122" class="fnanchor">[219:3]</a></p>

<p>It is most curious that the arrival of the Emperor Julian at
Antioch&mdash;where the followers of Christ Jesus, it is said, were first
called Christians&mdash;at that time, should be considered an <i>ill omen</i>. Why
should it have been so? He was not a Christian, but a known apostate
from the Christian religion, and a zealous patron of <i>Paganism</i>. The
evidence is very conclusive; <i>the celebration in honor of the
resurrection of Adonis had become to be known as a Christian festival,
which has not been abolished even unto this day</i>. The ceremonies held in
Roman Catholic countries on Good Friday and on Easter Sunday, are
nothing more than the festival of the death and resurrection of Adonis,
as we shall presently see.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p><p>Even as late as the year <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 386, the resurrection of Adonis was
celebrated in <i>Judea</i>. St. Jerome says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Over Bethlehem (in the year 386 after Christ) the grove of
Tammuz, that is, of Adonis, was casting its shadow! And in the
<i>grotto</i> where formerly the infant Anointed (<i>i. e.</i>, <i>Christ
Jesus</i>) cried, the lover of Venus was being mourned."<a name="FNanchor_220:1_1123" id="FNanchor_220:1_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_220:1_1123" class="fnanchor">[220:1]</a></p></div>

<p>In the idolatrous worship practiced by the <i>children of Israel</i> was that
of the worship of <i>Adonis</i>.</p>

<p>Under the designation of <i>Tammuz</i>, this god was worshiped, and had his
altar even in the Temple of the Lord which was at Jerusalem. Several of
the Psalms of David were parts of the liturgical service employed in his
worship; the 110th, in particular, is an account of a friendly alliance
between the two gods, Jehovah and Adonis, in which Jehovah adorns Adonis
for his priest, as sitting at his right hand, and promises to fight for
him against his enemies. This god was worshiped at Byblis in Ph&oelig;nicia
with precisely the same ceremonies: the same articles of faith as to his
mystical incarnation, his precious death and burial, and his glorious
resurrection and ascension, and even in the very same words of religious
adoration and homage which are now, with the slightest degree of
variation that could well be conceived, addressed to the Christ of the
Gospel.</p>

<p>The prophet Ezekiel, when an exile, painted once more the scene he had
so often witnessed of the Israelitish women in the Temple court
bewailing the death of Tammuz.<a name="FNanchor_220:2_1124" id="FNanchor_220:2_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_220:2_1124" class="fnanchor">[220:2]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Parkhurst says, in his "Hebrew Lexicon":</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I find myself <i>obliged</i> to refer Tammuz, as well as the Greek
and Roman Hercules, to that class of idols <i>which were
originally designed to represent the promised Saviour</i> (Christ
Jesus), the desire of all nations. His other name, Adonis, is
almost the very Hebrew word 'Our Lord,' a well-known title of
Christ."<a name="FNanchor_220:3_1125" id="FNanchor_220:3_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_220:3_1125" class="fnanchor">[220:3]</a></p></div>

<p>So it seems that the ingenious and most learned orthodox Dr. Parkhurst
was <i>obliged</i> to consider Adonis a type of "the promised Saviour (Christ
Jesus), the desire of all nations." This is a very favorite way for
Christian divines to express themselves, when pushed thereto, by the
striking resemblance between the Pagan, virgin-born, crucified, and
resurrected gods and Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>If the reader is satisfied that all these things are types or symbols of
what the "<i>real Saviour</i>" was to do and suffer, he is welcome <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>to such
food. The doctrine of Dr. Parkhurst and others comes with but an ill
grace, however, from Roman Catholic priests, <i>who have never ceased to
suppress information when possible</i>, and when it was impossible for them
to do so, they claimed these things to be the work of the devil, in
imitation of their predecessors, the Christian Fathers.</p>

<p>Julius Firmicius has said: "The devil has his Christs," and does not
deny that <i>Adonis</i> was one. Tertullian and St. Justin explain all the
conformity which exists between <i>Christianity</i> and <i>Paganism</i>, by
asserting "that a long time before there were Christians in existence,
the devil had taken pleasure to have their future mysteries and
ceremonies copied by his worshipers."<a name="FNanchor_221:1_1126" id="FNanchor_221:1_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_221:1_1126" class="fnanchor">[221:1]</a></p>

<p><i>Osiris</i>, the Egyptian Saviour, after being put to death, <i>rose from the
dead</i>,<a name="FNanchor_221:2_1127" id="FNanchor_221:2_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_221:2_1127" class="fnanchor">[221:2]</a> and bore the title of "<i>The Resurrected One</i>."<a name="FNanchor_221:3_1128" id="FNanchor_221:3_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_221:3_1128" class="fnanchor">[221:3]</a></p>

<p>Prof. Mahaffy, lecturer on ancient history in the University of Dublin,
observes that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>Resurrection</i> and reign over an eternal kingdom, by an
<i>incarnate mediating deity</i> born of a virgin, was a
theological conception which pervaded the oldest religion of
Egypt."<a name="FNanchor_221:4_1129" id="FNanchor_221:4_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_221:4_1129" class="fnanchor">[221:4]</a></p></div>

<p>The ancient Egyptians celebrated annually, in early spring, about the
time known in Christian countries as Easter, the resurrection and
ascension of Osiris. During these mysteries the misfortunes and tragical
death of the "<i>Saviour</i>" were celebrated in a species of drama, in which
all the particulars were exhibited, accompanied with loud lamentations
and every mark of sorrow. At this time his image was carried in a
procession, covered&mdash;as were those in the temples&mdash;<i>with black veils</i>.
On the 25th of March his <i>resurrection from the dead</i> was celebrated
with great festivity and rejoicings.<a name="FNanchor_221:5_1130" id="FNanchor_221:5_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_221:5_1130" class="fnanchor">[221:5]</a></p>

<p>Alexander Murray says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The worship of <i>Osiris</i> was universal throughout Egypt, where
he was gratefully regarded as the great exemplar of
<i>self-sacrifice</i>&mdash;in giving his life for others&mdash;as the
manifestor of good, as the opener of truth, and as being full
of goodness and truth. <i>After being dead, he was restored to
life.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_221:6_1131" id="FNanchor_221:6_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_221:6_1131" class="fnanchor">[221:6]</a></p></div>

<p>Mons. Dupuis says on this subject:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Fathers of the Church, and the writers of the Christian
sect, speak frequently of these feasts, celebrated in honor of
Osiris, <i>who died and arose from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>the dead</i>, and they draw a
parallel with the adventurers of <i>their</i> Christ. Athanasius,
Augustin, Theophilus, Athenagoras, Minucius Felix, Lactantius,
Firmicius, as also the ancient authors who have spoken of
<i>Osiris</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all agree in the description of the universal
mourning of the Egyptians at the festival, when the
commemoration of that death took place. They describe the
ceremonies which were practiced at his sepulchre, the tears,
which were there shed during several days, and the festivities
and rejoicings, which followed after that mourning, at the
moment when his resurrection was announced."<a name="FNanchor_222:1_1132" id="FNanchor_222:1_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_222:1_1132" class="fnanchor">[222:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Mr. Bonwick remarks, in his "Egyptian Belief," that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is astonishing to find that, at least, five thousand years
ago, men trusted an <i>Osiris</i> as the '<i>Risen Saviour</i>,' and
confidently hoped to rise, as he arose, from the
grave."<a name="FNanchor_222:2_1133" id="FNanchor_222:2_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_222:2_1133" class="fnanchor">[222:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Again he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Osiris was, unquestionably, the popular god of Egypt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Osiris was dear to the hearts of the people. He was
pre-eminently '<i>good</i>.' He was in life and death their friend.
His birth, death, burial, resurrection and ascension, embraced
the leading points of Egyptian theology." "In his efforts to
do good, he encounters evil. In struggling with that, he is
overcome. He is killed. The story, entered into in the account
of the Osiris myth, is a circumstantial one. Osiris is buried.
His tomb was the object of pilgrimage for thousands of years.
<i>But he did not rest in his grave. At the end of three days,
or forty, he arose again</i>, and ascended to heaven. This is the
story of his humanity." "As the <i>invictus Osiris</i>, his tomb
was illuminated, as is the holy sepulchre of Jerusalem now.
The mourning song, whose plaintive tones were noted by
Herodotus, and has been compared to the '<i>miserere</i>' of Rome,
was followed, <i>in three days</i>, by the language of
triumph."<a name="FNanchor_222:3_1134" id="FNanchor_222:3_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_222:3_1134" class="fnanchor">[222:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Herodotus, who had been initiated into the Egyptian and Grecian
"<i>Mysteries</i>," speaks thus of them:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"At Sais (in Egypt), in the sacred precinct of Minerva; behind
the chapel and joining the wall, is the tomb of one whose name
I consider it impious to divulge on such an occasion; and in
the inclosure stand large stone obelisks, and there is a lake
near, ornamented with a stone margin, formed in a circle, and
in size, as appeared to me, much the same as that in Delos,
which is called the circular. In this lake they perform by
night the representation of that person's adventures, which
they call <i>mysteries</i>. On these matters, however, though
accurately acquainted with the particulars of them, <i>I must
observe a discreet silence</i>; and respecting the sacred rites
of Ceres, which the Greeks call Thesmyphoria, although I am
acquainted with them, I must observe silence except so far as
is lawful for me to speak of them."<a name="FNanchor_222:4_1135" id="FNanchor_222:4_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_222:4_1135" class="fnanchor">[222:4]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Horus</i>, son of the virgin <i>Isis</i>, experienced similar misfortunes. The
principal features of this sacred romance are to be found in the
writings of the Christian Fathers. They give us a description of the
grief which was manifested at his death, and of the rejoicings at his
<i>resurrection</i>, which are similar to those spoken of above.<a name="FNanchor_222:5_1136" id="FNanchor_222:5_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_222:5_1136" class="fnanchor">[222:5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p><p><i>Atys</i>, the Phrygian Saviour, was put to death, <i>and rose again from
the dead</i>. Various histories were given of him in various places, but
all accounts terminated in the usual manner. He was one of the "Slain
Ones" who rose to life again on the 25th of March, or the "<i>Hilaria</i>" or
primitive Easter.<a name="FNanchor_223:1_1137" id="FNanchor_223:1_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_223:1_1137" class="fnanchor">[223:1]</a></p>

<p><i>Mithras</i>, the Persian Saviour, and mediator between God and man, was
believed by the inhabitants of Persia, Asia Minor and Armenia, to have
been put to death, <i>and to have risen again from the dead</i>. In their
mysteries, the body of a young man, apparently dead, was exhibited,
which was feigned to be restored to life. By his sufferings he was
believed to have worked their salvation, and on this account he was
called their "<i>Saviour</i>." His priests watched his tomb to the midnight
of the veil of the 25th of March, <i>with loud cries, and in darkness</i>;
when all at once the lights burst forth from all parts, and the priest
cried:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Rejoice, Oh sacred Initiated, your god is risen. His death,
his pains, his sufferings, have worked our salvation.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_223:2_1138" id="FNanchor_223:2_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_223:2_1138" class="fnanchor">[223:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Mons. Dupuis, speaking of the resurrection of this god, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is chiefly in the religion of <i>Mithras</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that we find
mostly these features of analogy with the death and
resurrection of Christ, and with the mysteries of the
Christians. <i>Mithras</i>, who was also born on the 25th of
December, like Christ, died as he did; and he had his
sepulchre, over which his disciples came to shed tears. During
the night, the priests carried his image to a tomb, expressly
prepared for him; he was laid out on a litter, like the
Ph&oelig;nician <i>Adonis</i>.</p>

<p>"These funeral ceremonies, like those on Good Friday (in Roman
Catholic churches), were accompanied with funeral dirges and
groans of the priests; after having spent some time with these
expressions of feigned grief; after having lighted the sacred
<i>flambeau</i>, or their paschal candle, and anointed the image
with <i>chrism</i> or perfumes, one of them came forward and
pronounced with the gravest mien these words: '<i>Be of good
cheer, sacred band of Initiates, your god has risen from the
dead. His pains and his sufferings shall be your
salvation.</i>'"<a name="FNanchor_223:3_1139" id="FNanchor_223:3_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_223:3_1139" class="fnanchor">[223:3]</a></p></div>

<p>In King's "<i>Gnostics and their Remains</i>" (Plate XI.), may be seen the
representation of a bronze medal, or rather disk, engraved <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>in the
coarsest manner, on which is to be seen a female figure, standing in the
attitude of adoration, the object of which is expressed by the
inscription&mdash;<span class="allcapsc">ORTVS SALVAT</span>, "<i>The Rising of the Saviour</i>"&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, of

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This medal" (says Mr. King), "doubtless had accompanied the

<p><i>Bacchus</i>, the Saviour, son of the virgin Semele, after being put to
death, also <i>arose from the dead</i>. During the commemoration of the
ceremonies of this event the dead body of a young man was exhibited with
great lamentations, in the same manner as the cases cited above, and at
dawn on the 25th of March his resurrection from the dead was celebrated
with great rejoicings.<a name="FNanchor_224:3_1142" id="FNanchor_224:3_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_224:3_1142" class="fnanchor">[224:3]</a> After having brought solace to the

<p><i>Hercules</i>, the Saviour, the son of Zeus by a mortal mother, was put to
death, but arose from the funeral pile, <i>and ascended into heaven</i> in a
<i>cloud</i>, 'mid peals of thunder. His followers manifested gratitude to
his memory by erecting an altar on the spot from whence be
ascended.<a name="FNanchor_224:5_1144" id="FNanchor_224:5_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_224:5_1144" class="fnanchor">[224:5]</a></p>

<p><i>Memnon</i> is put to death, but rises again to life and immortality. His
mother Eos weeps tears at the death of her son&mdash;as Mary does for Christ
Jesus&mdash;but her prayers avail to bring him back, like Adonis or Tammuz,
and Jesus, from the shadowy region, to dwell always in Olympus.<a name="FNanchor_224:6_1145" id="FNanchor_224:6_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_224:6_1145" class="fnanchor">[224:6]</a></p>

<p>The ancient Greeks also believed that <i>Amphiaraus</i>&mdash;one of their most
celebrated prophets and demi-gods&mdash;<i>rose from the dead</i>. They even
pointed to the place of his resurrection.<a name="FNanchor_224:7_1146" id="FNanchor_224:7_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_224:7_1146" class="fnanchor">[224:7]</a></p>

<p><i>Baldur</i>, the Scandinavian Lord and Saviour, is put to death, but does
not rest in his grave. He too rises again to life and
immortality.<a name="FNanchor_224:8_1147" id="FNanchor_224:8_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_224:8_1147" class="fnanchor">[224:8]</a></p>

<p>When "Baldur the Good," the beneficent god, descended into hell, Hela
(Death) said to Hermod (who mourned for Baldur): "If all things in the
world, both living and lifeless, weep for him, then shall he return to
the &AElig;sir (the gods)." Upon hearing this, messengers were dispatched
throughout the world to beg everything <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>to weep in order that Baldur
might be delivered from hell. All things everywhere willingly complied
with this request, both men and every other living being, so that
<i>wailing</i> was heard in all quarters.<a name="FNanchor_225:1_1148" id="FNanchor_225:1_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_225:1_1148" class="fnanchor">[225:1]</a></p>

<p>Thus we see the same myth among the northern nations. As Bunsen says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The tragedy of the <i>murdered and risen god</i> is familiar to us
from the days of ancient Egypt: must it not be of equally
primeval origin here?" [In Teutonic tradition.]</p></div>

<p>The ancient Scandinavians also worshiped a god called <i>Frey</i>, who was
put to death, <i>and rose again from the dead</i>.<a name="FNanchor_225:2_1149" id="FNanchor_225:2_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_225:2_1149" class="fnanchor">[225:2]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Druids</i> celebrated, in the British Isles, in heathen times,
the rites of the resurrected Bacchus, and other ceremonies, similar to
the Greeks and Romans.<a name="FNanchor_225:3_1150" id="FNanchor_225:3_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_225:3_1150" class="fnanchor">[225:3]</a></p>

<p><i>Quetzalcoatle</i>, the Mexican crucified Saviour, after being put to
death, <i>rose from the dead</i>. His resurrection was represented in Mexican
<i>hieroglyphics</i>, and may be seen in the <i>Codex Borgianus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_225:4_1151" id="FNanchor_225:4_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_225:4_1151" class="fnanchor">[225:4]</a></p>

<p>The Jews in Palestine celebrated their <i>Passover</i> on the same day that
the Pagans celebrated the resurrection of their gods.</p>

<p>Besides the resurrected gods mentioned in this chapter, who were
believed in for centuries before the time assigned for the birth of
Christ Jesus, many others might be named, as we shall see in our chapter
on "<a href="#CHAPTER_XXXIX">Explanation</a>." In the words of Dunbar T. Heath:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We find men taught everywhere, from Southern Arabia to
Greece, by hundreds of symbolisms, the birth, death, and
resurrection of deities, and a resurrection too, apparently
after the second day, <i>i. e.</i>, <i>on the third</i>."<a name="FNanchor_225:5_1152" id="FNanchor_225:5_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_225:5_1152" class="fnanchor">[225:5]</a></p></div>

<p>And now, to conclude all, <i>another god</i> is said to have been born on the
<i>same day</i><a name="FNanchor_225:6_1153" id="FNanchor_225:6_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_225:6_1153" class="fnanchor">[225:6]</a> as these Pagan deities; he is crucified and buried,
and on the <i>same day</i><a name="FNanchor_225:7_1154" id="FNanchor_225:7_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_225:7_1154" class="fnanchor">[225:7]</a> rises again from the dead. Christians of
Europe and America celebrate annually the resurrection of <i>their</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>Saviour in almost the identical manner in which the Pagans celebrated
the resurrection of <i>their</i> Saviours, centuries before the God of the
Christians is said to have been born. In Roman Catholic churches, in
Catholic countries, the body of a young man is laid on a bier, and
placed before the altar; the wound in his side is to be seen, and his
death is bewailed in mournful dirges, and the verse, <i>Gloria Patri</i>, is
discontinued in the mass. All the images in the churches and the altar
<i>are covered with black</i>, and the priest and attendants are robed in
black; nearly all lights are put out, and the windows are darkened. This
is the "Agonie," the "Miserere," the "Good Friday" mass. On Easter
Sunday<a name="FNanchor_226:1_1155" id="FNanchor_226:1_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_226:1_1155" class="fnanchor">[226:1]</a> all the drapery has disappeared; the church is
<i>illuminated</i>, and rejoicing, in place of sorrow, is manifest. The
Easter hymns partake of the following expression:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Rejoice, Oh sacred Initiated, your God is risen. His death,
his pains, his sufferings, have worked our salvation.</i>"</p></div>

<p>Cedrenus (a celebrated Byzantine writer), speaking of the 25th of March,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The first day of the first month, is the first of the month
<i>Nisan</i>; it corresponds to the 25th of March of the <i>Romans</i>,
and the <i>Phamenot</i> of the <i>Egyptians</i>. On that day Gabriel
saluted Mary, in order to make her conceive the Saviour. I
observe that it is the same month, <i>Phamenot</i>, that <i>Osiris</i>
gave fecundity to <i>Isis</i>, according to the Egyptian theology.
<i>On the very same day, our God Saviour </i>(Christ Jesus)<i>, after
the termination of his career, arose from the dead</i>; that is,
what our forefathers called the <i>Pass-over</i>, or the passage of
the Lord. It is also on the <i>same day</i>, that our ancient
theologians have fixed his return, or his second
advent."<a name="FNanchor_226:2_1156" id="FNanchor_226:2_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_226:2_1156" class="fnanchor">[226:2]</a></p></div>

<p>We have seen, then, that a festival celebrating the resurrection of
their several gods was annually held among the Pagans, before the time
of Christ Jesus, and that it was almost universal. That it dates to a
period of great antiquity is very certain. The adventures of these
incarnate gods, exposed in their infancy, put to death, and rising again
from the grave to life and immortality, were acted on the <i>Deisuls</i> and
in the sacred theatres of the ancient Pagans,<a name="FNanchor_226:3_1157" id="FNanchor_226:3_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_226:3_1157" class="fnanchor">[226:3]</a> just as the
"Passion Play" is acted to-day.</p>

<p>Eusebius relates a <i>tale</i> to the effect that, at one time, the
Christians <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>were about to celebrate "the solemn vigils of Easter," when,
to their dismay, they found that <i>oil</i> was wanted. Narcissus, Bishop of
Jerusalem, who was among the number, "commanded that such as had charge
of the <i>lights</i>, speedily to bring unto him water, drawn up out of the
next well." This water Narcissus, "by the wonderful power of God,"
changed into <i>oil</i>, and the celebration was continued.<a name="FNanchor_227:1_1158" id="FNanchor_227:1_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_227:1_1158" class="fnanchor">[227:1]</a></p>

<p>This tells the whole story. Here we see the <i>oil</i>&mdash;which the Pagans had
in their ceremonies, and with which the priests anointed the lips of the
Initiates&mdash;and the <i>lights</i>, which were suddenly lighted when the god
was feigned to have risen from the dead.</p>

<p>With her usual policy, the Christian Church endeavored to give a
<i>Christian</i> significance to the rites borrowed from Paganism, and in
this case, as in many others, the conversion was particularly easy.</p>

<p>In the earliest times, the Christians did not celebrate the resurrection
of their Lord from the grave. They made the <i>Jewish Passover</i> their
chief festival, celebrating it on the same day as the Jews, the 14th of
Nisan, no matter in what part of the week that day might fall.
Believing, according to the tradition, that Jesus on the eve of his
death had eaten the Passover with his disciples, they regarded such a
solemnity as a commemoration of the Supper and not as a memorial of the
Resurrection. But in proportion as Christianity more and more separated
itself from Judaism and imbibed paganism, this way of looking at the
matter became less easy. A new tradition gained currency among the Roman
Christians to the effect that Jesus before his death had not eaten the
Passover, but had died on the very day of the Passover, thus
substituting himself for the Paschal Lamb. The great Christian festival
was then made the Resurrection of Jesus, and was celebrated on the first
pagan holiday&mdash;<i>Sun-day</i>&mdash;after the Passover.</p>

<p>This <i>Easter</i> celebration was observed in <i>China</i>, and called a
"Festival of Gratitude to Tien." From there it extended over the then
known world to the extreme West.</p>

<p>The ancient Pagan inhabitants of Europe celebrated annually this same
feast, which is yet continued over all the Christian world. This
festival began with a week's indulgence in all kinds of sports, called
the <i>carne-vale</i>, or the taking <i>a farewell to animal</i> food, because it
was followed by a fast of forty days. This was in honor of the Saxon
goddess <i>Ostrt</i> or <i>Eostre</i> of the Germans, whence our <i>Easter</i>.<a name="FNanchor_227:2_1159" id="FNanchor_227:2_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_227:2_1159" class="fnanchor">[227:2]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p><p>The most characteristic Easter rite, and the one most widely diffused,
is the use of <i>Easter eggs</i>. They are usually stained of various colors
with dye-woods or herbs, and people mutually make presents of them;
sometimes they are kept as <i>amulets</i>, sometimes eaten. Now, "dyed eggs
were sacred Easter offerings in <i>Egypt</i>;"<a name="FNanchor_228:1_1160" id="FNanchor_228:1_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_228:1_1160" class="fnanchor">[228:1]</a> the ancient <i>Persians</i>,
"when they kept the festival of the solar new year (in March), mutually
presented each other with colored eggs;"<a name="FNanchor_228:2_1161" id="FNanchor_228:2_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_228:2_1161" class="fnanchor">[228:2]</a> "the <i>Jews</i> used eggs in
the feast of the Passover;" and the custom prevailed in Western
countries.<a name="FNanchor_228:3_1162" id="FNanchor_228:3_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_228:3_1162" class="fnanchor">[228:3]</a></p>

<p>The stories of the resurrection written by the Gospel narrators are
altogether different. This is owing to the fact that the story, as
related by one, was written to correct the mistakes and to endeavor to
reconcile with common sense the absurdities of the other. For instance,
the "<i>Matthew</i>" narrator says: "And when they saw him (after he had
risen from the dead) they worshiped him; <i>but some doubted</i>."<a name="FNanchor_228:4_1163" id="FNanchor_228:4_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_228:4_1163" class="fnanchor">[228:4]</a></p>

<p>To leave the question where this writer leaves it would be fatal. In
such a case there must be no doubt. Therefore, the "<i>Mark</i>" narrator
makes Jesus appear <i>three times</i>, under such circumstances as to render
a mistake next to impossible, and to silence the most obstinate
skepticism. He is first made to appear to Mary Magdalene, who was
convinced that it was Jesus, because she went and told the disciples
that he had risen, and that she had seen him. They&mdash;<i>notwithstanding
that Jesus had foretold them of his resurrection</i><a name="FNanchor_228:5_1164" id="FNanchor_228:5_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_228:5_1164" class="fnanchor">[228:5]</a>&mdash;disbelieved,
nor could they be convinced until he appeared to <i>them</i>. They in turn
told it to the other disciples, who were also skeptical; and, that they
might be convinced, Jesus also appeared to <i>them</i> as they sat at meat,
when he upbraided them for their unbelief.</p>

<p>This story is much improved in the hands of the "<i>Mark</i>" narrator, but,
in the anxiety to make a clear case, it is overdone, as often happens
when the object is to remedy or correct an oversight or mistake
previously made. In relating that the disciples <i>doubted</i> the words of
Mary Magdalene, he had probably forgotten Jesus had promised them that
he should rise, for, if he had told them this, <i>why did they doubt</i>?</p>

<p>Neither the "<i>Matthew</i>" nor the "<i>Mark</i>" narrator says in what <i>way</i>
Jesus made his appearance&mdash;whether it was in the <i>body</i> or only in the
<i>spirit</i>. If in the latter, it would be fatal to the whole theory <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>of
the resurrection, as it is a <i>material</i> resurrection that Christianity
taught&mdash;just like their neighbors the Persians&mdash;and not a
spiritual.<a name="FNanchor_229:1_1165" id="FNanchor_229:1_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_229:1_1165" class="fnanchor">[229:1]</a></p>

<p>To put this disputed question in its true light, and to silence the
objections which must naturally have arisen against it, was the object
which the "<i>Luke</i>" narrator had in view. He says that when Jesus
appeared and spoke to the disciples they were afraid: "But they were
terrified and affrighted, and <i>supposed</i> they had seen a
<i>spirit</i>."<a name="FNanchor_229:2_1166" id="FNanchor_229:2_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_229:2_1166" class="fnanchor">[229:2]</a> Jesus then&mdash;to show that he was <i>not</i> a spirit&mdash;showed
the wounds in his hands and feet. "And they gave him a piece of a
broiled fish, and of a honeycomb. And he took it, <i>and did eat before
them</i>."<a name="FNanchor_229:3_1167" id="FNanchor_229:3_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_229:3_1167" class="fnanchor">[229:3]</a> After this, who is there that can doubt? but, if the
<i>fish</i> and <i>honeycomb</i> story was true, why did the "<i>Matthew</i>" and
"<i>Mark</i>" narrators fail to mention it?</p>

<p>The "<i>Luke</i>" narrator, like his predecessors, had also overdone the
matter, and instead of convincing the skeptical, he only excited their
ridicule.</p>

<p>The "<i>John</i>" narrator now comes, and endeavors to set matters right. He
does not omit entirely the story of Jesus eating fish, <i>for that would
not do, after there had been so much said about it</i>. He might leave it
to be inferred that the "<i>Luke</i>" narrator made a mistake, so he modifies
the story and omits the ridiculous part. The scene is laid on the shores
of the Sea of Tiberias. Under the direction of Jesus, Peter drew his net
to land, full of fish. "Jesus said unto them: Come and dine. And none of
the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
Jesus then cometh, and taketh <i>bread</i>, and <i>giveth them</i>, and <i>fish</i>
likewise."<a name="FNanchor_229:4_1168" id="FNanchor_229:4_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_229:4_1168" class="fnanchor">[229:4]</a></p>

<p>It does not appear from <i>this</i> account that Jesus ate the fish at all.
He took the fish and <i>gave to the disciples</i>; the inference is that
<i>they</i> were the ones that ate. In the "<i>Luke</i>" narrator's account <i>the
statement is reversed</i>; the disciples gave the fish to Jesus, <i>and he
ate</i>. The "<i>John</i>" narrator has taken out of the story that which was
absurd, but he leaves us to infer that the "<i>Luke</i>" narrator was
<i>careless</i> in stating the account of what took place. If we leave out of
the "<i>Luke</i>" narrator's account the part that relates to the fish and
honeycomb, he fails to prove what it really <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>was which appeared to the
disciples, as it seems from this that the disciples could not be
convinced that Jesus was not a spirit until he had actually eaten
something.</p>

<p>Now, if the <i>eating</i> part is struck out&mdash;which the "<i>John</i>" narrator
does, and which, no doubt, the ridicule cast upon it drove him to
do&mdash;the "<i>Luke</i>" narrator leaves the question <i>just where he found it</i>.
It was the business of the "<i>John</i>" narrator to attempt to leave it
clean, and put an end to all cavil.</p>

<p>Jesus appeared to the disciples when they assembled at Jerusalem. "And
when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side."<a name="FNanchor_230:1_1169" id="FNanchor_230:1_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_230:1_1169" class="fnanchor">[230:1]</a>
They were satisfied, and no doubts were expressed. But Thomas was not
present, and when he was told by the brethren that Jesus had appeared to
them, he refused to believe; nor would he, "Except I shall see in his
hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the
nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe."<a name="FNanchor_230:2_1170" id="FNanchor_230:2_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_230:2_1170" class="fnanchor">[230:2]</a>
Now, if Thomas could be convinced, with all <i>his</i> doubts, it would be
foolish after <i>that</i> to deny that Jesus was not in the <i>body</i> when he
appeared to his disciples.</p>

<p>After eight days Jesus again appears, for no other purpose&mdash;as it would
seem&mdash;but to convince the doubting disciple Thomas. Then said he to
Thomas: "Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither
thy hand, and thrust it into my side; and be not faithless, but
believing."<a name="FNanchor_230:3_1171" id="FNanchor_230:3_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_230:3_1171" class="fnanchor">[230:3]</a> This convinced Thomas, and he exclaimed: "My Lord and
my God." After <i>this evidence</i>, if there were still unbelievers, they
were even more skeptical than Thomas himself. We should be at a loss to
understand <i>why the writers of the first three Gospels entirely omitted
the story of Thomas</i>, if we were not aware that when the "<i>John</i>"
narrator wrote the state of the public mind was such that proof of the
most unquestionable character was demanded that Christ Jesus had risen
in the body. The "<i>John</i>" narrator selected a person who claimed he was
hard to convince, and if the evidence was such as to satisfy <i>him</i>, it
ought to satisfy the balance of the world.<a name="FNanchor_230:4_1172" id="FNanchor_230:4_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_230:4_1172" class="fnanchor">[230:4]</a></p>

<p>The first that we knew of the fourth Gospel&mdash;attributed to <i>John</i>&mdash;is
from the writings of <i>Iren&aelig;us</i> (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 177-202), and the evidence is that
<i>he is the author of it</i>.<a name="FNanchor_230:5_1173" id="FNanchor_230:5_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_230:5_1173" class="fnanchor">[230:5]</a> That controversies were rife in his day
concerning the resurrection of Jesus, is very evident from other
sources. We find that at this time the resurrection of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>the dead
(according to the accounts of the Christian forgers) was very far from
being esteemed an uncommon event; that the miracle was frequently
performed on necessary occasions by great fasting and the joint
supplication of the church of the place, and that the persons thus
restored by their prayers had lived afterwards among them many years. At
such a period, when faith could boast of so many wonderful victories
over death, it seems difficult to account for the skepticism of those
philosophers, who still rejected and derided the doctrine of the
resurrection. A noble Grecian had rested on this important ground the
whole controversy, and promised Theophilus, bishop of Antioch, <i>that if
he could be gratified by the sight of a single person who had been
actually raised from the dead, he would immediately embrace the
Christian religion</i>.</p>

<p>"It is somewhat remarkable," says Gibbon, the historian, from whom we
take the above, "that the prelate of the first Eastern Church, however
anxious for the conversion of his friend, thought proper to <i>decline</i>
this fair and reasonable challenge."<a name="FNanchor_231:1_1174" id="FNanchor_231:1_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_231:1_1174" class="fnanchor">[231:1]</a></p>

<p>This Christian <i>saint</i>, Iren&aelig;us, had invented many stories of others
being raised from the dead, for the purpose of attempting to strengthen
the belief in the resurrection of Jesus. In the words of the Rev.
Jeremiah Jones:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Such <i>pious frauds</i> were very common among Christians even in
the first three centuries; and a forgery of this nature, with
the view above-mentioned, <i>seems natural and probable</i>."</p></div>

<p>One of these "<i>pious frauds</i>" is the "<i>Gospel of Nicodemus the Disciple,
concerning the Sufferings and Resurrection of our Master and Saviour
Jesus Christ</i>." Although attributed to Nicodemus, a disciple of Jesus,
it has been shown to be a forgery, written towards the close of the
second century&mdash;during the time of <i>Iren&aelig;us</i>, the well-known pious
forger. In this book we find the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And now hear me a little. We all know the blessed Simeon, the
high-priest, who took Jesus when an infant into his arms in
the temple. This same Simeon had two sons of his own, <i>and we
were all present at their death and funeral</i>. Go therefore and
see their <i>tombs</i>, for these are open, <i>and they are risen</i>;
and behold, they are in the city of Arimath&aelig;a, spending their
time together in offices of devotion."<a name="FNanchor_231:2_1175" id="FNanchor_231:2_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_231:2_1175" class="fnanchor">[231:2]</a></p></div>

<p>The purpose of this story is very evident. Some "zealous believer,"
observing the appeals for proof of the resurrection, wishing to make it
appear that resurrections from the dead were <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>common occurrences,
invented this story <i>towards the close of the second century</i>, and
fathered it upon Nicodemus.</p>

<p>We shall speak, anon, more fully on the subject of the frauds of the
early Christians, the "lying and deceiving <i>for the cause of Christ</i>,"
which is carried on even to the present day.</p>

<p>As President Cheney of Bates College has lately remarked, "<i>The
resurrection is the doctrine of Christianity and the foundation of the
entire system</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_232:1_1176" id="FNanchor_232:1_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_232:1_1176" class="fnanchor">[232:1]</a> but outside of the four spurious gospels this
greatest of all recorded miracles is hardly mentioned. "We have epistles
from Peter, James, John, and Jude&mdash;all of whom are said by the
evangelists to have <i>seen</i> Jesus after he rose from the dead, in none of
which epistles is the fact of the resurrection even stated, much less
that Jesus was seen by the writer after his resurrection."<a name="FNanchor_232:2_1177" id="FNanchor_232:2_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_232:2_1177" class="fnanchor">[232:2]</a></p>

<p>Many of the early Christian sects denied the resurrection of Christ
Jesus, but taught that he will rise, when there shall be a general
resurrection.</p>

<p>No actual representation of the resurrection of the Christian's Saviour
has yet been found among the monuments of <i>early</i> Christianity. The
earliest representation of this event that has been found is an ivory
carving, and belongs to the <i>fifth or sixth</i> century.<a name="FNanchor_232:3_1178" id="FNanchor_232:3_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_232:3_1178" class="fnanchor">[232:3]</a></p>

solemnized on the 25th of March, the very day upon which the Pagan gods
were believed to have risen from the dead. (See Dupuis: Origin of
Religious Belief, pp. 244, 255.)</p>

<p>A very long and terrible schism took place in the Christian Church upon
the question whether <i>Easter</i>, the day of the resurrection, was to be
celebrated on the 14th day of the first month, after the Jewish custom,
or on the Lord's day afterward; and it was at last decided in favor of
the Lord's day. (See Higgins: Anacalypsis, vol. ii. p. 90, and
Chambers's Encyclop&aelig;dia, art. "Easter.")</p>

<p>The day upon which Easter should be celebrated was not settled until the
Council of Nice. (See Euseb. Life of Constantine, lib. 3, ch. xvii.
Also, Socrates' Eccl. Hist. lib. 1, ch. vi.)</p></div>

goddess, <i>Ostrt</i>, of the Saxons, and the <i>Eostre</i> of the Germans.</p>

<p>"Many of the popular observances connected with Easter are clearly of
<i>Pagan origin</i>. The goddess Ostara or Eastre seems to have been the
personification of the morning or East, and also of the opening year or
Spring.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. With her usual policy, the church endeavored to give a
Christian significance to such of the rites as could not be rooted out;
and in this case the conversion was practically easy." (Chambers's
Encyclo., art. "Easter.")</p></div>

<h3>THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST JESUS, AND THE MILLENNIUM.</h3>

<p>The second coming of Christ Jesus is clearly taught in the canonical, as
well as in the apocryphal, books of the New Testament. Paul teaches, or
<i>is made to teach it</i>,<a name="FNanchor_233:1_1179" id="FNanchor_233:1_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_233:1_1179" class="fnanchor">[233:1]</a> in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we
say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive
<i>and remain unto the coming of the Lord</i>, shall not prevent
them which are asleep. <i>For the Lord himself shall descend
from heaven</i> with a shout, with the voice of the archangel,
and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise
first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be <i>caught up</i>
together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord <i>in the
air</i>: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_233:2_1180" id="FNanchor_233:2_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_233:2_1180" class="fnanchor">[233:2]</a></p></div>

<p>He further tells the Thessalonians to "abstain from all appearance of
evil," and to "be preserved blameless <i>unto the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ</i>."<a name="FNanchor_233:3_1181" id="FNanchor_233:3_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_233:3_1181" class="fnanchor">[233:3]</a></p>

<p>James,<a name="FNanchor_233:4_1182" id="FNanchor_233:4_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_233:4_1182" class="fnanchor">[233:4]</a> in his epistle to the brethren, tells them not to be in
too great a hurry for the coming of their Lord, but to "be patient" and
wait for the "coming of the Lord," as the "husbandman waiteth for the
precious fruit of the earth." But still he assures them that "the coming
of the Lord draweth nigh."<a name="FNanchor_233:5_1183" id="FNanchor_233:5_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_233:5_1183" class="fnanchor">[233:5]</a></p>

<p>Peter, in his first epistle, tells his brethren that "the end of all
things is at hand,"<a name="FNanchor_233:6_1184" id="FNanchor_233:6_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_233:6_1184" class="fnanchor">[233:6]</a> and that when the "chief shepherd" does
appear, they "shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not
away."<a name="FNanchor_233:7_1185" id="FNanchor_233:7_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_233:7_1185" class="fnanchor">[233:7]</a></p>

<p>John, in his first epistle, tells the Christian community to "abide <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>in
him" (Christ), so that, "when he shall appear, we may have confidence,
and not be ashamed before him."<a name="FNanchor_234:1_1186" id="FNanchor_234:1_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_234:1_1186" class="fnanchor">[234:1]</a></p>

<p>He further says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Behold, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet
appear what we shall be, but we know that, <i>when he shall
appear</i>, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he
is."<a name="FNanchor_234:2_1187" id="FNanchor_234:2_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_234:2_1187" class="fnanchor">[234:2]</a></p></div>

<p>According to the writer of the book of "The Acts," when Jesus ascended
into heaven, the Apostles stood looking <i>up</i> towards heaven, where he
had gone, and while thus engaged: "behold, two men stood by them
(dressed) in white apparel," who said unto them:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This
same Jesus which is <i>taken up</i> from you into heaven, <i>shall so
come in like manner as ye have seen him go</i> (up) <i>into
heaven</i>."<a name="FNanchor_234:3_1188" id="FNanchor_234:3_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_234:3_1188" class="fnanchor">[234:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The one great object which the writer of the book of Revelations wished
to present to view, was "<i>the second coming of Christ</i>." This writer,
who seems to have been anxious for that time, which was "surely" to come
"quickly;" ends his book by saying: "Even so, come Lord Jesus."<a name="FNanchor_234:4_1189" id="FNanchor_234:4_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_234:4_1189" class="fnanchor">[234:4]</a></p>

<p>The two men, dressed in white apparel, who had told the Apostles that
Jesus should "come again," were not the only persons whom they looked to
for authority. He himself (according to the Gospel) had told them so:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Son of man shall come (again) in the glory of his Father
with his angels."</p></div>

<p>And, as if to impress upon their minds that his second coming should not
be at a distant day, he further said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Verily I say unto you, there be some standing here, which
shall not taste of death, <i>till they see the Son of man coming
in his kingdom</i>."<a name="FNanchor_234:5_1190" id="FNanchor_234:5_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_234:5_1190" class="fnanchor">[234:5]</a></p></div>

<p>This, surely, is very explicit, but it is not the only time he speaks of
his second advent. When foretelling the destruction of the temple, his
disciples came unto him, saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Tell us when shall these things be, <i>and what shall be the
sign of thy coming</i>?"<a name="FNanchor_234:6_1191" id="FNanchor_234:6_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_234:6_1191" class="fnanchor">[234:6]</a></p></div>

<p>His answer to this is very plain:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Verily I say unto you, <i>this generation shall not pass till
all these things be fulfilled</i> (<i>i. e</i>, the destruction of the
temple and his second coming), but of that day and hour
knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father
only."<a name="FNanchor_234:7_1192" id="FNanchor_234:7_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_234:7_1192" class="fnanchor">[234:7]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p><p>In the second Epistle <i>attributed</i> to Peter, which was written after
that generation had passed away,<a name="FNanchor_235:1_1193" id="FNanchor_235:1_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_235:1_1193" class="fnanchor">[235:1]</a> there had begun to be some
impatience manifest among the <i>believers</i>, on account of the long delay
of Christ Jesus' second coming. "Where is the promise of his coming?"
say they, "for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they
were from the beginning of the creation."<a name="FNanchor_235:2_1194" id="FNanchor_235:2_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_235:2_1194" class="fnanchor">[235:2]</a> In attempting to
smoothe over matters, this writer says: "There shall come in the last
days scoffers, saying: 'Where is the promise of his coming?'" to which
he replies by telling them that they were ignorant of all the ways of
the Lord, and that: "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a
thousand years as one day." He further says: "The Lord is not slack
concerning his promise;" and that "the day of the Lord <i>will come</i>."
This coming is to be "as a thief in the night," that is, when they least
expect it.<a name="FNanchor_235:3_1195" id="FNanchor_235:3_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_235:3_1195" class="fnanchor">[235:3]</a></p>

<p>No wonder there should have been scoffers&mdash;as this writer calls
them&mdash;the generation which was not to have passed away before his
coming, had passed away; all those who stood there had been dead many
years; the sun had not yet been darkened; the stars were still in the
heavens, and the moon still continued to reflect light. None of the
predictions had yet been fulfilled.</p>

<p>Some of the early Christian Fathers have tried to account for the words
of Jesus, where he says: "Verily I say unto you, there be some standing
here which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming
in his kingdom," by saying that he referred to <i>John</i> only, and that
that Apostle was not dead, but sleeping. This fictitious story is
related by Saint Augustin, "from the report," as he says, "of credible
persons," and is to the effect that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"At Ephesus, where St. John the Apostle lay buried, he was not
believed to be dead, <i>but to be sleeping only in the grave</i>,
which he had provided for himself till our Saviour's second
coming: in proof of which, they affirm, that the earth, under
which he lay, was seen to heave up and down perpetually, in
conformity to the motion of his body, in the act of
breathing."<a name="FNanchor_235:4_1196" id="FNanchor_235:4_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_235:4_1196" class="fnanchor">[235:4]</a></p></div>

<p>This story clearly illustrates the stupid credulity and superstition of
the primitive age of the church, and the faculty of imposing any
fictions upon the people, which their leaders saw fit to inculcate.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the <i>millennium</i> designates a certain period in the
history of the world, lasting for a long, indefinite space (vaguely a
<i>thousand years</i>, as the word "<i>millennium</i>" implies) during which the
kingdom of <i>Christ Jesus</i> will be visibly established on the earth. The
idea undoubtedly originated proximately in the Messianic <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>expectation of
the Jews (as Jesus <i>did not</i> sit on the throne of David and become an
earthly ruler, it <i>must be</i> that he is <i>coming again</i> for this purpose),
but more remotely in the Pagan doctrine of the final triumph of the
several "Christs" over their adversaries.</p>

<p>In the first century of the Church, <i>millenarianism</i> was a <i>whispered</i>
belief, to which the book of Daniel, and more particularly the
predictions of the <i>Apocalypse</i><a name="FNanchor_236:1_1197" id="FNanchor_236:1_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_236:1_1197" class="fnanchor">[236:1]</a> gave an apostolical authority,
but, when the church imbibed <i>Paganism</i>, their belief on this subject
lent it a more vivid coloring and imagery.</p>

<p>The unanimity which the early Christian teachers exhibit in regard to
<i>millenarianism</i>, proves how strongly it had laid hold of the
imagination of the Church, to which, in this early stage, immortality
and future rewards were to a great extent things of this world as yet.
Not only did Cerinthus, but even the orthodox doctors&mdash;such as Papias
(Bishop of Hierapolis), Iren&aelig;us, Justin Martyr and others&mdash;delighted
themselves with dreams of the glory and magnificence of the millennial
kingdom. Papias, in his collection of traditional sayings of Christ
Jesus, indulges in the most monstrous representations of the re-building
of Jerusalem, and the colossal vines and grapes of the millennial reign.</p>

<p>According to the general opinion, the millennium was to be preceded by
great calamities, after which the Messiah, <i>Christ Jesus</i>, would appear,
and would bind Satan for a thousand years, annihilate the godless
heathen, or make them slaves of the believers, overturn the Roman
empire, from the ruins of which a new order of things would spring
forth, in which "the dead in Christ" would rise, and along with the
surviving saints enjoy an incomparable felicity in the city of the "New
Jerusalem." Finally, all nations would bend their knee to <i>him</i>, and
acknowledge <i>him only</i> to be <i>the Christ</i>&mdash;his religion would reign
supreme. This is the "Golden Age" of the future, which all nations of
antiquity believed in and looked forward to.</p>

<p>We will first turn to <i>India</i>, and shall there find that the <i>Hindoos</i>
believed their "<i>Saviour</i>," or "Preserver" <i>Vishnu</i>, who appeared in
mortal form as <i>Crishna</i>, is <i>to come again in the latter days</i>. Their
sacred books declare that in the last days, when the fixed stars have
all apparently returned to the point whence they started, at the
beginning of all things, in the month <i>Scorpio</i>, Vishnu will appear
among mortals, in the form of an armed warrior, riding a winged <i>white
horse</i>.<a name="FNanchor_236:2_1198" id="FNanchor_236:2_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_236:2_1198" class="fnanchor">[236:2]</a> In one hand he will carry a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>scimitar, "blazing like a
comet," to destroy all the impure who shall then dwell on the face of
the earth. In the other hand he will carry a large shining ring, to
signify that the great circle of <i>Yugas</i> (ages) is completed, and that
the end has come. At his approach <i>the sun and moon will be darkened,
the earth will tremble, and the stars fall from the firmament</i>.<a name="FNanchor_237:1_1199" id="FNanchor_237:1_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_237:1_1199" class="fnanchor">[237:1]</a></p>

<p>The Buddhists believe that <i>Buddha</i> has repeatedly assumed a human form
to facilitate the reunion of men with his own universal soul, so they
believe that <i>"in the latter days" he will come again</i>. Their sacred
books predict this coming, and relate that his mission will be to
restore the world to order and happiness.<a name="FNanchor_237:2_1200" id="FNanchor_237:2_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_237:2_1200" class="fnanchor">[237:2]</a> This is exactly the
Christian idea of the millennium.</p>

<p>The <i>Chinese</i> also believe that "<i>in the latter days</i>" there is to be a
<i>millennium</i> upon earth. Their five sacred volumes are full of
prophesies concerning this "Golden Age of the Future." It is the
universal belief among them that a "<i>Divine Man</i>" will establish himself
on earth, and everywhere restore peace and happiness.<a name="FNanchor_237:3_1201" id="FNanchor_237:3_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_237:3_1201" class="fnanchor">[237:3]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Persians</i> believed that in the last days, there would be a
millennium on earth, when the religion of Zoroaster would be accepted by
all mankind. The Parsees of to-day, who are the remnants of the once
mighty Persians, have a tradition that a holy personage is waiting in a
region called Kanguedez, for a summons from the Ized Serosch, who in the
last days will bring him to Persia, to restore the ancient dominion of
that country, and spread the religion of Zoroaster over the whole
earth.<a name="FNanchor_237:4_1202" id="FNanchor_237:4_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_237:4_1202" class="fnanchor">[237:4]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Joseph B. Gross, in his "Heathen Religion,"<a name="FNanchor_237:5_1203" id="FNanchor_237:5_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_237:5_1203" class="fnanchor">[237:5]</a> speaking of
the belief of the ancient Persians in the millennium, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The dead would be raised,<a name="FNanchor_237:6_1204" id="FNanchor_237:6_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_237:6_1204" class="fnanchor">[237:6]</a> and he who has made all
things, cause the earth and the sea to return again the
remains of the departed.<a name="FNanchor_237:7_1205" id="FNanchor_237:7_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_237:7_1205" class="fnanchor">[237:7]</a> Then Ormuzd shall clothe them
with flesh and blood, while they that live at the time of the
resurrection, must die in order to likewise participate in its
advantage.</p>

<p>"Before this momentous event takes place, three illustrious
prophets shall appear, who will announce their presence by the
performance of miracles.</p>

<p>"During this period of its existence, and till its final
removal, the earth will be afflicted with pestilence,
tempests, war, famine, and various other baneful
calamities."<a name="FNanchor_237:8_1206" id="FNanchor_237:8_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_237:8_1206" class="fnanchor">[237:8]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>"After the resurrection, every one will be apprised of the
good or evil which he may have done, and the righteous and the
wicked will be separated from each other.<a name="FNanchor_238:1_1207" id="FNanchor_238:1_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_238:1_1207" class="fnanchor">[238:1]</a> Those of the

After this, they enjoy endless felicity in the society of the

<p>The disciples of <i>Bacchus</i> expected his <i>second advent</i>. They hoped he
would assume at some future day the government of the universe, and that
he would restore to man his primary felicity.<a name="FNanchor_238:9_1215" id="FNanchor_238:9_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_238:9_1215" class="fnanchor">[238:9]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Esthonian</i> from the time of the German invasion lived a life of
bondage under a foreign yoke, and the iron of his slavery entered into
his soul. He told how the ancient hero Kalewipoeg sits in the realms of
shadows, waiting until his country is in its extremity of distress, when
he will <i>return to earth</i> to avenge the injuries of the Esths, and
elevate the poor crushed people into a mighty power.<a name="FNanchor_238:10_1216" id="FNanchor_238:10_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_238:10_1216" class="fnanchor">[238:10]</a></p>

<p>The suffering <i>Celt</i> has his Brian Boroihme, or Arthur, <i>who will come
again</i>, the first to inaugurate a Fenian millennium, the second to
regenerate Wales. Olger Dansk waits till the time arrives when he is to
start from sleep to the assistance of the <i>Dane</i> against the hated
Prussian. The Messiah is to come and restore the kingdom <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>of the <i>Jews</i>.
Charlemagne was the Messiah of medi&aelig;val Teutondom. He it was who founded
the great German empire, and shed over it the blaze of Christian truth,
and now he sleeps in the Kyffhauserberg, waiting till German heresy has
reached its climax and Germany is wasted through internal conflicts, to
rush to earth once more, and revive the great empire and restore the
Catholic faith.<a name="FNanchor_239:1_1217" id="FNanchor_239:1_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_239:1_1217" class="fnanchor">[239:1]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Scandinavians</i> believed that in the "latter days" great
calamities would befall mankind. The earth would tremble, and the stars
fall from heaven. After which, the great <i>serpent</i> would be chained, and
the religion of Odin would reign supreme.<a name="FNanchor_239:2_1218" id="FNanchor_239:2_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_239:2_1218" class="fnanchor">[239:2]</a></p>

<p>The disciples of <i>Quetzalcoatle</i>, the Mexican Saviour, expected his
second advent. Before he departed this life, he told the inhabitants of
Cholula that he would return again to govern them.<a name="FNanchor_239:3_1219" id="FNanchor_239:3_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_239:3_1219" class="fnanchor">[239:3]</a> This
remarkable tradition was so deeply cherished in their hearts, says Mr.
Prescott in his "Conquest of Mexico," that "the Mexicans looked
confidently to the return of their benevolent deity."<a name="FNanchor_239:4_1220" id="FNanchor_239:4_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_239:4_1220" class="fnanchor">[239:4]</a></p>

<p>So implicitly was this believed by the subjects, that when the Spaniards
appeared on the coast, they were joyfully hailed as the returning god
and his companions. Montezuma's messengers reported to the Inca that "it
was Quetzalcoatle who was coming, bringing his temples (ships) with
him." All throughout New Spain they expected the reappearance of this
"Son of the Great God" into the world, who would renew all
things.<a name="FNanchor_239:5_1221" id="FNanchor_239:5_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_239:5_1221" class="fnanchor">[239:5]</a></p>

<p>Acosta alludes to this, in his "History of the Indies," as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the beginning of the year 1518, they (the Mexicans),
discovered a fleet at sea, in the which was the Marques del
Valle, Don Fernando Cortez, with his companions, a news which
much troubled Montezuma, and conferring with his council, they
all said, that without doubt, their great and ancient lord
Quetzalcoatle was come, who had said that he would return from
the East, whither he had gone."<a name="FNanchor_239:6_1222" id="FNanchor_239:6_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_239:6_1222" class="fnanchor">[239:6]</a></p></div>

<p>The doctrine of the millennium and the second advent of Christ Jesus,
has been a very important one in the Christian church. The ancient
Christians were animated by a contempt for their present existence, and
by a just confidence of immortality, of which the doubtful and imperfect
faith of modern ages cannot give us any adequate notion. In the
primitive church, the influence of truth was powerfully strengthened by
an opinion, which, however much it may deserve respect for its
usefulness and antiquity, has not been <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>found agreeable to experience.
<i>It was universally believed, that the end of the world and the kingdom
of heaven were at hand.</i><a name="FNanchor_240:1_1223" id="FNanchor_240:1_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_240:1_1223" class="fnanchor">[240:1]</a> The near approach of this wonderful
event had been predicted, as we have seen, by the Apostles; the
tradition of it was preserved by their earliest disciples, and those who
believed that the discourses <i>attributed</i> to Jesus were really uttered
by him, were <i>obliged</i> to expect the second and glorious coming of the
"Son of Man" in the clouds, <i>before that generation was totally
extinguished</i> which had beheld his humble condition upon earth, and
which might still witness the calamities of the Jews under Vespasian or
Hadrian. The revolution of seventeen centuries has instructed us not to
press too closely the <i>mysterious</i> language of prophecy and revelation;
but as long as this error was permitted to subsist in the church, it was
productive of the most salutary effects on the faith and practice of
Christians, who lived in the awful expectation of that moment when the
globe itself and all the various races of mankind, <i>should tremble at
the appearance of their divine judge</i>. This expectation was
countenanced&mdash;as we have seen&mdash;by the twenty-fourth chapter of St.
Matthew, and by the first epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians. Erasmus
(one of the most vigorous promoters of the Reformation) removes the
difficulty by the help of <i>allegory</i> and <i>metaphor</i>; and the learned
Grotius (a learned theologian of the 16th century) ventures to
insinuate, that, for wise purposes, <i>the pious deception was permitted
to take place</i>.</p>

<p><i>The ancient and popular doctrine of the millennium</i> was intimately
connected with the second coming of Christ Jesus. As the works of the
creation had been fixed in <i>six days</i>, their duration in the present
state, according to a tradition which was attributed to the prophet
Elijah, was fixed to <i>six thousand years</i>.<a name="FNanchor_240:2_1224" id="FNanchor_240:2_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_240:2_1224" class="fnanchor">[240:2]</a> By the same analogy it
was inferred, that this long period of labor and contention, which had
now almost elapsed, would be succeeded by a joyful Sabbath of a
<i>thousand years</i>, and that Christ Jesus, with the triumphant band of the
saints and the elect who had escaped death, or who had been miraculously
revived, would reign upon earth until the time appointed for the last
and general resurrection. So pleasing was this hope to the mind of the
believers, that the "New Jerusalem," the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>seat of this blissful kingdom,
was quickly adorned with all the gayest colors of the imagination. A
felicity consisting only of pure and spiritual pleasure would have been
too refined for its inhabitants, who were still supposed to possess
their human nature and senses. A "Garden of Eden," with the amusements
of the pastoral life, was no longer suited to the advanced state of
society which prevailed under the Roman empire. A city was therefore
erected of gold and precious stones, and a supernatural plenty of corn
and wine was bestowed on the adjacent territory; in the free enjoyment
of whose spontaneous productions, the happy and benevolent people were
never to be restrained by any jealous laws of exclusive property. Most
of these pictures were borrowed from a misrepresentation of Isaiah,
Daniel, and the Apocalypse. One of the grossest images may be found in
Iren&aelig;us (l. v.) the disciple of Papias, who had seen the Apostle St.
John. Though it might not be universally received, it appears to have
been the reigning sentiment of the orthodox believers; and it seems so
well adapted to the desires and apprehensions of mankind, that it must
have contributed in a very considerable degree to the progress of the
Christian faith. But when the edifice of the church was almost
completed, the temporary support was laid aside. The doctrine of Christ
Jesus' reign upon earth was at first treated as a profound <i>allegory</i>,
was considered by degrees as a <i>doubtful</i> and <i>useless</i> opinion, and was
at length rejected as the absurd invention of heresy and fanaticism. But
although this doctrine had been "laid aside," and "rejected," it was
again resurrected, and is alive and rife at the present day, even among
those who stand as the leaders of the orthodox faith.</p>

<p>The expectation of the "last day" in the year 1000 <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span>, reinvested the
doctrine with a transitory importance; but it lost all credit again when
the hopes so keenly excited by the <i>crusades</i> faded away before the
stern reality of Saracenic success, and the predictions of the
"Everlasting Gospel," a work of Joachim de Floris, a Franciscan abbot,
remained unfulfilled.<a name="FNanchor_241:1_1225" id="FNanchor_241:1_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_241:1_1225" class="fnanchor">[241:1]</a></p>

<p>At the period of the <i>Reformation</i>, millenarianism once more experienced
a partial revival, because it was not a difficult matter <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>to apply some
of its symbolism to the papacy. The Pope, for example, was
<i>Antichrist</i>&mdash;a belief still adhered to by some extreme Protestants. Yet
the doctrine was not adopted by the great body of the reformers, but by
some fanatical sects, such as the Anabaptists, and by the Theosophists
of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>During the civil and religious wars in France and England, when great
excitement prevailed, it was also prominent. The "Fifth Monarchy Men" of
Cromwell's time were millenarians of the most exaggerated and dangerous
sort. Their peculiar tenet was that the millennium <i>had</i> come, and that
<i>they</i> were the saints who were to inherit the earth. The excesses of
the French Roman Catholic Mystics and Quietists terminated in
<i>chiliastic</i><a name="FNanchor_242:1_1226" id="FNanchor_242:1_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_242:1_1226" class="fnanchor">[242:1]</a> views. Among the Protestants it was during the
"Thirty Years' War" that the most enthusiastic and learned chiliasts
flourished. The awful suffering and wide-spread desolation of that time
led pious hearts to solace themselves with the hope of a peaceful and
glorious future. Since then the <i>penchant</i> which has sprung up for
expounding the prophetical books of the Bible, and particularly the
<i>Apocalypse</i>, with a view to present events, has given the doctrine a
faint semi-theological life, very different, however, from the earnest
faith of the first Christians.</p>

<p>Among the foremost chiliastic teachers of modern centuries are to be
mentioned Ezechiel Meth, Paul Felgenhauer, Bishop Comenius, Professor
Jurien, Seraris, Poiret, J. Mede; while Thomas Burnet and William
Whiston endeavored to give chiliasm a geological foundation, but without
finding much favor. Latterly, especially since the rise and extension of
missionary enterprise, the opinion has obtained a wide currency, that
after the conversion of the whole world to Christianity, a blissful and
glorious era will ensue; but not much stress&mdash;except by extreme
literalists&mdash;is now laid on the nature or duration of this far-off
felicity.</p>

<p>Great eagerness, and not a little ingenuity have been exhibited by many
persons in fixing a <i>date</i> for the commencement of the millennium. The
celebrated theologian, Johann Albrecht Bengel, who, in the eighteenth
century, revived an earnest interest in the subject amongst orthodox
Protestants, asserted from a study of the prophecies that the millennium
would begin in 1836. This date was long popular. Swedenborg held that
the last judgment <i>took place</i> in 1757, and that the new church, or
"<i>Church of the New Jerusalem</i>," as his followers designate
themselves&mdash;in other words, the millennial era&mdash;<i>then began</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p><p>In America, considerable agitation was excited by the preaching of one
William Miller, who fixed the second advent of Christ Jesus about 1843.
Of late years, the most noted English millenarian was Dr. John Cumming,
who placed the end of the <i>present dispensation</i> in 1866 or 1867; but as
that time passed without any millennial symptoms, he modified his
original views considerably, before he died, and conjectured that the
beginning of the millennium would not differ so much after all from the
years immediately preceding it, as people commonly suppose.</p>

<h3>CHRIST JESUS AS JUDGE OF THE DEAD.</h3>

<p>According to Christian dogma, "God the Father" is not to be the judge at
the last day, but this very important office is to be held by "God the
Son." This is taught by the writer of "The Gospel according to St.
John"&mdash;whoever he may have been&mdash;when he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"For the Father judgeth no man, <i>but hath committed all
judgment unto the Son</i>."<a name="FNanchor_244:1_1227" id="FNanchor_244:1_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_244:1_1227" class="fnanchor">[244:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Paul also, in his "Epistle to the Romans" (or some other person who has
interpolated the passage), tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men," this
judgment shall be done "by <i>Jesus Christ</i>," his son.<a name="FNanchor_244:2_1228" id="FNanchor_244:2_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_244:2_1228" class="fnanchor">[244:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Again, in his "Epistle to Timothy,"<a name="FNanchor_244:3_1229" id="FNanchor_244:3_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_244:3_1229" class="fnanchor">[244:3]</a> he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>The Lord Jesus Christ</i> shall judge the quick and the dead,
at his appearing and his kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_244:4_1230" id="FNanchor_244:4_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_244:4_1230" class="fnanchor">[244:4]</a></p></div>

<p>The writer of the "Gospel according to St. Matthew," also describes
Christ Jesus as judge at the last day.<a name="FNanchor_244:5_1231" id="FNanchor_244:5_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_244:5_1231" class="fnanchor">[244:5]</a></p>

<p>Now, the question arises, <i>is this doctrine original with Christianity</i>?
To this we must answer <i>no</i>. It was taught, for ages before the time of
Christ Jesus or Christianity, that the Supreme Being&mdash;whether "Brahm&aacute;,"
"Zeru&acirc;n&eacute; Aker&eacute;n&eacute;," "Jupiter," or "Yahweh,"<a name="FNanchor_244:6_1232" id="FNanchor_244:6_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_244:6_1232" class="fnanchor">[244:6]</a>&mdash;was not to be the
judge at the last day, but that their <i>sons</i> were to hold this position.</p>

<p>The sectarians of <i>Buddha</i> taught that he (who was the <i>Son of God</i>
(Brahm&aacute;) and the Holy Virgin Maya), is to be the judge of the
dead.<a name="FNanchor_244:7_1233" id="FNanchor_244:7_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_244:7_1233" class="fnanchor">[244:7]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p><p>According to the religion of the Hindoos, <i>Crishna</i> (who was the <i>Son
of God</i>, and the Holy Virgin Devaki), is to be the judge at the last
day.<a name="FNanchor_245:1_1234" id="FNanchor_245:1_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_245:1_1234" class="fnanchor">[245:1]</a> And <i>Yama</i> is the god of the departed spirits, and the judge

<p><i>Osiris</i>, the Egyptian "Saviour" and son of the "Immaculate Virgin"
Neith or Nout, was believed by the ancient Egyptians to be the judge of
the dead.<a name="FNanchor_245:3_1236" id="FNanchor_245:3_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_245:3_1236" class="fnanchor">[245:3]</a> He is represented on Egyptian monuments, seated on his

<p>Among the many hieroglyphic titles which accompany his figure in these
sculptures, and in many other places on the walls of temples and tombs,
are "Lord of Life," "The Eternal Ruler," "Manifester of Good," "Revealer
of Truth," "Full of Goodness and Truth," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_245:6_1239" id="FNanchor_245:6_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_245:6_1239" class="fnanchor">[245:6]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Bonwick, speaking of the Egyptian belief in the last judgment, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A perusal of the twenty-fifth chapter of Matthew will prepare
the reader for the investigation of the Egyptian notion of the
last judgment."<a name="FNanchor_245:7_1240" id="FNanchor_245:7_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_245:7_1240" class="fnanchor">[245:7]</a></p></div>

<p>Prof. Carpenter, referring to the Egyptian Bible&mdash;which is by far the
most ancient of all holy books<a name="FNanchor_245:8_1241" id="FNanchor_245:8_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_245:8_1241" class="fnanchor">[245:8]</a>&mdash;says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the 'Book of the Dead,' there are used the very phrases we
find in the New Testament, <i>in connection with the day of
judgment</i>."<a name="FNanchor_245:9_1242" id="FNanchor_245:9_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_245:9_1242" class="fnanchor">[245:9]</a></p></div>

<p>According to the religion of the <i>Persians</i>, it is <i>Ormuzd</i>, "<i>The First
Born of the Eternal One</i>," who is judge of the dead. He had the title of
"The All-Seeing," and "The Just Judge."<a name="FNanchor_245:10_1243" id="FNanchor_245:10_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_245:10_1243" class="fnanchor">[245:10]</a></p>

<p>Zeru&acirc;n&eacute; Aker&eacute;n&eacute; is the name of him who corresponds to "God the Father"
among other nations. He was the "One Supreme essence," the "Invisible
and Incomprehensible."<a name="FNanchor_245:11_1244" id="FNanchor_245:11_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_245:11_1244" class="fnanchor">[245:11]</a></p>

<p>Among the ancient <i>Greeks</i>, it was <i>Aeacus</i>&mdash;Son of the Most High
God&mdash;who was to be judge of the dead.<a name="FNanchor_245:12_1245" id="FNanchor_245:12_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245:12_1245" class="fnanchor">[245:12]</a></p>

<p>The Christian Emperor Constantine, in his oration to the clergy,
speaking of the ancient poets of Greece, says:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"They affirm that men who are the <i>sons of the gods</i>, do

<p>Strange as it may seem, "there are no examples of Christ Jesus conceived
as judge, or the last judgment, in the <i>early</i> art of
Christianity."<a name="FNanchor_246:2_1247" id="FNanchor_246:2_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_246:2_1247" class="fnanchor">[246:2]</a></p>

<p>The author from whom we quote the above, says, "It would be difficult to
define the <i>cause</i> of this, though many may be conjectured."<a name="FNanchor_246:3_1248" id="FNanchor_246:3_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_246:3_1248" class="fnanchor">[246:3]</a></p>

<p>Would it be unreasonable to "conjecture" that the <i>early</i> Christians did
not teach this doctrine, but that it was imbibed, in after years, with
many other heathen ideas?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>CHRIST JESUS AS CREATOR, AND ALPHA AND OMEGA.</h3>

<p>Christian dogma also teaches that it was not "God the Father," but "God
the Son" who created the heavens, the earth, and all that therein is.</p>

<p>The writer of the fourth Gospel says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>All things were made by him</i>, and without him was not
anything made that was made."<a name="FNanchor_247:1_1249" id="FNanchor_247:1_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_247:1_1249" class="fnanchor">[247:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He was in the world <i>and the world was made by him</i>, and the
world knew him not."<a name="FNanchor_247:2_1250" id="FNanchor_247:2_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_247:2_1250" class="fnanchor">[247:2]</a></p></div>

<p>In the "Epistle to the Colossians," we read that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"By <i>him</i> were all things created that are in heaven and that
are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones,
or dominions, or principalities, or powers; <i>all things were
created by him</i>.<ins class="corr" title="original has single quote">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_247:3_1251" id="FNanchor_247:3_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_247:3_1251" class="fnanchor">[247:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Again, in the "Epistle to the Hebrews," we are told that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"God hath spoken unto us by <i>his son</i>, whom he hath appointed
heir of all things, <i>by whom also he made the world</i>."<a name="FNanchor_247:4_1252" id="FNanchor_247:4_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_247:4_1252" class="fnanchor">[247:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Samuel Johnson, D. O. Allen,<a name="FNanchor_247:5_1253" id="FNanchor_247:5_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_247:5_1253" class="fnanchor">[247:5]</a> and Thomas Maurice,<a name="FNanchor_247:6_1254" id="FNanchor_247:6_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_247:6_1254" class="fnanchor">[247:6]</a> tell us
that, according to the religion of the <i>Hindoos</i>, it is <i>Crishna</i>, the
Son, and the second person in the ever blessed Trinity,<a name="FNanchor_247:7_1255" id="FNanchor_247:7_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_247:7_1255" class="fnanchor">[247:7]</a> "who is
the origin and end of all the worlds; <i>all this universe, came into
being through him, the eternal maker</i>."<a name="FNanchor_247:8_1256" id="FNanchor_247:8_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_247:8_1256" class="fnanchor">[247:8]</a></p>

<p>In the holy book of the Hindoos, called the "<i>Bhagvat Geeta</i>," may be
found the following words of <i>Crishna</i>, addressed to his "beloved
disciple" Ar-jouan:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am <i>the Lord of all created beings</i>."<a name="FNanchor_247:9_1257" id="FNanchor_247:9_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_247:9_1257" class="fnanchor">[247:9]</a> "<i>Mankind was
created by me</i> of four kinds, distinct in their principles and
in their duties; <i>know me then to be the Creator of mankind</i>,
uncreated, and without decay."<a name="FNanchor_247:10_1258" id="FNanchor_247:10_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_247:10_1258" class="fnanchor">[247:10]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p><p>In Lecture VII., entitled: "Of the Principles of Nature, and the Vital
Spirit," he also says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am the creation and the dissolution of the whole universe.
There is not anything greater than I, and all things hang on
me."</p></div>

<p>Again, in Lecture IX., entitled, "Of the Chief of Secrets and Prince of
Science," Crishna says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The whole world was spread abroad by me in my invisible form.
All things are dependent on me." "I am the Father and the
Mother of this world, the Grandsire and the Preserver. I am
the Holy One worthy to be known; the mystic figure OM.<a name="FNanchor_248:1_1259" id="FNanchor_248:1_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_248:1_1259" class="fnanchor">[248:1]</a>
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am the journey of the good; the <i>Comforter</i>; the
<i>Creator</i>; the <i>Witness</i>; the <i>Resting-place</i>; the <i>Asylum</i>
and the <i>Friend</i>."<a name="FNanchor_248:2_1260" id="FNanchor_248:2_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_248:2_1260" class="fnanchor">[248:2]</a></p></div>

<p>In Lecture X., entitled, "Of the diversity of the Divine Nature," he
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>I am the Creator of all things</i>, and all things proceed from
me. Those who are endued with spiritual wisdom, believe this
and worship me; their very hearts and minds are in me; they
rejoice amongst themselves, and delight in speaking of my
name, and teaching one another my doctrine."<a name="FNanchor_248:3_1261" id="FNanchor_248:3_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_248:3_1261" class="fnanchor">[248:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Innumerable texts, similar to these, might be produced from the Hindoo
Scriptures, but these we deem sufficient to show, in the words of Samuel
Johnson quoted above, that, "According to the religion of the Hindoos,
it is Crishna who is the origin and the end of all the worlds;" and that
"all this universe came into being through him, the Eternal Maker." The
<i>Chinese</i> believed in One Supreme God, to whose honor they burnt
incense, but of whom they had no image. This "God the Father" was <i>not</i>
the Creator, according to their theology or mythology; but they had
another god, of whom they had statues or idols, called <i>Natigai</i>, who
was the god of all terrestrial things; in fact, God, <i>the Creator of
this world</i>&mdash;inferior or subordinate to the Supreme Being&mdash;from whom
they petition for fine weather, or whatever else they want&mdash;a sort of
<i>mediator</i>.<a name="FNanchor_248:4_1262" id="FNanchor_248:4_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_248:4_1262" class="fnanchor">[248:4]</a></p>

<p><i>Lanthu</i>, who was born of a "pure, spotless virgin," is believed by his
followers or disciples to be the Creator of all things;<a name="FNanchor_248:5_1263" id="FNanchor_248:5_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_248:5_1263" class="fnanchor">[248:5]</a> and
<i>Taou</i>, a deified hero, who is mentioned about 560 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, is believed by
some sects and affirmed by their books, to be "the original source and
first productive cause of all things."<a name="FNanchor_248:6_1264" id="FNanchor_248:6_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_248:6_1264" class="fnanchor">[248:6]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Chaldean</i> oracles, the doctrine of the "Only Begotten Son," I A
O, as <i>Creator</i>, is plainly taught.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p><p>According to ancient <i>Persian</i> mythology, there is one supreme essence,
invisible and incomprehensible, named "<i>Zeru&acirc;n&eacute; Aker&eacute;n&eacute;</i>" which
signifies "unlimited time," or "the eternal." From him emanated
<i>Ormuzd</i>, the "King of Light," the "First-born of the Eternal One," &amp;c.
Now, this "First-born of the Eternal One" is he by whom all things were
made, all things came into being through him; <i>he is the
Creator</i>.<a name="FNanchor_249:1_1265" id="FNanchor_249:1_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_249:1_1265" class="fnanchor">[249:1]</a></p>

<p>A large portion of the <i>Zend-Avesta</i>&mdash;the Persian Sacred Book or
Bible&mdash;is filled with prayers to Ormuzd, God's First-Born. The following
are samples:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I address my prayer to Ormuzd, <i>Creator of all</i> things; who
always has been, who is, and who will be forever; who is wise
and powerful; who made the great arch of heaven, the sun, the
moon, stars, winds, clouds, waters, earth, fire, trees,
animals and men, whom Zoroaster adored. Zoroaster, who brought
to the world knowledge of the law, who knew by natural
intelligence, and by the ear, what ought to be done, all that
has been, all that is, and all that will be; the science of
sciences, <i>the excellent word</i>, by which souls pass the
luminous and radiant bridge, separate themselves from the evil
regions, and go to light and holy dwellings, full of
fragrance. <i>O Creator</i>, I obey thy laws, I think, act, speak,
according to thy orders. I separate myself from all sin. I do
good works according to my power. I adore thee with purity of
thought, word, and action. I pray to Ormuzd, who recompenses
good works, who delivers unto the end all those who obey his
laws. Grant that I may arrive at paradise, where all is
fragrance, light, and happiness."<a name="FNanchor_249:2_1266" id="FNanchor_249:2_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_249:2_1266" class="fnanchor">[249:2]</a></p></div>

<p>According to the religion of the ancient <i>Assyrians</i>, it was <i>Narduk</i>,
the Logos, the <span class="allcapsc">WORD</span>, "the eldest son of Hea," "the Merciful One," "the
Life-giver," &amp;c., who created the heavens, the earth, and all that
therein is.<a name="FNanchor_249:3_1267" id="FNanchor_249:3_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_249:3_1267" class="fnanchor">[249:3]</a></p>

<p><i>Adonis</i>, the Lord and Saviour, was believed to be the Creator of men,

<p><i>Prometheus</i>, the Crucified Saviour, is the divine forethought, existing

<p>The writer of "The Gospel according to St. John," has made Christ Jesus
<i>co-eternal</i> with God, as well as Creator, in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the beginning was the <i>Word</i>, and the Word was with God."
"The same was in the beginning with God."<a name="FNanchor_249:6_1270" id="FNanchor_249:6_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_249:6_1270" class="fnanchor">[249:6]</a></p></div>

<p>Again, in praying to his Father, he makes Jesus say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with
the glory <i>which I had with thee before the world
was</i>."<a name="FNanchor_249:7_1271" id="FNanchor_249:7_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_249:7_1271" class="fnanchor">[249:7]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p><p>Paul is made to say:</p>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and
forever."<a name="FNanchor_250:2_1273" id="FNanchor_250:2_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_250:2_1273" class="fnanchor">[250:2]</a></p></div>

<p>St. John the Divine, in his "Revelation," has made Christ Jesus say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end"&mdash;"which is,
and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty,"<a name="FNanchor_250:3_1274" id="FNanchor_250:3_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_250:3_1274" class="fnanchor">[250:3]</a>

<p>Hindoo scripture also makes <i>Crishna</i> "the first and the last," "the
beginning and the end." We read in the "Geeta," where Crishna is
reported to have said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I myself never was not."<a name="FNanchor_250:5_1276" id="FNanchor_250:5_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_250:5_1276" class="fnanchor">[250:5]</a> "Learn that he by whom all

<p>Arjouan, his disciple, addresses him thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Thou art the Supreme Being, incorruptible, worthy to be

the never-failing and eternal guardian of religion; <i>thou art

<p>Again he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Reverence! Reverence be unto thee, before and behind!
Reverence be unto thee on all sides, O thou who art all in
all! Infinite in thy power and thy glory! Thou includest all

<p>In another Holy Book of the Hindoos, called the "Vishnu Purana," we also
read that Vishnu&mdash;in the form of Crishna&mdash;"who descended into the womb
of the (virgin) Devaki, and was born as her son" was "<i>without
beginning, middle or end</i>."<a name="FNanchor_250:13_1284" id="FNanchor_250:13_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_250:13_1284" class="fnanchor">[250:13]</a></p>

<p><i>Buddha</i> is also Alpha and Omega, without beginning or end, "The Lord,"
"the Possessor of All," "He who is Omnipotent and Everlastingly to be
Contemplated," "the Supreme Being, the Eternal One."<a name="FNanchor_250:14_1285" id="FNanchor_250:14_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_250:14_1285" class="fnanchor">[250:14]</a></p>

<p><i>Lao-kiun</i>, the Chinese virgin-born God, who came upon earth about six
hundred years before Jesus, was without beginning. It was said that he
had existed from all eternity.<a name="FNanchor_250:15_1286" id="FNanchor_250:15_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_250:15_1286" class="fnanchor">[250:15]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p><p>The legends of the Taou-tsze sect in China declare their founder to
have existed antecedent to the birth of the elements, in the Great
Absolute; that he is the "pure essence of the <i>t&euml;en</i>;" that he is the
original ancestor of the prime breath of life; that he gave form to the
heavens and the earth, and caused creations and annihilations to succeed
each other, in an endless series, during innumerable periods of the
world. He himself is made to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I was in existence prior to the manifestation of any
corporeal shape; I appeared anterior to the supreme being, or
first motion of creation."<a name="FNanchor_251:1_1287" id="FNanchor_251:1_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_251:1_1287" class="fnanchor">[251:1]</a></p></div>

<p>According to the <i>Zend Avesta</i>, Ormuzd, the first-born of the Eternal
One, is he "who is, always has been, and who will be forever."<a name="FNanchor_251:2_1288" id="FNanchor_251:2_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_251:2_1288" class="fnanchor">[251:2]</a></p>

<p><i>Zeus</i> was Alpha and Omega. An Orphic line runs thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Zeus is the beginning, Zeus is the middle, out of Zeus all

<p><i>Bacchus</i> was without beginning or end. An inscription on an ancient
medal, referring to him, reads thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is I who leads you; it is I who protects you, and who
saves you, I am Alpha and Omega."</p></div>

<p>Beneath this inscription is a serpent, with his tail in his mouth, thus
forming a <i>circle</i>, which was an emblem of <i>eternity</i> among the
ancients.<a name="FNanchor_251:4_1290" id="FNanchor_251:4_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_251:4_1290" class="fnanchor">[251:4]</a></p>

<p>Without enumerating them, we may say that the majority of the
virgin-born gods spoken of in <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">Chapter XII.</a> were like Christ
Jesus&mdash;without beginning or end&mdash;and that many of them were considered
Creators of all things. This has led M. Dridon to remark (in his Hist.
de Dieu), that in <i>early works of art</i>, Christ Jesus is made to take the
place of his Father in <i>creation</i> and in similar labors, just as in
heathen religions an inferior deity does the work under a superior one.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3>THE MIRACLES OF CHRIST JESUS AND THE PRIMITIVE CHRISTIANS.</h3>

<p>The legendary history of Jesus of Nazareth, contained in the books of
the New Testament, is full of prodigies and wonders. These alleged
prodigies, and the faith which the people seem to have put in such a
tissue of falsehoods, indicate the prevalent disposition of the people
to believe in everything, and it was among such a class that
Christianity was propagated. All leaders of religion had the reputation
of having performed miracles; the biographers of Jesus, therefore, not
wishing <i>their</i> Master to be outdone, have made him also a
wonder-worker, and a performer of miracles; without them Christianity
could not prosper. Miracles were needed in those days, on all special
occasions. "There is not a single historian of antiquity, whether Greek
or Latin, who has not recorded oracles, prodigies, prophecies, and
<i>miracles</i>, on the occasion of some memorable events, or revolutions of
states and kingdoms. Many of these are attested in the gravest manner by
the gravest writers, <i>and were firmly believed at the time by the
people</i>."<a name="FNanchor_252:1_1291" id="FNanchor_252:1_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_252:1_1291" class="fnanchor">[252:1]</a></p>

<p>Hindoo sacred books represent <i>Crishna</i>, their Saviour and Redeemer, as
in constant strife against the evil spirit. He surmounts extraordinary
dangers; strews his way with miracles; raising the dead, healing the
sick, restoring the maimed, the deaf and the blind; everywhere
supporting the weak against the strong, the oppressed against the
powerful. The people crowded his way and adored him as a <span class="smcap">God</span>, and these
miracles were the evidences of his divinity for centuries before the
time of Jesus.</p>

<p>The learned Thomas Maurice, speaking of Crishna, tells us that he passed
his innocent hours at the home of his foster-father, in rural
diversions, his divine origin not being suspected, <i>until repeated
miracles soon discovered his celestial origin</i>;<a name="FNanchor_252:2_1292" id="FNanchor_252:2_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_252:2_1292" class="fnanchor">[252:2]</a> and Sir William
Jones speaks of his <i>raising the dead</i>, and saving multitudes <i>by his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>miraculous powers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_253:1_1293" id="FNanchor_253:1_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_253:1_1293" class="fnanchor">[253:1]</a> To enumerate the miracles of Crishna would
be useless and tedious; we shall therefore mention but a few, of which
the Hindoo sacred books are teeming.</p>

<p>When Crishna was born, his life was sought by the reigning monarch,
Kansa, who had the infant Saviour and his father and mother locked in a
dungeon, guarded, and barred by seven iron doors. While in this dungeon
the father heard a secret voice distinctly utter these words: "Son of
Yadu, take up this child and carry it to Gokool, to the house of Nanda."
Vasudeva, struck with astonishment, answered: "How shall I obey this
injunction, thus vigilantly guarded and barred by seven iron doors that
prohibit all egress?" The unknown voice replied: "The doors shall open
of themselves to let thee pass, and behold, I have caused a deep slumber
to fall upon thy guards, which shall continue till thy journey be
accomplished." Vasudeva immediately felt his chains miraculously
loosened, and, taking up the child in his arms, hurried with it through
all the doors, the guards being buried in profound sleep. When he came
to the river Yumna, which he was obliged to cross to get to Gokool, the
waters immediately rose up to kiss the child's feet, and then
respectfully retired on each side to make way for its transportation, so
that Vasudeva passed dry-shod to the opposite shore.<a name="FNanchor_253:2_1294" id="FNanchor_253:2_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_253:2_1294" class="fnanchor">[253:2]</a></p>

<p>When Crishna came to man's estate, one of his first miracles was the
cure of a leper.</p>

<p>A passionate Brahman, having received a slight insult from a certain
Rajah, on going out of his doors, uttered this curse: "That he should,
from head to foot, be covered with boils and leprosy;" which being
fulfilled in an instant upon the unfortunate king, he prayed to Crishna
to deliver him from his evil. At first, Crishna did not heed his
request, but finally he appeared to him, asking what his request was? He
replied, "To be freed from my distemper." The Saviour then cured him of
his distemper.<a name="FNanchor_253:3_1295" id="FNanchor_253:3_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_253:3_1295" class="fnanchor">[253:3]</a></p>

<p>Crishna was one day walking with his disciples, when "they met a poor
cripple or lame woman, having a vessel filled with spices, sweet-scented
oils, sandal-wood, saffron, civet and other perfumes. Crishna making a
halt, she made a certain sign with her finger on his forehead, <i>casting
the rest upon his head</i>. Crishna asking her what it was she would
request of him, the woman replied, nothing but the use of my limbs.
Crishna, then, setting his foot upon hers, and taking her by the hand,
raised her from the ground, and not <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>only restored her limbs, but
renewed her age, so that, instead of a wrinkled, tawny skin, she
received a fresh and fair one in an instant. At her request, Crishna and
his company lodged in her house."<a name="FNanchor_254:1_1296" id="FNanchor_254:1_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_254:1_1296" class="fnanchor">[254:1]</a></p>

<p>On another occasion, Crishna having requested a learned Brahman to ask
of him whatever boon he most desired, the Brahman said, "Above all
things, I desire to have my two dead sons restored to life." Crishna
assured him that this should be done, and immediately the two young men
were restored to life and brought to their father.<a name="FNanchor_254:2_1297" id="FNanchor_254:2_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_254:2_1297" class="fnanchor">[254:2]</a></p>

<p>The learned Orientalist, Thomas Maurice, after speaking of the miracles
performed by Crishna, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In regard to the numerous miracles wrought by Crishna, it
should be remembered that miracles are never wanting to the
decoration of an Indian romance; they are, in fact, the life
and soul of the vast machine; nor is it at all a subject of
wonder that the dead should be raised to life in a history
expressly intended, like all other sacred fables of Indian
fabrication, for the propagation and support of the whimsical
doctrine of the Metempsychosis."<a name="FNanchor_254:3_1298" id="FNanchor_254:3_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_254:3_1298" class="fnanchor">[254:3]</a></p></div>

<p>To speak thus of the miracles of Christ Jesus, would, of course, be
heresy&mdash;although what applies to the miracles of Crishna apply to those
of Jesus&mdash;we, therefore, find this gentleman branding as "<i>infidel</i>" a
learned French orientalist who was guilty of doing this thing.</p>

<p><i>Buddha</i> performed great miracles for the good of mankind, and the
legends concerning him are full of the most extravagant prodigies and
wonders.<a name="FNanchor_254:4_1299" id="FNanchor_254:4_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_254:4_1299" class="fnanchor">[254:4]</a> "By miracles and preaching," says Burnouf, "was the
religion of Buddha established."</p>

<p>R. Spence Hardy says of Buddha:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"All the principal events of his life are represented as being
attended by incredible prodigies. He could pass through the
air at will, and know the thoughts of all beings."<a name="FNanchor_254:5_1300" id="FNanchor_254:5_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_254:5_1300" class="fnanchor">[254:5]</a></p></div>

<p>Prof. Max M&uuml;ller says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Buddhist legends teem with miracles attributed to Buddha
and his disciples&mdash;miracles which in wonderfulness certainly
surpass the miracles of any other religion."<a name="FNanchor_254:6_1301" id="FNanchor_254:6_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_254:6_1301" class="fnanchor">[254:6]</a></p></div>

<p>Buddha was at one time going from the city of Rohita-vastu to the city
of Benares, when, coming to the banks of the river Ganges, and wishing
to go across, he addressed himself to the owner of a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>ferry-boat, thus;
"Hail! respectable sir! I pray you take me across the river in your
boat!" To this the boatman replied, "If you can pay me the fare, I will
willingly take you across the river." Buddha said, "Whence shall I
procure money to pay you your fare, I, who have given up all worldly
wealth and riches, &amp;c." The boatman still refusing to take him across,
Buddha, pointing to a flock of geese flying from the south to the north
banks of the Ganges, said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"See yonder geese in fellowship passing o'er the Ganges,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">They ask not as to fare of any boatman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">But each by his inherent strength of body<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Flies through the air as pleases him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">So, by my power of spiritual energy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Will I transport myself across the river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Even though the waters on this southern bank<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Stood up as high and firm as (Mount) Semeru."<a name="FNanchor_255:1_1302" id="FNanchor_255:1_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_255:1_1302" class="fnanchor">[255:1]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He then floats through the air across the stream.</p>

<p>In the <i>Lalita Vistara</i> Buddha is called the "Great Physician" who is to
"dull all human pain." At his appearance the "sick are healed, the deaf
are cured, the blind see, the poor are relieved." He visits the sick
man, Su-ta, and heals soul as well as body.</p>

<p>At Vaisali, a pest like modern cholera was depopulating the kingdom, due
to an accumulation of festering corpses. Buddha, summoned, caused a
strong rain which carried away the dead bodies and cured every one. At
Gaudh&acirc;r&acirc; was an old mendicant afflicted with a disease so loathsome that
none of his brother monks could go near him on account of his fetid
humors and stinking condition. The "Great Physician" was, however, not
to be deterred; he washed the poor old man and attended to his maladies.
A disciple had his feet hacked off by an unjust king, and Buddha cured
even him. To convert certain skeptical villagers near Sr&acirc;vast&icirc;, Buddha
showed them a man walking across the deep and rapid river without
immersing his feet. P&ucirc;rna, one of Buddha's disciples, had a brother in
imminent danger of shipwreck in a "black storm." The "spirits that are
favorable to P&ucirc;rna and Arya" apprised him of this and he at once
performed the miracle of transporting himself to the deck of the ship.
"Immediately the black tempest ceased, as if Sumera arrested it."<a name="FNanchor_255:2_1303" id="FNanchor_255:2_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_255:2_1303" class="fnanchor">[255:2]</a></p>

<p>When Buddha was told that a woman was suffering in severe labor, unable
to bring forth, he said, Go and say: "I have never knowingly put any
creature to death since I was born; by the virtue <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>of this obedience may
you be free from pain!" When these words were repeated in the presence
of the mother, the child was instantly born with ease.<a name="FNanchor_256:1_1304" id="FNanchor_256:1_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_256:1_1304" class="fnanchor">[256:1]</a></p>

<p>Innumerable are the miracles ascribed to Buddhist saints, and to others
who followed their example. Their garments, and the staffs with which
they walked, are supposed to imbibe some mysterious power, and blessed
are they who are allowed to touch them.<a name="FNanchor_256:2_1305" id="FNanchor_256:2_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_256:2_1305" class="fnanchor">[256:2]</a> A Buddhist saint who
attains the power called "<i>perfection</i>," is able to rise and float along
through the air.<a name="FNanchor_256:3_1306" id="FNanchor_256:3_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_256:3_1306" class="fnanchor">[256:3]</a> Having this power, the saint exercises it by
mere determination of his will, his body becoming imponderous, as when a
man in the common human state determines to leap, and leaps. Buddhist
annals relate the performance of the miraculous suspension by Gautama
Buddha, himself, as well as by other <i>saints</i>.<a name="FNanchor_256:4_1307" id="FNanchor_256:4_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_256:4_1307" class="fnanchor">[256:4]</a></p>

<p>In the year 217 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, a Buddhist missionary priest, called by the
Chinese historians Shih-le-fang, came from "the west" into Shan-se,
accompanied by eighteen other priests, with their sacred books, in order
to propagate the faith of Buddha. The emperor, disliking foreigners and
exotic customs, imprisoned the missionaries; but an angel, genii, or
spirit, came and opened the prison door, and liberated them.<a name="FNanchor_256:5_1308" id="FNanchor_256:5_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_256:5_1308" class="fnanchor">[256:5]</a></p>

<p>Here is a third edition of "Peter in prison," for we have already seen
that the Hindoo sage Vasudeva was liberated from prison in like manner.</p>

<p><i>Zoroaster</i>, the founder of the religion of the Persians, opposed his
persecutors by performing miracles, in order to confirm his divine
mission.<a name="FNanchor_256:6_1309" id="FNanchor_256:6_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_256:6_1309" class="fnanchor">[256:6]</a></p>

<p><i>Bochia</i> of the Persians also performed miracles; the places where he
performed them were consecrated, and people flocked in crowds to visit
them.<a name="FNanchor_256:7_1310" id="FNanchor_256:7_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_256:7_1310" class="fnanchor">[256:7]</a></p>

<p><i>Horus</i>, the Egyptian Saviour, performed great miracles, among which was
that of raising the dead to life.<a name="FNanchor_256:8_1311" id="FNanchor_256:8_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_256:8_1311" class="fnanchor">[256:8]</a></p>

<p><i>Osiris</i> of Egypt also performed great miracles;<a name="FNanchor_256:9_1312" id="FNanchor_256:9_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_256:9_1312" class="fnanchor">[256:9]</a> and so did the
virgin goddess <i>Isis</i>.</p>

<p>Pilgrimages were made to the temples of Isis, in Egypt, by the sick.
Diodorus, the Grecian historian, says that:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"Those who go to consult in dreams the goddess Isis recover
perfect health. Many whose cure has been despaired of by
physicians have by this means been saved, and others who have
long been deprived of sight, or of some other part of the
body, by taking refuge, so to speak, in the arms of the
goddess, have been restored to the enjoyment of their
faculties."<a name="FNanchor_257:1_1313" id="FNanchor_257:1_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_257:1_1313" class="fnanchor">[257:1]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Serapis</i>, the Egyptian Saviour, performed great miracles, principally
those of healing the sick. He was called "The Healer of the
World."<a name="FNanchor_257:2_1314" id="FNanchor_257:2_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_257:2_1314" class="fnanchor">[257:2]</a></p>

<p><i>Marduk</i>, the Assyrian God, the "Logos," the "Eldest Son of Hea;" "He
who made Heaven and Earth;" the "Merciful One;" the "Life-Giver," &amp;c.,
performed great miracles, among which was that of raising the dead to
life.<a name="FNanchor_257:3_1315" id="FNanchor_257:3_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_257:3_1315" class="fnanchor">[257:3]</a></p>

<p><i>Bacchus</i>, son of Zeus by the virgin Semele, was a great performer of
miracles, among which may be mentioned his changing water into
wine,<a name="FNanchor_257:4_1316" id="FNanchor_257:4_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_257:4_1316" class="fnanchor">[257:4]</a> as it is recorded of Jesus in the Gospels.</p>

<p>"In his gentler aspects he is the giver of joy, the healer of
sicknesses, the guardian against plagues. As such he is even a law-giver
and a promoter of peace and concord. As kindling new or strange thoughts
in the mind, he is a giver of wisdom and the revealer of hidden secrets
of the future."<a name="FNanchor_257:5_1317" id="FNanchor_257:5_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_257:5_1317" class="fnanchor">[257:5]</a></p>

<p>The legends related of this god state that on one occasion Pantheus,
King of Thebes, sent his attendants to seize Bacchus, the "vagabond
leader of a faction"&mdash;as he called him. This they were unable to do, as
the multitude who followed him were too numerous. They succeeded,
however, in capturing one of his disciples, Acetes, who was led away and
shut up fast in prison; but while they were getting ready the
instruments of execution, <i>the prison doors came open of their own
accord, and the chains fell from his limbs</i>, and when they looked for
him he was nowhere to be found.<a name="FNanchor_257:6_1318" id="FNanchor_257:6_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_257:6_1318" class="fnanchor">[257:6]</a> Here is still another edition of
"Peter in prison."</p>

<p><i>&AElig;sculapius</i> was another great performer of miracles. The ancient Greeks
said of him that he not only cured the sick of the most malignant
diseases, <i>but even raised the dead</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p><p>A writer in Bell's Pantheon says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As the Greeks always carried the encomiums of their great men
beyond the truth, so they feigned that &AElig;sculapius was so
expert in medicine as not only to cure the sick, but even to
raise the dead."<a name="FNanchor_258:1_1319" id="FNanchor_258:1_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_258:1_1319" class="fnanchor">[258:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Eusebius, the ecclesiastical historian, speaking of &AElig;sculapius, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He sometimes appeared unto them (the Cilicians) in dreams and
visions, and sometimes restored the sick to health."</p></div>

<p>He claims, however, that this was the work of the <span class="smcap">Devil</span>, "who by this
means did withdraw the minds of men from the knowledge of the <i>true</i>
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span>."<a name="FNanchor_258:2_1320" id="FNanchor_258:2_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_258:2_1320" class="fnanchor">[258:2]</a></p>

<p>For many years after the death of &AElig;sculapius, miracles continued to be
performed by the efficacy of faith in his name. Patients were conveyed
to the temple of &AElig;sculapius, and there cured of their disease. A short
statement of the symptoms of each case, and the remedy employed, were
inscribed on tablets and hung up in the temples.<a name="FNanchor_258:3_1321" id="FNanchor_258:3_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_258:3_1321" class="fnanchor">[258:3]</a> There were also
a multitude of eyes, ears, hands, feet, and other members of the human
body, made of wax, silver, or gold, and presented by those whom the god
had cured of blindness, deafness, and other diseases.<a name="FNanchor_258:4_1322" id="FNanchor_258:4_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_258:4_1322" class="fnanchor">[258:4]</a></p>

<p>Marinus, a scholar of the philosopher Proclus, relates one of these
remarkable cures, in the life of his master. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Asclipigenia, a young maiden who had lived with her parents,
was seized with a grievous distemper, incurable by the
physicians. All help from the physicians failing, the father
applied to the philosopher, earnestly entreating him to pray
for his daughter. Proclus, full of faith, went to the temple
of &AElig;sculapius, intending to pray for the sick young woman to
the god&mdash;for the city (Athens) was at that time blessed in
him, and still enjoyed the undemolished temple of <span class="smcap">The
Saviour</span>&mdash;but while he was praying, a sudden change appeared in
the damsel, and she immediately became convalescent, for the
<i>Saviour</i>, &AElig;sculapius, as being God, easily healed
her."<a name="FNanchor_258:5_1323" id="FNanchor_258:5_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_258:5_1323" class="fnanchor">[258:5]</a></p></div>

<p>Dr. Conyers Middleton says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Whatever proof the primitive (Christian) Church might have
among themselves, of the miraculous gift, yet it could have
but little effect towards making proselytes among those who
pretended to the same gift&mdash;possessed more largely and exerted
more openly, than in the private assemblies of the Christians.
For in the temples of <i>&AElig;sculapius</i>, all kinds of diseases were
believed to be publicly cured, by the pretended help of that
deity, in proof of which there were erected in each temple,
columns or tables of brass or marble, on which a distinct
narrative of each particular cure was inscribed.
Pausanias<a name="FNanchor_258:6_1324" id="FNanchor_258:6_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_258:6_1324" class="fnanchor">[258:6]</a> writes that in the temple <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>at Epidaurus there
were many columns anciently of this kind, and six of them
remaining to his time, <i>inscribed with the names of men and
women who had been cured by the god</i>, with an account of their
several cases, and the method of their cure; and that there
was an old pillar besides, which stood apart, dedicated to the
memory of Hippolytus, <i>who had been raised from the dead</i>.
Strabo, also, another grave writer, informs us that these
temples were constantly filled with the sick, imploring the
help of the god, and that they had tables hanging around them,
in which all the miraculous cures were described. There is a
remarkable fragment of one of these tables still extant, and
exhibited by Gruter in his collection, as it was found in the
ruins of &AElig;sculapius's temple in the Island of the Tiber, in
Rome, which gives an account of two blind men restored to
sight by &AElig;sculapius, in the open view,<a name="FNanchor_259:1_1325" id="FNanchor_259:1_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_259:1_1325" class="fnanchor">[259:1]</a> and with the
loud acclamation of the people, acknowledging the manifest
power of the god."<a name="FNanchor_259:2_1326" id="FNanchor_259:2_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_259:2_1326" class="fnanchor">[259:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Livy, the most illustrious of Roman historians (born <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> 61), tells us
that temples of <i>heathen gods</i> were rich in the number of offerings
<i>which the people used to make in return for the cures and benefits
which they received from them</i>.<a name="FNanchor_259:3_1327" id="FNanchor_259:3_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_259:3_1327" class="fnanchor">[259:3]</a></p>

<p>A writer in <i>Bell's Pantheon</i> says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Making presents to the gods was a custom even from the
earliest times, either to deprecate their wrath, obtain some
benefit, or acknowledge some favor. These donations consisted
of garlands, garments, cups of gold, or whatever conduced to
the decoration or splendor of their temples. They were
sometimes laid on the floor, sometimes hung upon the walls,
doors, pillars, roof, or any other conspicuous place.
Sometimes the occasion of the dedication was inscribed, either
upon the thing itself, or upon a tablet hung up with
it."<a name="FNanchor_259:4_1328" id="FNanchor_259:4_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_259:4_1328" class="fnanchor">[259:4]</a></p></div>

<p>No one custom of antiquity is so frequently mentioned by ancient
historians, as the practice which was so common among the <i>heathens</i>, of
making votive offerings to their deities, and hanging them up in their
temples, many of which are preserved to this day, viz., images of metal,
stone, or clay, as well as legs, arms, and other parts of the body, <i>in
testimony of some divine cure effected in that particular
member</i>.<a name="FNanchor_259:5_1329" id="FNanchor_259:5_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_259:5_1329" class="fnanchor">[259:5]</a></p>

<p>Horace says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>It was the custom of offering <i>ex-votos</i> of <i>Priapic</i> forms, at the
church of Isernia, in the <i>Christian</i> kingdom of Naples, during the last
century, which induced Mr. R. Payne Knight to compile his remarkable
work on Phallic Worship.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p><p>Juvenal, who wrote <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 81-96, says of the goddess <i>Isis</i>, whose
religion was at that time in the greatest vogue at Rome, that the
painters get their livelihood out of her. This was because "the most
common of all offerings (made by the heathen to their deities) were
<i>pictures</i> presenting the history of the miraculous cure or deliverance,
vouchsafed upon the vow of the donor."<a name="FNanchor_260:1_1330" id="FNanchor_260:1_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_260:1_1330" class="fnanchor">[260:1]</a> One of their prayers ran

<p>In <i>Chambers's Encyclop&aelig;dia</i> may be found the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Patients that were cured of their ailments (by <i>&AElig;sculapius</i>,
or through faith in him) hung up a tablet in his temple,
recording the name, the disease, and the manner of cure. <i>Many

<p>Alexander S. Murray, of the department of Greek and Roman Antiquities in
the British Museum, speaking of the miracles performed by <i>&AElig;sculapius</i>,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A person who had recovered from a local illness would dictate
a sculptured representation of the part that had been
affected. <i>Of such sculptures there are a number of examples

<p>Justin Martyr, in his <i>Apology</i> for the Christian religion, addressed to
the Emperor Hadrian, says:</p>

<p>At a time when the Romans were infested with the plague, having
consulted their sacred books, they learned that in order to be delivered
from it, they were to go in quest of <i>&AElig;sculapius</i> at Epidaurus;
accordingly, an embassy was appointed of ten senators, at the head of
whom was Quintus Ogulnius, and the worship of &AElig;sculapius was established
at Rome, <span class="allcapsc">A. U. C.</span> 462, that is, <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> 288. But the most remarkable
coincidence is that the worship of this god continued with scarcely any
diminished splendor, for several hundred years after the establishment
of Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_260:6_1335" id="FNanchor_260:6_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_260:6_1335" class="fnanchor">[260:6]</a></p>

<p>Hermes or Mercury, the Lord's Messenger, was a wonder-worker. The staff
or rod which Hermes received from Phoibos (Apollo), <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>and which connects
this myth with the special emblem of Vishnu (the Hindoo Saviour), was
regarded as denoting his heraldic office. It was, however, always
endowed with magic properties, and had the power even of raising the
dead.<a name="FNanchor_261:1_1336" id="FNanchor_261:1_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_261:1_1336" class="fnanchor">[261:1]</a></p>

<p>Herodotus, the Grecian historian, relates a wonderful miracle which
happened among the <i>Spartans</i>, many centuries before the time assigned
for the birth of Christ Jesus. The story is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A Spartan couple of great wealth and influence, had a daughter
born to them who was a cripple from birth. Her nurse,
perceiving that she was misshapen, and knowing her to be the
daughter of opulent persons, and deformed, and seeing,
moreover, that her parents considered her form a great
misfortune, considering these several circumstances, devised
the following plan. She carried her every day to the temple of
the Goddess <i>Helen</i>, and standing before her image, prayed to
the goddess to free the child from its deformity. One day, as
the nurse was going out of the temple, a woman appeared to
her, and having appeared, asked what she was carrying in her
arms; and she answered that she was carrying an infant;
whereupon she bid her show it to her, but the nurse refused,
for she had been forbidden by the parents to show the child to
any one. The woman, however&mdash;who was none other than the
Goddess herself&mdash;urged her by all means to show it to her, and
the nurse, seeing that the woman was so very anxious to see
the child, at length showed it; upon which she, stroking the
head of the child with her hands, said that she would surpass
all the women in Sparta in beauty. From that day her
appearance began to change, her deformed limbs became
symmetrical, and when she reached the age for marriage she was
the most beautiful woman in all Sparta.<a name="FNanchor_261:2_1337" id="FNanchor_261:2_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_261:2_1337" class="fnanchor">[261:2]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Apollonius</i> of Tyana, in Cappadocia, who was born in the latter part of
the reign of Augustus, about four years before the time assigned for the
birth of Jesus, and who was therefore contemporary with him, was
celebrated for the wonderful miracles he performed. Oracles in various
places declared that he was endowed with a portion of Apollo's power to
cure diseases, and foretell events; and those who were affected were
commanded to apply to him. The priests of Iona made over the diseased to
his care, and his cures were considered so remarkable, that divine
honors were decreed to him.<a name="FNanchor_261:3_1338" id="FNanchor_261:3_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_261:3_1338" class="fnanchor">[261:3]</a></p>

<p>He at one time went to Ephesus, but as the inhabitants did not hearken
to his preaching, he left there and went to Smyrna, where he was well
received by the inhabitants. While there, ambassadors <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>came from
Ephesus, begging him to return to that city, where a terrible plague was
raging, <i>as he had prophesied</i>. He went immediately, and as soon as he
arrived, he said to the Ephesians: "Be not dejected, I will this day put
a stop to the disease." According to his words, the pestilence was
stayed, and the people erected a statue to him, in token of their
gratitude.<a name="FNanchor_262:1_1339" id="FNanchor_262:1_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_262:1_1339" class="fnanchor">[262:1]</a></p>

<p>In the city of Athens, there was one of the dissipated young citizens,
who laughed and cried by turns, and talked and sang to himself, without
apparent cause. His friends supposed these habits were the effects of
early intemperance, but Apollonius, who happened to meet the young man,
told him he was possessed of a <i>demon</i>; and, as soon as he fixed his
eyes upon him, the demon broke out into all those horrid, violent
expressions used by people on the rack, and then swore he would depart
out of the youth, and never enter another.<a name="FNanchor_262:2_1340" id="FNanchor_262:2_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_262:2_1340" class="fnanchor">[262:2]</a> The young man had not
been aware that he was possessed by a devil, but from that moment, his
wild, disturbed looks changed, he became very temperate, and assumed the
garb of a Pythagorean philosopher.</p>

<p>Apollonius went to Rome, and arrived there after the emperor Nero had
passed very severe laws against <i>magicians</i>. He was met on the way by a
person who advised him to turn back and not enter the city, saying that
all who wore the philosopher's garb were in danger of being arrested as
magicians. He heeded not these words of warning, but proceeded on his
way, and entered the city. It was not long before he became an object of
suspicion, was closely watched, and finally arrested, but when his
accusers appeared before the tribunal and unrolled the parchment on
which the charges against him had been written, they found that all the
characters had disappeared. Apollonius made such an impression on the
magistrates by the bold tone he assumed, that he was allowed to go where
he pleased.<a name="FNanchor_262:3_1341" id="FNanchor_262:3_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_262:3_1341" class="fnanchor">[262:3]</a></p>

<p>Many miracles were performed by him while in Rome, among others may be
mentioned his restoring a <i>dead maiden to life</i>.</p>

<p>She belonged to a family of rank, and was just about to be married, when
she died suddenly. Apollonius met the funeral procession that was
conveying her body to the tomb. He asked them to set down the bier,
saying to her betrothed: "I will dry up the tears you are shedding for
this maiden." They supposed he was going to pronounce a funeral oration,
but he merely <i>took her hand</i>, bent over her, and uttered a few words in
a low tone. She opened <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>her eyes, and began to speak, and was carried
back alive and well to her father's house.<a name="FNanchor_263:1_1342" id="FNanchor_263:1_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_263:1_1342" class="fnanchor">[263:1]</a></p>

<p>Passing through Tarsus, in his travels, a young man was pointed out to
him who had been bitten thirty days before by a mad dog, and who was
then running on all fours, barking and howling. Apollonius took his case
in hand, and it was not long before the young man was restored to his
right mind.<a name="FNanchor_263:2_1343" id="FNanchor_263:2_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_263:2_1343" class="fnanchor">[263:2]</a></p>

<p>Domitian, Emperor of Rome, caused Apollonius to be arrested, during one
of his visits to that city, on charge of allowing himself to be
worshiped (the people having given him <i>divine honors</i>), speaking
against the reigning powers, and pretending that his words were inspired
by the gods. He was taken, loaded with irons, and cast into prison. "I
have bound you," said the emperor, "and you will not escape me."</p>

<p>Apollonius was one day visited in his prison by his steadfast disciple,
Damus, who asked him when he thought he should recover his liberty,
whereupon he answered: "This instant, if it depended upon myself," and
drawing his legs out of the shackles, he added: "Keep up your spirits,
you see the freedom I enjoy." He was brought to trial not long after,
and so defended himself, that the emperor was induced to acquit him, but
forbade him to leave Rome. Apollonius then addressed the emperor, and
ended by saying: "You cannot kill me, because I am not mortal;" and as
soon as he had said these words, <i>he vanished from the tribunal</i>.<a name="FNanchor_263:3_1344" id="FNanchor_263:3_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_263:3_1344" class="fnanchor">[263:3]</a>
Damus (the disciple who had visited him in prison) had previously been
sent away from Rome, with the promise of his master that he would soon
rejoin him. Apollonius vanished from the presence of the emperor (at
Rome) at noon. <i>On the evening of the same day, he suddenly appeared
before Damus and some other friends who were at Puteoli, more than a
hundred miles from Rome.</i> They started, being doubtful whether or not it
was his spirit, but he stretched out his hand, saying: "Take it, and if
I escape from you regard me as an apparition."<a name="FNanchor_263:4_1345" id="FNanchor_263:4_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_263:4_1345" class="fnanchor">[263:4]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p><p>When Apollonius had told his disciples that he had made his defense in
Rome, only a few hours before, they marveled how he could have performed
the journey so rapidly. He, in reply, said that they must ascribe it to
a god.<a name="FNanchor_264:1_1346" id="FNanchor_264:1_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_264:1_1346" class="fnanchor">[264:1]</a></p>

<p>The Empress Julia, wife of Alexander Severus, was so much interested in
the history of Apollonius, that she requested Flavius Philostratus, an
Athenian author of reputation, to write an account of him. The early
Christian Fathers, alluding to this life of Apollonius, do not deny the
miracles it recounts, but attribute to them the aid of evil
spirits.<a name="FNanchor_264:2_1347" id="FNanchor_264:2_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_264:2_1347" class="fnanchor">[264:2]</a></p>

<p>Justin Martyr was one of the believers in the miracles performed by
Apollonius, and by others through him, for he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"How is it that the talismans of Apollonius have power in
certain members of creation? for they prevent, <i>as we see</i>,
the fury of the waves, and the violence of the winds, and the
attacks of wild beasts, and whilst <i>our</i> Lord's miracles <i>are
preserved by tradition alone, those of Apollonius are most
numerous, and actually manifested in present facts, so as to
lead astray all beholders</i>."<a name="FNanchor_264:3_1348" id="FNanchor_264:3_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_264:3_1348" class="fnanchor">[264:3]</a></p></div>

<p>So much for Apollonius. We will now speak of another miracle performer,
<i>Simon Magus</i>.</p>

<p>Simon the Samaritan, generally called Simon <i>Magus</i>, produced marked
effects on the times succeeding him; being the progenitor of a large
class of sects, which long troubled the Christian churches.</p>

<p>In the time of Jesus and Simon Magus it was almost universally believed
that men could foretell events, cure diseases, and obtain control over
the forces of nature, by the aid of spirits, if they knew how to invoke
them. It was Simon's proficiency in this occult science which gained him
the surname of <i>Magus</i>, or <i>Magician</i>.</p>

<p>The writer of the eighth chapter of "<i>The Acts of the Apostles</i>" informs
us that when Philip went into Samaria, "to preach Christ unto them," he
found there "a certain man called Simon, which beforetime in the same
city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that
himself was some great one. To whom they all gave heed, from the least
to the greatest, saying: This man is the great power of God."<a name="FNanchor_264:4_1349" id="FNanchor_264:4_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_264:4_1349" class="fnanchor">[264:4]</a></p>

<p>Simon traveled about preaching, and made many proselytes. He professed
to be "<i>The Wisdom of God</i>," "<i>The Word of God</i>," <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>"<i>The Paraclete</i>, or
<i>Comforter</i>," "<i>The Image of the Eternal Father, Manifested in the
Flesh</i>," and his followers claimed that he was "<i>The First Born of the
Supreme</i>."<a name="FNanchor_265:1_1350" id="FNanchor_265:1_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_265:1_1350" class="fnanchor">[265:1]</a> All of these are titles, which, in after years, were
applied to Christ Jesus. His followers had a gospel called "<i>The Four
Corners of the World</i>," which reminds us of the reason given by Iren&aelig;us,
for there being <i>four</i> Gospels among the Christians. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is impossible that there could be more or less than
<i>four</i>. For there are <i>four</i> climates, and <i>four</i> cardinal
winds; but the <i>Gospel</i> is the pillar and foundation of the
Church, and its breath of life. The Church, therefore, was to
have <i>four pillars</i>, blowing immortality from every quarter,
and giving life to men."<a name="FNanchor_265:2_1351" id="FNanchor_265:2_1351"></a><a href="#Footnote_265:2_1351" class="fnanchor">[265:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Simon also composed some works, of which but slight fragments remain,
Christian authority having evidently destroyed them. That he made a
lively impression on his contemporaries is indicated by the subsequent
extension of his doctrines, under varied forms, by the wonderful stories
which the Christian Fathers relate of him, and by the strong dislike
they manifested toward him.</p>

<p>Eusebius, the ecclesiastical historian, says of him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The malicious power of <i>Satan</i>, enemy to all honesty, and foe
to all human salvation, brought forth at that time this
monster Simon, a father and worker of all such mischiefs, <i>as
a great adversary unto the mighty and holy Apostles</i>.</p>

<p>"Coming into the city of Rome, he was so aided by that power
which prevaileth in this world, that in short time he brought
his purpose to such a pass, that his picture was there placed
with others, and he honored as a god."<a name="FNanchor_265:3_1352" id="FNanchor_265:3_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_265:3_1352" class="fnanchor">[265:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Justin Martyr says of him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"After the ascension of <i>our</i> Savior into heaven, the DEVIL
brought forth certain men which called themselves gods, who
not only suffered no vexation of you (Romans), but attained
unto honor amongst you, by name one <i>Simon</i>, a Samaritan, born
in the village of Gitton, who (under Claudius C&aelig;sar) by the
art of <i>devils</i>, through whom he dealt, wrought devilish
enchantments, was esteemed and counted in your regal city of
Rome for a <i>god</i>, and honored by you as a <i>god</i>, with a
picture between two bridges upon the river Tibris, having this
Roman inscription: '<i>Simoni deo Sancto</i>' (To Simon the Holy
God). And in manner all the Samaritans, and certain also of
other nations, do worship him, acknowledging him for their
chief god."<a name="FNanchor_265:4_1353" id="FNanchor_265:4_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_265:4_1353" class="fnanchor">[265:4]</a></p></div>

<p>According to accounts given by several other Christian Fathers, he could
make his appearance wherever he pleased to be at any moment; could poise
himself on the air; make inanimate things <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>move without visible
assistance; produce trees from the earth suddenly; cause a stick to reap
without hands; change himself into the likeness of any other person, or
even into the forms of animals; fling himself from high precipices
unhurt, walk through the streets accompanied by spirits of the dead; and
many other such like performances.<a name="FNanchor_266:1_1354" id="FNanchor_266:1_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_266:1_1354" class="fnanchor">[266:1]</a></p>

<p>Simon went to Rome, where he gave himself out to be an "Incarnate Spirit
of God."<a name="FNanchor_266:2_1355" id="FNanchor_266:2_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_266:2_1355" class="fnanchor">[266:2]</a> He became a favorite with the Emperor Claudius, and
afterwards with Nero. His Christian opponents, as we have seen in the
cases cited above, did not deny the miracles attributed to him, but said
they were done through the agency of evil spirits, which was a common
opinion among the Fathers. They claimed that every <i>magician</i> had an
attendant evil spirit, who came when summoned, obeyed his commands, and
taught him ceremonies and forms of words, by which he was able to do
supernatural things. In this way they were accustomed to account for all
the miracles performed by Gentiles and heretics.<a name="FNanchor_266:3_1356" id="FNanchor_266:3_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_266:3_1356" class="fnanchor">[266:3]</a></p>

<p><i>Menander</i>&mdash;who was called the "Wonder-Worker"&mdash;was another great
performer of miracles. Eusebius, speaking of him, says that he was
skilled in magical art, and performed <i>devilish</i> operations; and that
"as yet there be divers which can testify the same of him."<a name="FNanchor_266:4_1357" id="FNanchor_266:4_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_266:4_1357" class="fnanchor">[266:4]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Conyers Middleton, speaking on this subject, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was universally received and believed through all ages of
the primitive church, that there was a number of magicians,
necromancers, or conjurors, both among the <i>Gentiles</i>, and the
<i>heretical Christians</i>, who had each their peculiar <i>demon</i> or
evil spirit, for their associates, perpetually attending on
their persons and obsequious to their commands, by whose help
they could perform miracles, foretell future events, call up
the souls of the dead, exhibit them to open view, and infuse
into people whatever dreams or visions they saw fit, all which
is constantly affirmed by the primitive writers and
apologists, and commonly applied by them to prove the
immortality of the soul."<a name="FNanchor_266:5_1358" id="FNanchor_266:5_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_266:5_1358" class="fnanchor">[266:5]</a></p></div>

<p>After quoting from Justin Martyr, who says that these <i>magicians</i> could
convince any one "that the souls of men exist still after death," he
continues by saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Lactantius, speaking of certain philosophers who held that
the soul perished with the body, says: 'they durst not have
declared such an opinion, in the presence of <i>any magician</i>,
for if they had done it, he would have confuted them <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>upon the
spot, by sensible experiments; <i>by calling up souls from the
dead, and rendering them visible to human eyes, and making
them speak and foretell future events</i>."<a name="FNanchor_267:1_1359" id="FNanchor_267:1_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_267:1_1359" class="fnanchor">[267:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The Christian Father Theophilus, Bishop of Antioch, who was contemporary
with Iren&aelig;us (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 177-202), went so far as to declare that it was evil
spirits who inspired the old poets and prophets of Greece and Rome. He
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The truth of this is manifestly shown; because those who are
possessed by devils, even at this day, are sometimes exorcised
by us in the name of God; and the seducing spirits confess
themselves to be the same demons who before inspired the
Gentile poets."<a name="FNanchor_267:2_1360" id="FNanchor_267:2_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_267:2_1360" class="fnanchor">[267:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Even in the second century after Christianity, foreign conjurors were
professing to exhibit miracles among the Greeks. Lucian gives an account
of one of these "foreign barbarians"&mdash;as he calls them<a name="FNanchor_267:3_1361" id="FNanchor_267:3_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_267:3_1361" class="fnanchor">[267:3]</a>&mdash;and says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I believed and was overcome in spite of my resistance, for
what was I to do when I saw him carried through the air in
daylight, and walking on the water,<a name="FNanchor_267:4_1362" id="FNanchor_267:4_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_267:4_1362" class="fnanchor">[267:4]</a> and passing
leisurely and slowly through the fire?"<a name="FNanchor_267:5_1363" id="FNanchor_267:5_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_267:5_1363" class="fnanchor">[267:5]</a></p></div>

<p>He further tells us that this "foreign barbarian" was able to raise the
dead to life.<a name="FNanchor_267:6_1364" id="FNanchor_267:6_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_267:6_1364" class="fnanchor">[267:6]</a></p>

<p>Athenagoras, a Christian Father who flourished during the latter part of
the second century, says on this subject:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We (Christians) do not deny that in several places, cities,
and countries, there are some extraordinary works performed in
the name of <i>idols</i>," <i>i. e.</i>, heathen gods.<a name="FNanchor_267:7_1365" id="FNanchor_267:7_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_267:7_1365" class="fnanchor">[267:7]</a></p></div>

<p>Miracles were not uncommon things among the Jews before and during the
time of Christ Jesus. Casting out devils was an every-day
occurrence,<a name="FNanchor_267:8_1366" id="FNanchor_267:8_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_267:8_1366" class="fnanchor">[267:8]</a> and miracles frequently happened to confirm the
sayings of Rabbis. One cried out, when his opinion was disputed, "May
this tree prove that I am right!" and forthwith the tree was torn up by
the roots, and hurled a hundred ells off. But <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>his opponents declared
that a tree could prove nothing. "May this stream, then, witness for
me!" cried Eliezar, and at once it flowed the opposite way.<a name="FNanchor_268:1_1367" id="FNanchor_268:1_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_268:1_1367" class="fnanchor">[268:1]</a></p>

<p>Josephus, the Jewish historian, tells us that <i>King Solomon</i> was expert
in casting out devils who had taken possession of the body of mortals.
This gift was also possessed by many Jews throughout different ages. He
(Josephus) relates that he saw one of his own countrymen (Eleazar)
casting out devils, in the presence of a vast multitude.<a name="FNanchor_268:2_1368" id="FNanchor_268:2_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_268:2_1368" class="fnanchor">[268:2]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Conyers Middleton says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is remarkable that all the Christian Fathers, who lay so
great a stress on the particular gift of <i>casting out devils</i>,
allow the same power both to the Jews and the Gentiles, <i>as
well before as after our Saviour's coming</i>."<a name="FNanchor_268:3_1369" id="FNanchor_268:3_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_268:3_1369" class="fnanchor">[268:3]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Vespasian</i>, who was born about ten years after the time assigned for
the birth of Christ Jesus, performed wonderful miracles, for the good of
mankind. Tacitus, the Roman historian, informs us that he cured a <i>blind
man</i> in Alexandria, by means of his spittle, and a <i>lame man</i> by the
mere touch of his foot.</p>

<p>The words of Tacitus are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Vespasian passed some months at Alexandria, having resolved
to defer his voyage to Italy till the return of summer, when
the winds, blowing in a regular direction, afford a safe and
pleasant navigation. During his residence in that city, a
number of incidents, out of the ordinary course of nature,
seemed to mark him as the peculiar favorite of the gods. A man
of mean condition, born at Alexandria, had lost his sight by a
defluxion on his eyes. He presented himself before Vespasian,
and, falling prostrate on the ground, implored the emperor to
administer a cure for his blindness. He came, he said, by the
admonition of Serapis, the god whom the superstition of the
Egyptians holds in the highest veneration. The request was,
that the emperor, with his spittle, would condescend to
moisten the poor man's face and the balls of his eyes.<a name="FNanchor_268:4_1370" id="FNanchor_268:4_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_268:4_1370" class="fnanchor">[268:4]</a>
Another, who had lost the use of his hand, inspired by the
same god, begged that he would tread on the part affected.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
In the presence of a prodigious multitude, all erect with
expectation, he advanced with an air of serenity, and hazarded
the experiment. The paralytic hand recovered its functions,
and the blind man saw the light of the sun.<a name="FNanchor_268:5_1371" id="FNanchor_268:5_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_268:5_1371" class="fnanchor">[268:5]</a> By living
witnesses, who were actually on the spot, both events are
confirmed at this hour, when deceit and flattery can hope for
no reward."<a name="FNanchor_268:6_1372" id="FNanchor_268:6_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_268:6_1372" class="fnanchor">[268:6]</a></p></div>

<p>The striking resemblance between the account of these miracles, and
those attributed to Jesus in the Gospels "<i>according to</i>" <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>Matthew and
Mark, would lead us to think that one had been copied from the other,
but when we find that Tacitus wrote his history <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 98,<a name="FNanchor_269:1_1373" id="FNanchor_269:1_1373"></a><a href="#Footnote_269:1_1373" class="fnanchor">[269:1]</a> and
that the "<i>Matthew</i>" and Mark narrators' works were not known until
<i>after</i> that time,<a name="FNanchor_269:2_1374" id="FNanchor_269:2_1374"></a><a href="#Footnote_269:2_1374" class="fnanchor">[269:2]</a> the evidence certainly is that Tacitus was
<i>not</i> the plagiarist, but that this charge must fall on the shoulders of
the Christian writers, whoever they may have been.</p>

<p>To come down to earlier times, even the religion of the Mahometans is a
religion of miracles and wonders. Mahomet, like Jesus of Nazareth, did
not claim to perform miracles, but the votaries of Mahomet are more
assured than himself of his miraculous gifts; and their confidence and
credulity increase as they are farther removed from the time and place
of his spiritual exploits. They believe or affirm that trees went forth
to meet him; that he was saluted by stones; that water gushed from his
fingers; that he fed the hungry, cured the sick, and raised the dead;
that a beam groaned to him; that a camel complained to him; that a
shoulder of mutton informed him of its being poisoned; and that both
animate and inanimate nature were equally subject to the apostle of God.
His dream of a nocturnal journey is seriously described as a real and
corporeal transaction. A mysterious animal, the Borak, conveyed him from
the temple of Mecca to that of Jerusalem; with his companion Gabriel he
successively ascended the seven heavens, and received and repaid the
salutations of the patriarchs, the prophets, and the angels in their
respective mansions. Beyond the seventh heaven, Mahomet alone was
permitted to proceed; he passed the veil of unity, approached within two
bow-shots of the throne, and felt a cold that pierced him to the heart,
when his shoulder was touched by the hand of God. After a familiar,
though important conversation, he descended to Jerusalem, remounted the
Borak, returned to Mecca, and performed in the tenth part of a night the
journey of many thousand years. His resistless word split asunder the
orb of the moon, and the obedient planet stooped from her station in the
sky.<a name="FNanchor_269:3_1375" id="FNanchor_269:3_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_269:3_1375" class="fnanchor">[269:3]</a></p>

<p>These and many other wonders, similar in character to the story of Jesus
sending the demons into the swine, are related of Mahomet by his
followers.</p>

<p>It is very certain that the same circumstances which are claimed to have
taken place with respect to the Christian religion, are also claimed to
have taken place in the religions of Crishna, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>Buddha, Zoroaster,
&AElig;sculapius, Bacchus, Apollonius, Simon Magus, &amp;c. Histories of these
persons, with miracles, relics, circumstances of locality, suitable to
them, were as common, as well authenticated (if not better), and as much
believed by the devotees as were those relating to Jesus.</p>

<p>All the Christian theologians which the world has yet produced have not
been able to procure any evidence of the miracles recorded in the
<i>Gospels</i>, half so strong as can be procured in evidence of miracles
performed by heathens and heathen gods, both before and after the time
of Jesus; and, as they cannot do this, let them give us a reason why we
should reject the one and receive the other. And if they cannot do this,
let them candidly confess that we must either admit them all, or reject
them all, for they all stand on the same footing.</p>

<p>In the early times of the Roman republic, in the war with the Latins,
the gods Castor and Pollux are said to have appeared on white horses in
the Roman army, which by their assistance gained a complete victory: in
memory of which, the General Posthumius vowed and built a temple to
these deities; and for a proof of the fact, there was shown, we find, in
Cicero's time (106 to 43 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>), the marks of the horses' hoofs on a
rock at Regillum, where they first appeared.<a name="FNanchor_270:1_1376" id="FNanchor_270:1_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_270:1_1376" class="fnanchor">[270:1]</a></p>

<p>Now this miracle, with those which have already been mentioned, and many
others of the same kind which could be mentioned, has as authentic an
attestation, if not more so, as any of the Gospel miracles. It has, for
instance: The decree of a senate to confirm it; visible marks on the
spot where it was transacted; and all this supported by the best authors
of antiquity, amongst whom Dionysius, of Halicarnassus, who says that
there was subsisting in his time at Rome many evident proofs of its
reality, besides a yearly festival, with a solemn sacrifice and
procession, in memory of it.<a name="FNanchor_270:2_1377" id="FNanchor_270:2_1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_270:2_1377" class="fnanchor">[270:2]</a></p>

<p>With all these evidences in favor of this miracle having really
happened, it seems to us so ridiculous, that we wonder how there could
ever have been any so simple as to believe it, yet we should believe
that Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, after he had been in the tomb
four days, our only authority being that <i>anonymous</i> book known as the
"Gospel according to St. John," which was not <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>known until after <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span>
173. Albert Barnes, in his "Lectures on the Evidences of Christianity,"
speaking of the authenticity of the Gospel miracles, makes the following
damaging confession:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"An important question is, whether there is any stronger
evidence in favor of miracles, than there is in favor of
witchcraft, or sorcery, or the re-appearance of the dead, of
ghosts, of apparitions? Is not the evidence in favor of these
as strong as any that can be adduced in favor of miracles?
Have not these things been matters of universal belief? In
what respect is the evidence in favor of the miracles of the
Bible stronger than that which can be adduced in favor of
witchcraft and sorcery? Does it differ in nature and degrees;
and if it differs, is it not in favor of witchcraft and
sorcery? Has not the evidence in favor of the latter been
derived from as competent and reliable witnesses? Has it not
been brought to us from those who saw the facts alleged? Has
it not been subjected to a close scrutiny in the courts of
justice, to cross-examination, to tortures? Has it not
convinced those of highest legal attainments; those accustomed
to sift testimony; those who understood the true principles of
evidence? Has not the evidence in favor of witchcraft and
sorcery had, what the evidence in favor of miracles has not
had, the advantage of strict judicial investigation? and been
subjected to trial, where evidence should be, before courts of
law? Have not the most eminent judges in the most civilized
and enlightened courts of Europe and America admitted the
force of such evidence, and on the ground of it committed
great numbers of innocent persons to the gallows and to the
stake? <i>I confess that of all the questions ever asked on the
subject of miracles, this is the most perplexing and the most
difficult to answer.</i> It is rather to be wondered at that it
has not been pressed with more zeal by those who deny the
reality of miracles, and that they have placed their
objections so extensively on other grounds."</p></div>

<p>It was a common adage among the Greeks, "<i>Miracles for fools</i>," and the
same proverb obtained among the shrewder Romans, in the saying: "<i>The
common people like to be deceived&mdash;deceived let them be.</i>"</p>

<p>St. Chrysostom declares that "miracles are proper only to excite
sluggish and vulgar minds, <i>men of sense have no occasion for them</i>;"
and that "they frequently carry some untoward suspicion along with
them;" and Saint Chrysostom, Jerome, Euthemius, and Theophylact, prove
by several instances, that <i>real miracles</i> had been performed by those
who were not Catholic, but heretic, Christians.<a name="FNanchor_271:1_1378" id="FNanchor_271:1_1378"></a><a href="#Footnote_271:1_1378" class="fnanchor">[271:1]</a></p>

<p>Celsus (an Epicurean philosopher, towards the close of the second
century), the first writer who entered the lists against the claims of
the Christians, in speaking of the miracles which were claimed to have
been performed by Jesus, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"His miracles, <i>granted to be true</i>, were nothing more than
the common works of those <i>enchanters</i>, who, for a few
<i>oboli</i>, will perform greater deeds in the midst of the Forum,
calling up the souls of heroes, exhibiting sumptuous banquets,
and tables covered with food, which have no reality. Such
things do not prove these jugglers to be sons of God; nor do
Christ's miracles."<a name="FNanchor_271:2_1379" id="FNanchor_271:2_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_271:2_1379" class="fnanchor">[271:2]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p><p>Celsus, in common with most of the Grecians, looked upon Christianity
as a <i>blind faith</i>, that shunned the light of reason. In speaking of the
Christians, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They are forever repeating: 'Do not examine. <i>Only believe</i>,
and thy <i>faith</i> will make thee blessed. <i>Wisdom</i> is a bad
thing in life; <i>foolishness</i> is to be preferred.'"<a name="FNanchor_272:1_1380" id="FNanchor_272:1_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_272:1_1380" class="fnanchor">[272:1]</a></p></div>

<p>He jeers at the fact that <i>ignorant men</i> were allowed to preach, and
says that "weavers, tailors, fullers, and the most illiterate and rustic
fellows," set up to teach strange paradoxes. "They openly declared that
none but the ignorant (were) fit disciples for the God they worshiped,"
and that one of their rules was, "let no man that is learned come among
us."<a name="FNanchor_272:2_1381" id="FNanchor_272:2_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_272:2_1381" class="fnanchor">[272:2]</a></p>

<p>The <i>miracles</i> claimed to have been performed by the Christians, he
attributed to <i>magic</i>,<a name="FNanchor_272:3_1382" id="FNanchor_272:3_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_272:3_1382" class="fnanchor">[272:3]</a> and considered&mdash;as we have seen
above&mdash;their miracle performers to be on the same level with all Gentile
magicians. He says that the "wonder-workers" among the Christians
"rambled about to play tricks at fairs and markets," that they never
appeared in the circles of the wiser and better sort, but always took
care to intrude themselves among the ignorant and uncultured.<a name="FNanchor_272:4_1383" id="FNanchor_272:4_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_272:4_1383" class="fnanchor">[272:4]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The magicians in Egypt (says he), cast out evil spirits, cure
diseases by a breath, call up the spirits of the dead, make
inanimate things move as if they were alive, and so influence
some uncultured men, that they produce in them whatever sights
and sounds they please. But because they do such things shall
we consider them the sons of God? Or shall we call such things
the tricks of pitiable and wicked men?"<a name="FNanchor_272:5_1384" id="FNanchor_272:5_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_272:5_1384" class="fnanchor">[272:5]</a></p></div>

<p>He believed that Jesus was like all these other wonder-workers, that is,
simply a <i>necromancer</i>, and that he learned his magical arts in
Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_272:6_1385" id="FNanchor_272:6_1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_272:6_1385" class="fnanchor">[272:6]</a> All philosophers, during the time of the Early Fathers,
answered the claims that Jesus performed miracles, in the same manner.
"They even ventured to call him a <i>magician</i> and a deceiver of the
people," says Justin Martyr,<a name="FNanchor_272:7_1386" id="FNanchor_272:7_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_272:7_1386" class="fnanchor">[272:7]</a> and St. Augustine asserted that it
was generally believed that Jesus had been initiated in <i>magical art</i> in
Egypt, and that he had written books concerning magic, one of which was
called "<i>Magia Jesu Christi</i>."<a name="FNanchor_272:8_1387" id="FNanchor_272:8_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_272:8_1387" class="fnanchor">[272:8]</a> In the Clementine Recognitions,
the charge is brought against Jesus that he did not perform his miracles
as a Jewish prophet, but as a magician, an initiate of the heathen
temples.<a name="FNanchor_272:9_1388" id="FNanchor_272:9_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_272:9_1388" class="fnanchor">[272:9]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p><p>The casting out of devils was the most frequent and among the most
striking and the oftenest appealed to of the miracles of Jesus; yet, in
the conversation between himself and the Pharisees (Matt. xii. 24-27),
he speaks of it as one that was constantly and habitually performed by
their own <i>exorcists</i>; and, so far from insinuating any difference
between the two cases, <i>expressly puts them on a level</i>.</p>

<p>One of the best proofs, and most unquestionable, that Jesus was accused
of being a <i>magician</i>, or that some of the early Christians believed him
to have been such, may be found in the representations of him performing
miracles. On a <i>sarcophagus</i> to be found in the <i>Museo Gregoriano</i>,
which is paneled with bas-reliefs, is to be seen a representation of
Jesus raising Lazarus from the grave. He is represented as a young man,
beardless, and equipped with a <i>wand</i> in the received guise of a
<i>necromancer</i>, whilst the corpse of Lazarus is swathed in bandages
exactly as an Egyptian mummy.<a name="FNanchor_273:1_1389" id="FNanchor_273:1_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_273:1_1389" class="fnanchor">[273:1]</a> On other Christian monuments
representing the miracles of Jesus, he is pictured in the same manner.
For instance, when he is represented as turning the water into wine, and
multiplying the bread in the wilderness, he is a necromancer with a
<i>wand</i> in his hand.<a name="FNanchor_273:2_1390" id="FNanchor_273:2_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_273:2_1390" class="fnanchor">[273:2]</a></p>

<p><i>Horus</i>, the Egyptian Saviour, is represented on the ancient monuments
of Egypt, <i>with a wand in his hand raising the dead to life</i>, "just as
we see Christ doing the same thing," says J. P. Lundy, "in the same way,
to Lazarus, in our Christian monuments."<a name="FNanchor_273:3_1391" id="FNanchor_273:3_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_273:3_1391" class="fnanchor">[273:3]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Conyers Middleton, speaking of the primitive Christians, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the performance of their miracles, they were always
charged with fraud and imposture, by their adversaries. Lucian
(who flourished during the second century), tells us that
whenever any crafty juggler, expert in his trade, and who knew
how to make a right use of things, went over to the
Christians, he was sure to grow rich immediately, by making a
prey of their simplicity. And Celsus represents all the
Christian wonder-workers as mere vagabonds and common cheats,
who rambled about to play their tricks at fairs and markets;
not in the circles of the wiser and the better sort, for among
such they never ventured to appear, but wherever they observed
a set of raw young fellows, slaves or fools, there they took
care to intrude themselves, and to display all their
arts."<a name="FNanchor_273:4_1392" id="FNanchor_273:4_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_273:4_1392" class="fnanchor">[273:4]</a></p></div>

<p>The same charge was constantly urged against them by Julian, Porphyry
and others. Similar sentiments were entertained by Polybius, the Pagan
philosopher, who considered all miracles as fables, invented to preserve
in the unlearned a due sense of respect for the deity.<a name="FNanchor_273:5_1393" id="FNanchor_273:5_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_273:5_1393" class="fnanchor">[273:5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p><p>Edward Gibbon, speaking of the miracles of the Christians, writes in
his familiar style as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"How shall we excuse the supine inattention of the Pagan and
philosophic world, to those evidences which were represented
by the hand of Omnipotence, not to their reason, but to their
senses? During the age of Christ, of his apostles, and of
their first disciples, the doctrine which they preached was
confirmed by innumerable prodigies. The lame walked, the blind
saw, the sick were healed, the dead were raised, demons were
expelled, and the laws of nature were frequently suspended for
the benefit of the church. But the sages of Greece and Rome
turned aside from the awful spectacle, and, pursuing the
ordinary occupations of life and study, appeared unconscious
of any alterations in the moral or physical government of the
world."<a name="FNanchor_274:1_1394" id="FNanchor_274:1_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_274:1_1394" class="fnanchor">[274:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The learned Dr. Middleton, whom we have quoted on a preceding page,
after a searching inquiry into the miraculous powers of the Christians,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"From these short hints and characters of the primitive
wonder-workers, as given both by friends and enemies, we may
fairly conclude, that the celebrated gifts of these ages were
generally engrossed and exercised by the primitive Christians,
chiefly of the laity, who used to travel about from city to
city, to assist the ordinary pastors of the church, and
preachers of the Gospel, in the conversion of Pagans, by the
extraordinary gifts with which they were supposed to be indued
by the spirit of God, and the miraculous works which they
pretended to perform.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"We have just reason to suspect that there was some original
fraud in the case; and that the strolling wonder-workers, by a
dexterity of jugglery which art, not heaven, had taught them,
imposed upon the credulity of the pious Fathers, whose strong
prejudices and ardent zeal for the interest of Christianity
would dispose them to embrace, without examination, whatever
seemed to promote so good a cause. That this was really the
case in some instances, is certain and notorious, and that it
was so in all, will appear still more probable, when we have
considered the particular characters of the several Fathers,
on whose testimony the credit of these wonderful narratives
depends."<a name="FNanchor_274:2_1395" id="FNanchor_274:2_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_274:2_1395" class="fnanchor">[274:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Again he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The pretended miracles of the primitive church were all mere
fictions, which the pious and zealous Fathers, partly from a
weak credulity, and partly from reasons of policy, believing
some perhaps to be true, and knowing all of them to be useful,
were induced to espouse and propagate, for the support of a
righteous cause."<a name="FNanchor_274:3_1396" id="FNanchor_274:3_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_274:3_1396" class="fnanchor">[274:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Origen, a Christian Father of the third century, uses the following
words in his answer to Celsus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A vast number of persons who have left those horrid
debaucheries in which they formerly wallowed, and have
professed to embrace the Christian religion, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>shall receive a
bright and massive crown when this frail and short life is
ended, <i>though they don't stand to examine the grounds on
which their faith is</i> built, nor defer their conversion till
they have a fair opportunity and capacity to apply themselves
to rational and learned studies. And since our adversaries are
continually making such a stir about our <i>taking things on
trust</i>, I answer, that we, who see plainly and have found the
vast advantage that the common people do manifestly and
frequently reap thereby (who make up by far the greater
number), I say, we (the Christian clergy), who are so well
advised of these things, <i>do professedly teach men to believe
without examination</i>."<a name="FNanchor_275:1_1397" id="FNanchor_275:1_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_275:1_1397" class="fnanchor">[275:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Origen flourished and wrote <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 225-235, which shows that at that
early day there was no rational evidence for Christianity, but it was
professedly taught, and men were supposed to believe "<i>these things</i>"
(<i>i. e.</i> the Christian legends) <i>without severe examination</i>.</p>

<p>The primitive Christians were perpetually reproached for their gross
credulity, by all their enemies. Celsus, as we have already seen,
declares that they cared neither to receive nor give any reason for
their faith, and that it was a usual saying with them: "Do not examine,
but believe only, and thy faith will save thee;" and Julian affirms
that, "the sum of all their wisdom was comprised in the single precept,
'<i>believe</i>.'"</p>

<p>Arnobius, speaking of this, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Gentiles make it their constant business to laugh at our
faith, and to lash our credulity with their facetious jokes."</p></div>

<p>The Christian Fathers defended themselves against these charges by
declaring that they did nothing more than the heathens themselves had
always done; and reminds them that they too had found the same method
useful with the uneducated or common people, who were not at leisure to
examine things, and whom they taught therefore, to believe without
reason.<a name="FNanchor_275:2_1398" id="FNanchor_275:2_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_275:2_1398" class="fnanchor">[275:2]</a></p>

<p>This "believing without reason" is illustrated in the following words of
Tertullian, a Christian Father of the second century, who reasons on the
evidence of Christianity as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I find no other means to prove myself to be impudent with
success, and happily a fool, than by my contempt of shame; as,
for instance&mdash;I maintain that the son of God was born: why am
I not ashamed of maintaining such a thing? Why! but because it
is a shameful thing. I maintain that the son of God died:
well, <i>that</i> is wholly credible because it is monstrously
absurd. I maintain that after having been buried, he rose
again: and <i>that</i> I take to be absolutely true, because it was
manifestly impossible."<a name="FNanchor_275:3_1399" id="FNanchor_275:3_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_275:3_1399" class="fnanchor">[275:3]</a></p></div>

<p>According to the very books which record the miracles of Jesus, he never
claimed to perform such deeds, and Paul declares that the great reason
why Israel did not believe Jesus to be the Messiah was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>that "the Jews
required a sign."<a name="FNanchor_276:1_1400" id="FNanchor_276:1_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_276:1_1400" class="fnanchor">[276:1]</a> He meant: "Signs and wonders are the only
proofs they will admit that any one is sent by God and is preaching the
truth. If they cannot have this palpable, external proof, they withhold
their faith."</p>

<p>A writer of the second century (John, in ch. iv. 18) makes Jesus aim at
his fellow-countrymen and contemporaries, the reproach: "Unless you see
signs and wonders, you do not believe." In connection with Paul's
declaration, given above, these words might be paraphrased: "The reason
why the Jews never believed in Jesus was that they never saw him do
signs and wonders."</p>

<p>Listen to the reply he (Jesus) made when told that if he wanted people
to believe in him he must first prove his claim by a miracle: "A wicked
and adulterous generation asks for a <i>sign</i>, and no sign shall be given
it except the sign of the prophet Jonas."<a name="FNanchor_276:2_1401" id="FNanchor_276:2_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_276:2_1401" class="fnanchor">[276:2]</a> Of course, this answer
did not in the least degree satisfy the questioners; so they presently
came to him again with a more direct request: "If the kingdom of God is,
as you say, close at hand, show us at least some <i>one</i> of the signs in
heaven which are to precede the Messianic age." What could appear more
reasonable than such a request? Every one knew that the end of the
present age was to be heralded by fearful signs in heaven. The light of
the sun was to be put out, the moon turned to blood, the stars robbed of
their brightness, and many other fearful signs were to be shown!<a name="FNanchor_276:3_1402" id="FNanchor_276:3_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_276:3_1402" class="fnanchor">[276:3]</a>
If any <i>one</i> of these could be produced, they would be content; but if
not, they must decline to surrender themselves to an idle joy which must
end in a bitter disappointment; and surely Jesus himself could hardly
expect them to believe in him on his bare word.</p>

<p><i>Historians</i> have recorded miracles said to have been performed by other
persons, but not a word is said by <i>them</i> about the miracles claimed to
have been performed by Jesus.</p>

<p>Justus of Tiberias, who was born about five years after the time
assigned for the crucifixion of Jesus, wrote a <i>Jewish History</i>. Now, if
the miracles attributed to Christ Jesus, and his death and resurrection,
had taken place in the manner described by the Gospel narrators, he
could not have failed to allude to them. But Photius, Patriarch of
Constantinople, tells us that it contained "<i>no mention of the coming of
Christ, nor of the events concerning him, nor of the prodigies he
wrought</i>." As Theodore Parker has remarked: "The miracle is of a most
<i>fluctuating</i> character. The miracle-worker of to-day is a
matter-of-fact juggler to-morrow. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>Science each year adds new wonders to
our store. The master of a locomotive steam-engine would have been
thought greater than Jupiter Tonans, or the Elohim, thirty centuries
ago."</p>

<p>In the words of Dr. Oort: "Our increased knowledge of nature has
gradually undermined the belief in the possibility of miracles, and the
time is not far distant when in the mind of every man, of any culture,
all accounts of miracles will be banished together to their proper
region&mdash;<i>that of legend</i>."</p>

<p>What had been said to have been done in <i>India</i> was said by the "<i>half
Jew</i>"<a name="FNanchor_277:1_1403" id="FNanchor_277:1_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_277:1_1403" class="fnanchor">[277:1]</a> writers of the Gospels to have been done in Palestine. The
change of names and places, with the mixing up of various sketches of
<i>Egyptian</i>, <i>Phenician</i>, <i>Greek</i> and <i>Roman</i> mythology, was all that was
necessary. They had an abundance of material, and with it they built. A
long-continued habit of imposing upon others would in time subdue the
minds of the impostors themselves, and cause them to become at length

A <i>Grecian</i> festival called <span class="allcapsc">THYIA</span> was observed by the Eleans <i>in honor
of Bacchus</i>. The priests conveyed three empty vessels into a chapel, in
the presence of a large assembly, after which the doors were shut and
<i>sealed</i>. "On the morrow the company returned, and after every man had
looked upon his own seal, and seen that it was unbroken, the doors being
opened, the vessels were found full of wine." The god himself is said to
have appeared in person and filled the vessels. (Bell's Pantheon.)</p></div>

"There were numerous oracles of &AElig;sculapius, but the most celebrated one
was at Epidaurus. Here the sick sought responses and the recovery of
their health by sleeping in the temple.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The worship of &AElig;sculapius was

the temple Epidaurus to entreat the aid of the god." (Bulfinch: The Age

Gibbon, the historian, says of him: "Apollonius of Tyana, born about the
same time as Jesus Christ. His life (that of the former) is related in
so fabulous a manner by his disciples, that we are at a loss to discover
whether he was a sage, an impostor, or a fanatic." (Gibbon's Rome, vol.
i. p. 353, <i>note</i>.) What this learned historian says of Apollonius
applies to Jesus of Nazareth. <i>His</i> disciples have related his life in
so fabulous a manner, that some consider him to have been an impostor,
others a fanatic, others a sage, and others a <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<h3>CHRIST CRISHNA AND CHRIST JESUS COMPARED.</h3>

<p>Believing and affirming, that the <i>mythological portion</i> of the history
of Jesus of Nazareth, contained in the books forming the Canon of the
New Testament, is nothing more or less than a copy of the mythological
histories of the Hindoo Saviour <i>Crishna</i>, and the Buddhist Saviour
<i>Buddha</i>,<a name="FNanchor_278:1_1404" id="FNanchor_278:1_1404"></a><a href="#Footnote_278:1_1404" class="fnanchor">[278:1]</a> with a mixture of mythology borrowed from the Persians
and other nations, we shall in this and the chapter following, compare
the histories of these <i>Christs</i>, side by side with that of Christ
Jesus, the Christian Saviour.</p>

<p>In comparing the history of Crishna with that of Jesus, we have the
following remarkable parallels:</p>

<p>Many other remarkable passages might be adduced from the Bhagavad-gita,
the following of which may be noted:<a name="FNanchor_284:17_1502" id="FNanchor_284:17_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_284:17_1502" class="fnanchor">[284:17]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"He who has brought his members under subjection, but sits
with foolish minds thinking in his heart of sensual things, is
called a hypocrite." (Compare Matt. v. 28.)</p>

<p>"Many are my births that are past; many are thine too, O
Arjuna. I know them all, but thou knowest them not." (Comp.
John, viii. 14.)</p>

<p>"For the establishment of righteousness am I born from time to
time." (Comp. John, xviii. 37; I. John, iii. 3.)</p>

<p>"I am dearer to the wise than all possessions, and he is
dearer to me." (Comp. Luke, xiv. 33; John, xiv. 21.)</p>

<p>"The ignorant, the unbeliever, and he of a doubting mind
perish utterly." (Comp. Mark, xvi. 16.)</p>

<p>"Deluded men despise me when I take human form." (Comp. John,
i. 10.)</p></div>

<p>Crishna had the titles of "Saviour," "Redeemer," "Preserver,"
"Comforter," "Mediator," &amp;c. He was called "The Resurrection and the
Life," "The Lord of Lords," "The Great God," "The Holy One," "The Good
Shepherd," &amp;c. All of which are titles applied to Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Justice, humanity, good faith, compassion, disinterestedness, in fact,
all the virtues, are said<a name="FNanchor_285:1_1503" id="FNanchor_285:1_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_285:1_1503" class="fnanchor">[285:1]</a> to have been taught by Crishna, both by
precept and example.</p>

<p>The Christian missionary Georgius, who found the worship of the
crucified God in India, consoles himself by saying: "That which P.
Cassianus Maceratentis had told me before, I find to have been observed
more fully in French by the Living De Guignes, a most learned man; <i>i.
e.</i>, that <i>Crishna</i> is the very name corrupted of Christ the
Saviour."<a name="FNanchor_285:2_1504" id="FNanchor_285:2_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_285:2_1504" class="fnanchor">[285:2]</a> Many others have since made a similar statement, but
unfortunately for them, the name <i>Crishna</i> has nothing whatever to do
with "Christ the Saviour." It is a purely Sanscrit word, and means "<i>the
dark god</i>" or "<i>the black god</i>."<a name="FNanchor_285:3_1505" id="FNanchor_285:3_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_285:3_1505" class="fnanchor">[285:3]</a> The word <i>Christ</i> (which is not
a name, but a title), as we have already seen, is a Greek word, and
means "the Anointed," or "the Messiah." The fact is, the history of
Christ Crishna is older than that of Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Statues of Crishna are to be found in the very oldest cave temples
throughout India, and it has been satisfactorily proved, on the
authority of a passage of <i>Arrian</i>, that the <i>worship</i> of Crishna was
practiced in the time of Alexander the Great at what still remains one
of the most famous temples of India, the temple of Mathura, on the Jumna
river,<a name="FNanchor_285:4_1506" id="FNanchor_285:4_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_285:4_1506" class="fnanchor">[285:4]</a> which shows that he was considered a <i>god</i> at <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>that
time.<a name="FNanchor_286:1_1507" id="FNanchor_286:1_1507"></a><a href="#Footnote_286:1_1507" class="fnanchor">[286:1]</a> We have already seen that, according to Prof. Monier
Williams, he was <i>deified</i> about the fourth century <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span></p>

<p>Rev. J. P. Lundy says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If we may believe so good an authority as Edward Moor (author
of Moor's "Hindu Pantheon," and "Oriental Fragments"), both
the name of Crishna, and the general outline of his history,
were long anterior to the birth of our Saviour, <i>as very
certain things</i>, and probably extended to the time of Homer,
nearly nine hundred years before Christ, or more than a
hundred years before Isaiah lived and prophesied."<a name="FNanchor_286:2_1508" id="FNanchor_286:2_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_286:2_1508" class="fnanchor">[286:2]</a></p></div>

<p>In the Sanscrit Dictionary, compiled more than two thousand years ago,
we have the whole story of Crishna, the incarnate deity, born of a
virgin, and miraculously escaping in his infancy from Kansa, the
reigning monarch of the country.<a name="FNanchor_286:3_1509" id="FNanchor_286:3_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_286:3_1509" class="fnanchor">[286:3]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. J. B. S. Carwithen, known as one of the "Brampton Lecturers,"
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Both the name of Crishna and the general outline of his story
are long anterior to the birth of our Saviour; and this we
know, <i>not on the presumed antiquity of the Hindoo records
alone</i>. Both Arrian and Strabo assert that the god Crishna was
anciently worshiped at Mathura, on the river Jumna, where he
is worshiped at this day. But the emblems and attributes
essential to this deity are also transplanted into the
mythology of the West."<a name="FNanchor_286:4_1510" id="FNanchor_286:4_1510"></a><a href="#Footnote_286:4_1510" class="fnanchor">[286:4]</a></p></div>

<p>On the walls of the most ancient Hindoo temples, are sculptured
representations of the flight of Vasudeva and the infant Saviour
Crishna, from King Kansa, who sought to destroy him. The story of the
slaughtered infants is also the subject of an immense sculpture in the
cave temple of Elephanta. A person with a drawn sword is represented
surrounded by slaughtered infant boys, while men and women are
supplicating for their children. The date of this sculpture is lost in
the most remote antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_286:5_1511" id="FNanchor_286:5_1511"></a><a href="#Footnote_286:5_1511" class="fnanchor">[286:5]</a></p>

<p>The <i>flat roof</i> of this cavern-temple, and that of Ellora, and every
other circumstance connected with them, prove that their origin must be
referred to a very remote epoch. The <i>ancient</i> temples can easily be
distinguished from the more modern ones&mdash;such as those of Solsette&mdash;by
the shape of the roof. The ancient are flat, while the more modern are
arched.<a name="FNanchor_286:6_1512" id="FNanchor_286:6_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_286:6_1512" class="fnanchor">[286:6]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p><p>The <i>Bhagavad gita</i>, which contains so many sentiments akin to
Christianity, and which was not written until about the first or second
century,<a name="FNanchor_287:1_1513" id="FNanchor_287:1_1513"></a><a href="#Footnote_287:1_1513" class="fnanchor">[287:1]</a> has led many <i>Christian</i> scholars to believe, and
attempt to prove, that they have been borrowed from the New Testament,
but unfortunately for them, their premises are untenable. Prof. Monier
Williams, <i>the</i> accepted authority on Hindooism, and a thorough
Christian, writing for the "Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge,"
knowing that he could not very well overlook this subject in speaking of
the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To any one who has followed me in tracing the outline of this
remarkable philosophical dialogue, and has noted the numerous
parallels it offers to passages in <i>our</i> Sacred Scriptures, it
may seem strange that I hesitate to concur to any theory which
explains these coincidences by supposing that the author had
access to the New Testament, or that he derived some of his
ideas from the first propagaters of Christianity. Surely it
will be conceded that the probability of contact and
interaction between Gentile systems and the Christian religion
of the first two centuries of our era must have been greater
in Italy than in India. Yet, if we take the writings and
sayings of those great Roman philosophers, Seneca, Epictetus,
and Marcus Aurelius, we shall find them full of resemblances
to passages in our Scriptures, while their appears to be no
ground whatever for supposing that these eminent Pagan writers
and thinkers derived any of their ideas from either Jewish or
Christian sources. In fact, the Rev. F. W. Farrar, in his
interesting and valuable work 'Seekers after God,' has clearly
shown that 'to say that Pagan morality kindled its faded taper
at the Gospel light, whether furtively or unconsciously, that
it dissembled the obligation and made a boast of the splendor,
as if it were originally her own, is to make an assertion
wholly untenable.' He points out that the attempts of the
Christian Fathers to make out Pythagoras a debtor to Hebraic
wisdom, Plato an 'Atticizing Moses,' <ins class="corr" title="original has Aristote">Aristotle</ins> a picker-up of
ethics from a Jew, Seneca a correspondent of St. Paul, were
due 'in some cases to ignorance, in some to a want of perfect
honesty in controversial dealing.'<a name="FNanchor_287:2_1514" id="FNanchor_287:2_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_287:2_1514" class="fnanchor">[287:2]</a></p>

<p>"<i>His arguments would be even more conclusive if applied to
the Bhagavad-gita</i>, the author of which was probably
contemporaneous with Seneca.<a name="FNanchor_287:3_1515" id="FNanchor_287:3_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_287:3_1515" class="fnanchor">[287:3]</a> It must, indeed, be
admitted that the flames of true light which emerge from the
mists of pantheism in the writings of Indian philosophers,
must spring from the same source of light as the Gospel
itself; but it may reasonably be questioned whether there
could have been any actual contact of the Hindoo systems with
Christianity without <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>a more satisfactory result in the
modification of pantheistic and anti-Christian ideas."<a name="FNanchor_288:1_1516" id="FNanchor_288:1_1516"></a><a href="#Footnote_288:1_1516" class="fnanchor">[288:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Again he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It should not be forgotten that although the nations of
Europe have changed their religions during the past eighteen
centuries, <i>the Hindu has not done so, except very partially</i>.
Islam converted a certain number by force of arms in the
eighth and following centuries, and Christian truth is at last
slowly creeping onwards and winning its way by its own
inherent energy in the nineteenth; <i>but the religious creeds,
rites, customs, and habits of thought of the Hindus generally,
have altered little since the days of Manu, five hundred years
<span class="stressed">b. c.</span></i>"<a name="FNanchor_288:2_1517" id="FNanchor_288:2_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_288:2_1517" class="fnanchor">[288:2]</a></p></div>

<p>These words are conclusive; comments, therefore, are unnecessary.</p>

<p>Geo. W. Cox, in his "Aryan Mythology," speaking on this subject says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is true that these myths have been crystallized around the
name of Crishna in ages subsequent to the period during which
the earliest <i>vedic</i> literature came into existence; <i>but the
myths themselves are found in this older literature associated
with other gods</i>, and not always only in germ. <i>There is no
more room for inferring foreign influence in the growth of any
of these myths than, as Bunsen rightly insists, there is room
for tracing Christian influence in the earlier epical
literature of the Teutonic tribes.</i> Practically the myths of
Crishna seems to have been fully developed in the days of
Megasthenes (fourth century <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>) who identifies him with the
Greek Hercules."<a name="FNanchor_288:3_1518" id="FNanchor_288:3_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_288:3_1518" class="fnanchor">[288:3]</a></p></div>

<p>It should be remembered, in connection with this, that Dr. Parkhurst and
others have considered <i>Hercules</i> a type of Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>In the ancient epics Crishna is made to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am Vishnu, Brahma, Indra, and the source as well as the
destruction of things, the creator and the annihilator of the
whole aggregate of existences. While all men live in
unrighteousness, I, the unfailing, build up the bulwark of
righteousness, as the ages pass away."<a name="FNanchor_288:4_1519" id="FNanchor_288:4_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_288:4_1519" class="fnanchor">[288:4]</a></p></div>

<p>These words are almost identical with what we find in the
<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>. In the <i>Maha-bharata</i>, Vishnu is associated or
identified with Crishna, just as he is in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> and
<i>Vishnu Purana</i>, showing, in the words of Prof. Williams, that: the
<i>Puranas</i>, although of a comparatively modern date, are nevertheless
composed of matter to be found in the two great epic poems the
<i>Ramayana</i> and the <i>Maha-bharata</i>.<a name="FNanchor_288:5_1520" id="FNanchor_288:5_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_288:5_1520" class="fnanchor">[288:5]</a></p>

<h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_278:1_1404" id="Footnote_278:1_1404"></a><a href="#FNanchor_278:1_1404"><span class="label">[278:1]</span></a> It is also very evident that the history of Crishna&mdash;or
that part of it at least which has a <i>religious aspect</i>&mdash;is taken from
that of Buddha. Crishna, in the ancient epic poems, is simply a great
hero, and it is not until about the fourth century <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, that he is
<i>deified</i> and declared to be an incarnation of Vishnu, or Vishnu himself
in human form. (See Monier Williams' Hinduism, pp. 102, 103.)</p>

<p>"If it be urged that the attribution to Crishna of qualities or powers
belonging to the other deities is a mere device by which his devotees
sought to supersede the more ancient gods, <i>the answer must be that
nothing is done in his case which has not been done in the case of
almost every other member of the great company of the gods</i>, and that
the systematic adoption of this method is itself conclusive proof of the
looseness and flexibility of the materials of which the cumbrous
mythology of the Hindu epic poems is composed." (Cox: Aryan Mythology,
vol. ii. p. 130.) These words apply very forcibly to the history of
Christ Jesus. He being attributed with qualities and powers belonging to
the deities of the heathen is a mere device by which <i>his</i> devotees
sought to supersede the more ancient gods.</p></div>

Prof. Monier Williams says: "The author was probably a Brahman and
nominally a Vishnava, but really a philosopher whose mind was cast in a
broad and comprehensive mould. He is supposed to have lived in India
during the first and second century of our era. Some consider that he
lived as late as the third century, and some place him even later, <i>but
with these I cannot agree</i>." (Indian Wisdom, p. 137.)</p></div>

in the writings of Roman philosophers may be compared, Prof. Williams
refers the reader to "Seekers after God," by the Rev. F. W. Farrar, and
Dr. Ramage's "Beautiful Thoughts." The same sentiments are to be found
in <i>Mann</i>, which, says Prof. Williams, "few will place later than the
fifth century <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>" The <i>Mahabhrata</i>, written many centuries <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>,

<p>Never were devotees of any creed or faith as fast bound in its thraldom
as are the disciples of Gautama Buddha. For nearly two thousand four
hundred years it has been the established religion of Burmah, Siam,
Laos, Pega, Cambodia, Thibet, Japan, Tartary, Ceylon and Loo-Choo, and
many neighboring islands, beside about two-thirds of China and a large
portion of Siberia; and at the present day no inconsiderable number of
the simple peasantry of Swedish Lapland are found among its firm
adherents.<a name="FNanchor_297:11_1630" id="FNanchor_297:11_1630"></a><a href="#Footnote_297:11_1630" class="fnanchor">[297:11]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span><ins class="corr" title="original has extraneous quotation mark">Well</ins> authenticated records establish indisputably the facts, that
together with a noble physique, superior mental endowments, and high
moral excellence, there were found in Buddha a purity of life, sanctity
of character, and simple integrity of purpose, that commended themselves
to all brought under his influence. Even at this distant day, one cannot
listen with tearless eyes to the touching details of his pure, earnest
life, and patient endurance under contradiction, often fierce
persecution for those he sought to benefit. Altogether he seems to have
been one of those remarkable examples, of genius and virtue occasionally
met with, unaccountably superior to the age and nation that produced
them.</p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that he ever arrogated to himself any
higher authority than that of a teacher of religion, but, <i>as in modern
factions</i>, there were readily found among his followers those who
carried his peculiar tenets much further than their founder. These, not
content with lauding during his life-time the noble deeds of their
teacher, exalted him, within a quarter of a century after his death, to
a place among their deities&mdash;worshiping as a God one they had known only
as a simple-hearted, earnest, truth-seeking philanthropist.<a name="FNanchor_298:1_1631" id="FNanchor_298:1_1631"></a><a href="#Footnote_298:1_1631" class="fnanchor">[298:1]</a></p>

<p>This worship was at first but the natural upgushing of the veneration
and love Gautama had inspired during his noble life, and his sorrowing
disciples, mourning over the desolation his death had occasioned, turned
for consolation to the theory that he still lived.</p>

<p>Those who had known him in life cherished his name as the very synonym
of all that was generous and good, and it required but a step to exalt
him to divine honors; and so it was that Gautama Buddha became a God,
and continues to be worshiped as such.</p>

<p>For more than forty years Gautama thus dwelt among his followers,
instructing them daily in the sacred law, and laying down <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>many rules
for their guidance when he should be no longer with them.<a name="FNanchor_299:1_1632" id="FNanchor_299:1_1632"></a><a href="#Footnote_299:1_1632" class="fnanchor">[299:1]</a></p>

<p>He lived in a style the most simple and unostentatious, bore
uncomplainingly the weariness and privations incident to the many long
journeys made for the propagation of the new faith; and performed
countless deeds of love and mercy.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins>When the time came for him to be perfected, he directed his followers
no longer to remain together, but to go out in companies, and proclaim
the doctrines he had taught them, found schools and monasteries, build
temples, and perform acts of charity, that they might 'obtain merit,'
and gain access to the blessed shade of Nigban, which he told them he
was about to enter, and where they believe he has now reposed more than
two thousand years."</p>

<p>To the pious Buddhist it seems irreverent to speak of Gautama by his
mere ordinary and human name, and he makes use therefore, of one of
those numerous epithets which are used only of the Buddha, "the
Enlightened One." Such are <i>Sakya-sinha</i>, "the Lion of the Tribe of
Sakya;" <i>Sakya-muni</i>, "the Sakya Sage;" <i>Sugata</i>, "the Happy One;"
<i>Sattha</i>, "the Teacher;" <i>Jina</i>, "the Conqueror;" <i>Bhagavad</i>, "the
Blessed One;" <i>Loka-natha</i>, "the Lord of the World;" <i>Sarvajna</i>, "the
Omniscient One;" <i>Dharma-raja</i>, "the King of Righteousness;" he is also
called "the Author of Happiness," "the Possessor of All," "the Supreme
Being," "the Eternal One," "the Dispeller of Pain and Trouble," "the
Guardian of the Universe," "the Emblem of Mercy," "the Saviour of the
World," "the Great Physician," "the God among Gods," "the Anointed" or
"the Christ," "the Messiah," "the Only-Begotten," "the Heaven-Descended
Mortal," "the Way of Life, and of Immortality," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_299:2_1633" id="FNanchor_299:2_1633"></a><a href="#Footnote_299:2_1633" class="fnanchor">[299:2]</a></p>

<p>At no time did Buddha receive his knowledge from a human <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>source, that
is, from flesh and blood. His source was the power of his divine wisdom,
the spiritual power of Maya, which he already possessed before his
incarnation. It was by this divine power, which is also called the "Holy
Ghost," that he became the Saviour, the Kung-teng, the Anointed or
Messiah, to whom prophecies had pointed. Buddha was regarded as the
supernatural light of the world; and this world to which he came was his
own, his possession, for he is styled: "The Lord of the World."<a name="FNanchor_300:1_1634" id="FNanchor_300:1_1634"></a><a href="#Footnote_300:1_1634" class="fnanchor">[300:1]</a></p>

ought to be extended to all, even to enemies; that men ought to love
truth and hate the lie; that good works ought not be done openly, but

<p>"Sakya-Muni healed the sick, performed miracles and taught his doctrines

by the recognized authorities, avoided strife, and illustrated his
doctrines by his life."<a name="FNanchor_300:4_1637" id="FNanchor_300:4_1637"></a><a href="#Footnote_300:4_1637" class="fnanchor">[300:4]</a></p>

<p>It is said that eighty thousand followers of Buddha went forth from
Hindostan, as missionaries to other lands; and the traditions of various
countries are full of legends concerning their benevolence, holiness,
and miraculous power. His religion has never been propagated by the
sword. It has been effected entirely by the influence of peaceable and
persevering devotees.<a name="FNanchor_300:5_1638" id="FNanchor_300:5_1638"></a><a href="#Footnote_300:5_1638" class="fnanchor">[300:5]</a> The era of the Siamese is the death of
Buddha. In Ceylon, they date from the introduction of his religion into
their island. It is supposed to be more extensively adopted than any
religion that ever existed. Its votaries are computed at four hundred
millions; more than one-third of the whole human race.<a name="FNanchor_300:6_1639" id="FNanchor_300:6_1639"></a><a href="#Footnote_300:6_1639" class="fnanchor">[300:6]</a></p>

<p>There is much contradiction among writers concerning the <i>date</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>of the
Buddhist religion. This confusion arises from the fact that there are
several Buddhas,<a name="FNanchor_301:1_1640" id="FNanchor_301:1_1640"></a><a href="#Footnote_301:1_1640" class="fnanchor">[301:1]</a> objects of worship; because the word is not a
name, but a title, signifying an extraordinary degree of holiness. Those
who have examined the subject most deeply have generally agreed that
Buddha Sakai, from whom the religion takes its name, must have been a
real, historical personage, who appeared many centuries before the time
assigned for the birth of Christ Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_301:2_1641" id="FNanchor_301:2_1641"></a><a href="#Footnote_301:2_1641" class="fnanchor">[301:2]</a> There are many things to
confirm this supposition. In some portions of India, his religion
appears to have flourished for a long time side by side with that of the
Brahmans. This is shown by the existence of many ancient temples, some
of them cut in subterranean rock, with an immensity of labor, which it
must have required a long period to accomplish. In those old temples,
his statues represent him with hair knotted all over his head, which was
a very ancient custom with the anchorites of Hindostan, before the
practice of shaving the <ins class="corr" title="original has dead">head</ins> was introduced among their devotees.<a name="FNanchor_301:3_1642" id="FNanchor_301:3_1642"></a><a href="#Footnote_301:3_1642" class="fnanchor">[301:3]</a>
His religion is also mentioned in one of the very ancient epic poems of
India. The severity of the persecution indicates that their numbers and
influence had became formidable to the Brahmans, who had everything to
fear from a sect which abolished hereditary priesthood, and allowed the
holy of all castes to become teachers.<a name="FNanchor_301:4_1643" id="FNanchor_301:4_1643"></a><a href="#Footnote_301:4_1643" class="fnanchor">[301:4]</a></p>

<p>It may be observed that in speaking of the pre-existence of Buddha in
heaven&mdash;his birth of a virgin&mdash;the songs of the angels at his birth&mdash;his
recognition as a divine child&mdash;his disputation with the doctors&mdash;his
temptation in the wilderness&mdash;his transfiguration on the Mount&mdash;his life
of preaching and working miracles&mdash;and finally, his ascension into
heaven, we referred to Prof. Samuel Beal's "History of Buddha," as one
of our authorities. This work is simply a translation of the
"<i>Fo-pen-hing</i>," made by Professor Beal from a Chinese copy, in the
"Indian Office Library."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p><p>Now, in regard to the antiquity of this work, we will quote the words
of the translator in speaking on this subject.</p>

<p>First, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins><i>We know</i> that the <i>Fo-pen-hing</i> was translated into Chinese
from <i>Sanscrit</i> (the ancient language of <i>Hindostan</i>) so early
as the eleventh year of the reign of Wing-ping (Ming-ti), of
the Han dynasty, <i>i. e.</i>, 69 or 70 <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> <i>We may, therefore,
safely suppose that the original work was in circulation in
India for some time previous to this date.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_302:1_1644" id="FNanchor_302:1_1644"></a><a href="#Footnote_302:1_1644" class="fnanchor">[302:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Again, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There can be no doubt that the present work (<i>i. e.</i> the
Fo-pen-hing, or Hist. of Buddha) contains as a woof (so to
speak) some of the earliest verses (G&acirc;thas) in which the
History of Buddha was sung, <i>long before the work itself was
penned</i>.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins>These G&acirc;thas were evidently composed in different Prakrit
forms (during a period of disintegration) <i>before the more
modern type of Sanscrit</i> was fixed by the rules of Panini, and
the popular epics of the M&acirc;habharata and the Ram&acirc;yana."<a name="FNanchor_302:2_1645" id="FNanchor_302:2_1645"></a><a href="#Footnote_302:2_1645" class="fnanchor">[302:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Again, in speaking of the points of resemblance in the history of Buddha
and Jesus, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"These points of agreement with the Gospel narrative naturally
arouse curiosity <i>and require explanation</i>. If we could prove
that they (the legends related of Buddha) were unknown in the
East for some centuries <i>after</i> Christ, the explanation would
be easy. <i>But all the evidence we have goes to prove the
contrary.</i></p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins>It would be a natural inference that many of the events in
the legend of Buddha were borrowed from the Apocryphal
Gospels, if we were quite certain that these Apocryphal
Gospels had not borrowed from it. How then may we explain the
matter? It would be better at once to say that in our present
state of knowledge there is no complete explanation to
offer."<a name="FNanchor_302:3_1646" id="FNanchor_302:3_1646"></a><a href="#Footnote_302:3_1646" class="fnanchor">[302:3]</a></p></div>

<p>There certainly is no "complete explanation" to be offered by one who
attempts to uphold the historical accuracy of the New Testament. The
"Devil" and "Type" theories having vanished, like all theories built on
sand, nothing now remains for the honest man to do but acknowledge the
truth, which is, <i>that the history of Jesus of Nazareth as related in
the books of the New Testament, is simply a copy of that of Buddha, with
a mixture of mythology borrowed from other nations</i>. Ernest de Bunsen
almost acknowledges this when he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"With the remarkable exception of the death of Jesus on the
cross, and of the doctrine of atonement by vicarious
suffering, which is absolutely excluded by Buddhism, the <i>most
ancient</i> of the Buddhistic records known to us contain
statements about the life and the doctrines of Gautama Buddha
which correspond in a remarkable manner, <i>and impossibly by
mere chance</i>, with the traditions recorded in the Gospels
about the life and doctrines of Jesus Christ. It is still more
strange that these Buddhistic legends about Gautama <i>as the
Angel-Messiah</i> refer to a doctrine which we find only in the
Epistles of Paul and in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>fourth Gospel. This can be
explained by the assumption of a common source of revelation;
but then the serious question must be considered, why the
doctrine of the Angel-Messiah, supposing it to have been
revealed, and which we find in the East and in the West, is
not contained in any of the Scriptures of the Old Testament
which can possibly have been written before the Babylonian
Captivity, nor in the first three Gospels. <i>Can the systematic
keeping-back of essential truth be attributed to God or to
man?</i>"<a name="FNanchor_303:1_1647" id="FNanchor_303:1_1647"></a><a href="#Footnote_303:1_1647" class="fnanchor">[303:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Beside the work referred to above as being translated by Prof. Beal,
there is another copy originally composed in verse. This was translated
by the learned Fonceau, who gives it an antiquity of <i>two thousand
years</i>, "although the original treatise must be attributed to an earlier
date."<a name="FNanchor_303:2_1648" id="FNanchor_303:2_1648"></a><a href="#Footnote_303:2_1648" class="fnanchor">[303:2]</a></p>

<p>In regard to the teachings of Buddha, which correspond so strikingly
with those of Jesus, Prof. Rhys Davids, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"With regard to Gautama's teaching we have more reliable
authority than we have with regard to his life. It is true
that none of the books of the Three Pitakas can at present be
satisfactorily traced back before the Council of Asoka, held
at Patna, about 250 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, that is to say, at least one
hundred and thirty years after the death of the teacher; but
they undoubtedly contain a great deal of much older
matter."<a name="FNanchor_303:3_1649" id="FNanchor_303:3_1649"></a><a href="#Footnote_303:3_1649" class="fnanchor">[303:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Prof. Max M&uuml;ller says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Between the language of Buddha and his disciples, and the
language of Christ and his apostles, there are strange
coincidences. Even some of the Buddhist legends and parables
sound as if taken from the New Testament; <i>though we know that
many of them existed before the beginning of the Christian
Era</i>."<a name="FNanchor_303:4_1650" id="FNanchor_303:4_1650"></a><a href="#Footnote_303:4_1650" class="fnanchor">[303:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Just as many of the myths related of the Hindoo Saviour Crishna were
<i>previously current</i> regarding some of the Vedic gods, so likewise, many
of the myths <i>previously current</i> regarding the god <i>Sumana</i>, worshiped
both on Adam's peak, and at the cave of Dambulla, <i>were added to the
Buddha myth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_303:5_1651" id="FNanchor_303:5_1651"></a><a href="#Footnote_303:5_1651" class="fnanchor">[303:5]</a> Much of the legend which was transferred to the
Buddha, had previously existed, and had clustered around the idea of a
<i><ins class="corr" title="original has Chakrawarti">Chakrawarti</ins></i>.<a name="FNanchor_303:6_1652" id="FNanchor_303:6_1652"></a><a href="#Footnote_303:6_1652" class="fnanchor">[303:6]</a> Thus we see that the legend of <i>Christ</i> Buddha, as
with the legend of <i>Christ</i> Jesus, <i>existed before his time</i>.<a name="FNanchor_303:7_1653" id="FNanchor_303:7_1653"></a><a href="#Footnote_303:7_1653" class="fnanchor">[303:7]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p><p>We have established the fact then&mdash;<i>and no man can produce better
authorities</i>&mdash;that Buddha and Buddhism, which correspond in such a
remarkable manner with Jesus and Christianity, were long anterior to the
Christian era. Now, as Ernest de Bunsen says, this remarkable similarity
in the histories of the founders and their religion, could not possibly
happen by chance.</p>

<p>Whenever two religious or legendary histories of mythological personages
resemble each other so completely as do the histories and teachings of
Buddha and Jesus, the older must be the parent, and the younger the
child. We must therefore conclude that, since the history of Buddha and
Buddhism is very much older than that of Jesus and Christianity, the
Christians are incontestably <i>either sectarians or plagiarists of the
religion of the Buddhists</i>.</p>

incarnation of Vishnu, although he preached against the doctrines of the

owning to the desire of the Brahmans to effect a compromise with
Buddhism. (See Williams' Hinduism, pp. 82 and 108.)</p>

sometimes a god, or rather both one and the other, a divine incarnation,
a man-god; who came into the world to enlighten men, to redeem them, and
to indicate to them the way of safety. This idea of redemption by a
divine incarnation is so general and popular among the Buddhists, that
during our travels in Upper Asia, we everywhere found it expressed in a
neat formula. If we addressed to a Mongol or Thibetan the question, 'Who
is Buddha?' he would immediately reply, 'The Saviour of Men.'" (M.
L'Abb&eacute; Huc: Travels, vol. i. p. 326.)</p>

<p>"The miraculous birth of Buddha, his life and instructions, contain a
great number of the moral and dogmatic truths professed in
Christianity." (Ibid. p. 327.)</p>

<p>"He in mercy left paradise, and came down to earth because he was filled
with compassion for the sins and misery of mankind. He sought to lead
them into better paths, and took their sufferings upon himself, that he
might expiate their crimes, and mitigate the punishment they must
otherwise inevitably undergo." (L. Maria Child.)</p></div>

her hands clasped in prayer, and the naked body of the child in the same
attitude appears upon her stomach, apparently supposed to be seen
through the garments and body of the mother. M. Drydon saw at Lyons a
Salutation painted on shutters, in which the two infants (Jesus and
John) likewise depicted on their mothers' stomachs, were also saluting
each other. This precisely corresponds to Buddhist accounts of the
Boddhisattvas ante-natal proceedings." (Viscount Amberly: Analysis of
Relig. Belief, p. 224, <i>note</i>.)</p></div>

<p>This was a common myth. For instance: A Brahman called <i>Dashthaka</i>, a
"<i>heaven descended mortal</i>," after his birth, <i>without any human
instruction whatever</i>, was able thoroughly to explain the four <i>Vedas</i>,
the collective body of the sacred writings of the Hindoos, which were
considered as directly revealed by Brahma. (See Beal's Hist. Buddha, p.
48.)</p>

<p><i>Confucius</i>, the miraculous-born Chinese sage, was a wonderful child. At
the age of seven he went to a public school, the superior of which was a
person of eminent wisdom and piety. The faculty with which Confucius
imbibed the lessons of his master, the ascendency which he acquired
amongst his fellow pupils, and the superiority of his genius and
capacity, raised universal admiration. He appeared to acquire knowledge
<i>intuitively</i>, and his mother found it superfluous to teach him what
"heaven had already engraven upon his heart." (See Thornton's Hist.
China, vol. i. p. 153.)</p></div>

of <i>her</i>, one of a nation with whom the Jews had no dealings, so this
young Matangi warned Ananda of her caste, which rendered it unlawful for
her to approach a monk. And as Jesus continued, nevertheless, to
converse with the woman, so Ananda did not shrink from this outcast
damsel. And as the disciples "marvelled" that Jesus should have

sermon was summed up in the celebrated verse:</p>

<p>"Gautama Buddha is said to have announced to his disciples that the time
of his departure had come: 'Arise, let us go hence, my time is come.'
Turned toward the East and with folded arms he prayed to the highest
spirit who inhabits the region of purest light, to Maha-Brahma, to the
king in heaven, to Devaraja, who from his throne looked down on Gautama,
and appeared to him in a self-chosen personality." (Bunsen: The
Angel-Messiah. Compare with Matt. xxvi. 36-47.)</p></div>

<p>Buddha at one time said to his disciples: "Go ye now, and preach the
most excellent law, expounding every point thereof, and unfolding it
with care and attention in all its bearings and particulars. Explain the
beginning, the middle, and the end of the law, to all men without
exception; let everything respecting it be made publicly known and
brought to the broad daylight." (Rhys David's Buddhism, p. 55, 56.)</p>

<p>When Buddha, just before his death, took his last formal farewell of his
assembled followers, he said unto them: "Oh mendicants, thoroughly
learn, and practice, and perfect, and spread abroad the law thought out
and revealed by me, in order that this religion of mine may last long,
and be perpetuated for the good and happiness of the great multitudes,
out of pity for the world, to the advantage and prosperity of gods and
men." (Ibid. p. 172.)</p></div>

<p>This celebrated city of Benares, which has a population of 200,000, out
of which at least 25,000 are Brahmans, was probably one of the first to
acquire a fame for sanctity, and it has always maintained its reputation
as the most sacred spot in all India. Here, in this fortress of
Hindooism, Brahmanism displays itself in all its plentitude and power.
Here the degrading effect of idolatry is visibly demonstrated as it is
nowhere else except in the extreme south of India. Here, temples, idols,
and symbols, sacred wells, springs, and pools, are multiplied beyond all
calculation. Here every particle of ground is believed to be hallowed,
and the very air holy. The number of temples is at least two thousand,
not counting innumerable smaller shrines. In the principal temple of
Siva, called Visvesvara, are collected in one spot several thousand
idols and symbols, the whole number scattered throughout the city,
being, it is thought, at least half a million.</p>

<p>Benares, indeed, must always be regarded as the Hindoo's Jerusalem. The
desire of a pious man's life is to accomplish at least one pilgrimage to
what he regards as a portion of heaven let down upon earth; and if he
can die within the holy circuit of the Pancakosi stretching with a
radius of ten miles around the city&mdash;nay, if any human being die there,
be he Asiatic or European&mdash;no previously incurred guilt, however
heinous, can prevent his attainment of celestial bliss.</p></div>

<p>On one occasion Buddha preached a sermon on the five senses and the
heart (which he regarded as a sixth organ of sense), which pertained to
guarding against the passion of lust. Rhys Davids, who, in speaking of
this sermon, says: "One may pause and wonder at finding such a sermon
preached so early in the history of the world&mdash;more than 400 years
before the rise of Christianity&mdash;and among a people who have long been
thought peculiarly idolatrous and sensual." (Buddhism, p. 60.)</p></div>

<p><i>Bacchus</i> rode in a triumphal procession, on approaching the city of
<i>Thebes</i>. "Pantheus, the king, who had no respect for the new worship
(instituted by Bacchus) forbade its rites to be performed. But when it
was known that Bacchus was advancing, men and women, but chiefly the
latter, young and old, poured forth to meet him and to join his
triumphal march.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was in vain Pantheus remonstrated, commanded and
threatened. 'Go,' said he to his attendants, 'seize this vagabond leader
of the rout and bring him to me. I will soon make him confess his false
claim of heavenly parentage and renounce his counterfeit worship.'"

stand forth as saliently as Gotama Buddha, in the annals of the East. In
little more than two centuries from his decease the system he
established had spread throughout the whole of India, overcoming
opposition the most formidable, and binding together the most discordant
elements; and at the present moment Buddhism is the prevailing religion,
under various modifications, of Tibet, Nepal, Siam, Burma, Japan, and
South Ceylon; and in China it has a position of at least equal
prominence with its two great rivals, Confucianism and Taouism. A long
time its influence extended throughout nearly three-fourths of Asia;
from the steppes of Tartary to the palm groves of Ceylon, and from the
vale of Cashmere to the isles of Japan." (R. Spence Hardy: Buddhist Leg.

absolutely sinless. His perfect wisdom is declared by the ancient
epithet of <i>Samma-sambuddha</i>, 'the Completely Enlightened One;' found at
the commencement of every Pali text; and at the present day, in Ceylon,
the usual way in which Gautama is styled is <i>Sarwajnan-wahanse</i>,' the
Venerable Omniscient One.' From his perfect wisdom, according to
Buddhist belief, <i>his sinlessness would follow as a matter of course</i>.
He was the first and the greatest of the Arahats. <i>As a consequence of
this doctrine</i> the belief soon sprang up that he could not have been,
that he was not, born as ordinary men are; that he had no earthly
father; that he descended of his own accord into his mother's womb from
his throne in heaven; and that he gave unmistakable signs, immediately
after his birth of his high character and of his future greatness."

the Buddhists believe that he composed works which his immediate
disciples learned by heart in his life-time, and which were handed down
by memory in their original state until they were committed to writing.
This is not impossible: it is known that the <i>Vedas</i> were handed down in
this manner for many hundreds of years, and none would now dispute the
enormous powers of memory to which Indian priests and monks attained,
when written books were not invented, or only used as helps to memory.
Even though they are well acquainted with writing, the monks in Ceylon
do not use books in their religions services, but, repeat, for instance,
the whole of the <i>Patimokkha</i> on Uposatha (Sabbath) days by heart. (See
Rhys Davids' Buddhism, pp. 9, 10.)</p></div>

<p>"It is surprising," says Rhys Davids, "that, like Romans worshiping
Augustus, or Greeks adding the glow of the sun-myth to the glory of
Alexander, the Indians should have formed an ideal of their Chakravarti,
and transferred to this new ideal many of the dimly sacred and half
understood traits of the Vedic heroes? Is it surprising that the
Buddhists should have found it edifying to recognize in <i>their</i> hero the
Chakravarti of Righteousness, and that the story of the Buddha should be
tinged with the coloring of these Chakravarti myths?" (Ibid. Buddhism,

sins."<a name="FNanchor_305:1_1654" id="FNanchor_305:1_1654"></a><a href="#Footnote_305:1_1654" class="fnanchor">[305:1]</a></p></div>

<p>According to Christian belief, Jesus <i>instituted</i> this
"<i>Sacrament</i>"<a name="FNanchor_305:2_1655" id="FNanchor_305:2_1655"></a><a href="#Footnote_305:2_1655" class="fnanchor">[305:2]</a>&mdash;as it is called&mdash;and it was observed by the
primitive Christians, as he had enjoined them; but we shall find that
this breaking of bread, and drinking of wine,&mdash;<i>supposed to be the body
and blood of a god</i><a name="FNanchor_305:3_1656" id="FNanchor_305:3_1656"></a><a href="#Footnote_305:3_1656" class="fnanchor">[305:3]</a>&mdash;is simply another piece of Paganism imbibed
by the Christians.</p>

<p>The <i>Eucharist</i> was instituted many hundreds of years before the time
assigned for the birth of Christ Jesus. Cicero, the greatest orator of
Rome, and one of the most illustrious of her statesmen, born in the year
106 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, mentions it in his works, and wonders at the strangeness of
the rite. "How can a man be so stupid," says he, "as to imagine that
which he eats to be a God?" There had been an esoteric meaning attached
to it from the first establishment of the <i>mysteries</i> among the Pagans,
and the Eucharistia is one of the oldest rites of antiquity.</p>

<p>The adherents of the Grand Lama in Thibet and Tartary offer to their god
a sacrament of <i>bread and wine</i>.<a name="FNanchor_305:4_1657" id="FNanchor_305:4_1657"></a><a href="#Footnote_305:4_1657" class="fnanchor">[305:4]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p><p>P. Andrada La Crozius, a French missionary, and one of the first
Christians who went to Nepaul and Thibet, says in his "History of
India:"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Their Grand Lama celebrates a species of sacrifice with
<i>bread</i> and <i>wine</i>, in which, after taking a small quantity
himself, he distributes the rest among the Lamas present at
this ceremony."<a name="FNanchor_306:1_1658" id="FNanchor_306:1_1658"></a><a href="#Footnote_306:1_1658" class="fnanchor">[306:1]</a></p></div>

<p>In certain rites both in the <i>Indian</i> and the <i>Parsee</i> religions, the
devotees drink the juice of the Soma, or <i>Haoma</i> plant. They consider it
a <i>god</i> as well as a plant, just as the wine of the Christian sacrament
is considered both the juice of the grape, and the blood of the
Redeemer.<a name="FNanchor_306:2_1659" id="FNanchor_306:2_1659"></a><a href="#Footnote_306:2_1659" class="fnanchor">[306:2]</a> Says Mr. Baring-Gould:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Among the ancient Hindoos, <i>Soma</i> was a chief deity; he is
called 'the Giver of Life and of health,' the 'Protector,' he
who is 'the Guide to Immortality.' He became incarnate among
men, was taken by them and slain, and brayed in a mortar. But
he rose in flame to heaven, to be the 'Benefactor of the
World,' and the 'Mediator between God and Man.' Through
communion with him in his sacrifice, man, (who partook of this
god), has an assurance of immortality, for by that <i>sacrament</i>
he obtains union with his divinity."<a name="FNanchor_306:3_1660" id="FNanchor_306:3_1660"></a><a href="#Footnote_306:3_1660" class="fnanchor">[306:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The ancient <i>Egyptians</i>&mdash;as we have seen&mdash;annually celebrated the
<i>Resurrection</i> of their God and Saviour <i>Osiris</i>, at which time they
commemorated his death by the <i>Eucharist</i>, eating the sacred cake, or
wafer, <i>after it had been consecrated by the priest, and become
veritable flesh of his flesh</i>.<a name="FNanchor_306:4_1661" id="FNanchor_306:4_1661"></a><a href="#Footnote_306:4_1661" class="fnanchor">[306:4]</a> The bread, after sacerdotal rites,
became mystically the body of <i>Osiris</i>, and, in such a manner, <i>they ate
their god</i>.<a name="FNanchor_306:5_1662" id="FNanchor_306:5_1662"></a><a href="#Footnote_306:5_1662" class="fnanchor">[306:5]</a> Bread and wine were brought to the temples by the
worshipers, as offerings.<a name="FNanchor_306:6_1663" id="FNanchor_306:6_1663"></a><a href="#Footnote_306:6_1663" class="fnanchor">[306:6]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Therapeutes</i> or <i>Essenes</i>, whom we believe to be of Buddhist
origin, and who lived in large numbers in Egypt, also had the ceremony
of the sacrament among them.<a name="FNanchor_306:7_1664" id="FNanchor_306:7_1664"></a><a href="#Footnote_306:7_1664" class="fnanchor">[306:7]</a> Most of them, however, being
temperate, substituted water for wine, while others drank a mixture of
water and wine.</p>

<p>Pythagoras, the celebrated Grecian philosopher, who was born about the
year 570 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, performed this ceremony of the <i>sacrament</i>.<a name="FNanchor_306:8_1665" id="FNanchor_306:8_1665"></a><a href="#Footnote_306:8_1665" class="fnanchor">[306:8]</a> He is
supposed to have visited Egypt, and there availed himself of all such
mysterious lore as the priests could be induced to impart. He and his
followers practiced asceticism, and peculiarities of diet and clothing,
similar to the Essenes, which has led some scholars to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>believe that he
instituted the order, but this is evidently not the case.</p>

<p>The Kenite "King of Righteousness," <i>Melchizedek</i>, "a priest of the Most
High God," brought out <span class="allcapsc">BREAD</span> <i>and</i> <span class="allcapsc">WINE</span> as a <i>sign</i> or <i>symbol</i> of
worship; as <i>the mystic elements of Divine presence</i>. In the visible
symbol of <i>bread and wine</i> they worshiped <i>the invisible presence of the
Creator of heaven and earth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_307:1_1666" id="FNanchor_307:1_1666"></a><a href="#Footnote_307:1_1666" class="fnanchor">[307:1]</a></p>

<p>To account for this, Christian divines have been much puzzled. The Rev.
Dr. Milner says, in speaking of this passage:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was in offering up a sacrifice of bread and wine, instead
of slaughtered animals, that Melchizedek's sacrifice differed
from the generality of those in the old law, and that he
<i>prefigured</i> the sacrifice which Christ was to <i>institute</i> in
the new law from the same elements. No other sense than this
can be elicited from the Scripture as to this matter; and
accordingly the holy fathers unanimously adhere to this
meaning."<a name="FNanchor_307:2_1667" id="FNanchor_307:2_1667"></a><a href="#Footnote_307:2_1667" class="fnanchor">[307:2]</a></p></div>

<p>This style of reasoning is in accord with the <span class="allcapsc">TYPE</span> theory concerning the
Virgin-born, Crucified and Resurrected Saviours, but it is not
altogether satisfactory. If it had been said that the religion of
Melchizedek, and the religion of the Persians, were the <i>same</i>, there
would be no difficulty in explaining the passage.</p>

<p>Not only were bread and wine brought forth by Melchizedek when he
blessed Abraham, but it was offered to God and eaten before him by
Jethro and the elders of Israel, and some, at least, of the <i>mourning</i>
Israelites broke bread and drank "the cup of consolation," in
remembrance of the departed, "to comfort them for the dead."<a name="FNanchor_307:3_1668" id="FNanchor_307:3_1668"></a><a href="#Footnote_307:3_1668" class="fnanchor">[307:3]</a></p>

<p>It is in the ancient religion of Persia&mdash;the religion of Mithra, the
Mediator, the Redeemer and Saviour&mdash;that we find the nearest resemblance
to the sacrament of the Christians, and from which it was evidently
borrowed. Those who were initiated into the mysteries of Mithra, or
became <i>members</i>, took the sacrament of bread and wine.<a name="FNanchor_307:4_1669" id="FNanchor_307:4_1669"></a><a href="#Footnote_307:4_1669" class="fnanchor">[307:4]</a></p>

<p>M. Renan, speaking of <i>Mithraicism</i>, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It had its mysterious meetings: its chapels, which bore a
strong resemblance to little churches. It forged a very
lasting bond of brotherhood between its initiates: it had a
<i>Eucharist</i>, a Supper so like the Christian Mysteries, that
good Justin Martyr, the Apologist, can find only one
explanation of the apparent identity, namely, that Satan, in
order to deceive the human race, determined to imitate the
Christian ceremonies, and so stole them."<a name="FNanchor_307:5_1670" id="FNanchor_307:5_1670"></a><a href="#Footnote_307:5_1670" class="fnanchor">[307:5]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p><p>The words of St. Justin, wherein he alludes to this ceremony, are as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The apostles, in the commentaries written by themselves,
which we call Gospels, have delivered down to us how that
Jesus thus commanded them: He having taken bread, <i>after he
had given thanks</i>,<a name="FNanchor_308:1_1671" id="FNanchor_308:1_1671"></a><a href="#Footnote_308:1_1671" class="fnanchor">[308:1]</a> said, Do this in commemoration of
me; this is my body. And having taken a cup, and returned
thanks, he said: This is my blood, and delivered it to them
alone. Which thing indeed the evil spirits have taught to be
done out of mimicry in the Mysteries and Initiatory rites of
Mithra.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins>For you either know, or can know, that bread and a cup of
water (or wine) are given out, with certain incantations, in
the consecration of the person who is being initiated in the
Mysteries of Mithra."<a name="FNanchor_308:2_1672" id="FNanchor_308:2_1672"></a><a href="#Footnote_308:2_1672" class="fnanchor">[308:2]</a></p></div>

<p>This food they called the Eucharist, of which no one was allowed to
partake but the persons who believed that the things they taught were
true, and who had been washed with the washing that is for the remission
of sin.<a name="FNanchor_308:3_1673" id="FNanchor_308:3_1673"></a><a href="#Footnote_308:3_1673" class="fnanchor">[308:3]</a> Tertullian, who flourished from 193 to 220 <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span>, also
speaks of the Mithraic devotees celebrating the Eucharist.<a name="FNanchor_308:4_1674" id="FNanchor_308:4_1674"></a><a href="#Footnote_308:4_1674" class="fnanchor">[308:4]</a></p>

<p>The Eucharist of the Lord and Saviour, as the Magi called Mithra, the
second person in their Trinity, or their Eucharistic sacrifice, was
always made exactly and in every respect the same as that of the
orthodox Christians, for both sometimes used water instead of wine, or a
mixture of the two.<a name="FNanchor_308:5_1675" id="FNanchor_308:5_1675"></a><a href="#Footnote_308:5_1675" class="fnanchor">[308:5]</a></p>

<p>The Christian Fathers often liken their rites to those of the Therapeuts
(Essenes) and worshipers of Mithra. Here is Justin Martyr's account of
Christian initiation:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"But we, after we have thus washed him who has been convinced
and assented to our teachings, bring him to the place where
those who are called <i>brethren</i> are assembled, in order that
we may offer hearty prayers in common for ourselves and the
<i>illuminated</i> person. Having ended our prayers, we salute one
another with a kiss. There is then brought to the president of
the brethren <i>bread and a cup of wine mixed with water</i>. When
the president has given thanks, and all the people have
expressed their assent, those that are called by us <i>deacons</i>
give to each of those present to partake of the bread and wine
mixed with water."<a name="FNanchor_308:6_1676" id="FNanchor_308:6_1676"></a><a href="#Footnote_308:6_1676" class="fnanchor">[308:6]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p><p>In the service of Edward the Sixth of England, water is directed to be
mixed with the wine.<a name="FNanchor_309:1_1677" id="FNanchor_309:1_1677"></a><a href="#Footnote_309:1_1677" class="fnanchor">[309:1]</a> This is a union of the two; not a half
measure, but a double one. If it be correct to take it with wine, then
they were right; if with water, they still were right; as they took
both, they could not be wrong.</p>

<p>The <i>bread</i>, used in these Pagan Mysteries, was carried in <i>baskets</i>,
which practice was also adopted by the Christians. St. Jerome, speaking
of it, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Nothing can be richer than one who carries <i>the body of
Christ</i> (viz.: <i>the bread</i>) in a basket made of twigs."<a name="FNanchor_309:2_1678" id="FNanchor_309:2_1678"></a><a href="#Footnote_309:2_1678" class="fnanchor">[309:2]</a></p></div>

<p>The Persian Magi introduced the worship of Mithra into Rome, and his
mysteries were solemnized in a <i>cave</i>. In the process of initiation
there, candidates were also administered the sacrament of <i>bread and
wine</i>, and were marked on the forehead with the sign of the
cross.<a name="FNanchor_309:3_1679" id="FNanchor_309:3_1679"></a><a href="#Footnote_309:3_1679" class="fnanchor">[309:3]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Greeks</i> also had their "<i>Mysteries</i>," wherein they
celebrated the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. The Rev. Robert Taylor,
speaking of this, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>Eleusinian</i> Mysteries, or, Sacrament of the Lord's
Supper, was the most august of all the Pagan ceremonies
celebrated, more especially by the Athenians, every fifth
year,<a name="FNanchor_309:4_1680" id="FNanchor_309:4_1680"></a><a href="#Footnote_309:4_1680" class="fnanchor">[309:4]</a> in honor of <i>Ceres</i>, the goddess of corn, who, in
allegorical language, <i>had given us her flesh to eat</i>; as
<i>Bacchus</i>, the god of wine, in like sense, <i>had given us his
blood to drink</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"From these ceremonies is derived the very name attached to
our <i>Christian</i> sacrament of the Lord's Supper,&mdash;'<i>those holy
Mysteries</i>;'&mdash;and not one or two, but absolutely all and every
one of the observances used in our Christian solemnity. Very
many of our forms of expression in that solemnity are
precisely the same as those that appertained to the Pagan
rite."<a name="FNanchor_309:5_1681" id="FNanchor_309:5_1681"></a><a href="#Footnote_309:5_1681" class="fnanchor">[309:5]</a></p></div>

<p>Prodicus (a Greek sophist of the 5th century <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>) says that, the
ancients worshiped <i>bread</i> as Demeter (<i>Ceres</i>) and <i>wine</i> as Dionysos
(<i>Bacchus</i>);<a name="FNanchor_309:6_1682" id="FNanchor_309:6_1682"></a><a href="#Footnote_309:6_1682" class="fnanchor">[309:6]</a> therefore, when they ate the bread, and drank the
wine, after it had been consecrated, they were doing as the Romanists
claim to do at the present day, <i>i. e.</i>, <i>eating the flesh and drinking
the blood of their god</i>.<a name="FNanchor_309:7_1683" id="FNanchor_309:7_1683"></a><a href="#Footnote_309:7_1683" class="fnanchor">[309:7]</a></p>

<p>Mosheim, the celebrated ecclesiastical historian, acknowledges that:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"The profound respect that was paid to the Greek and Roman
<i>Mysteries</i>, and the extraordinary sanctity that was
attributed to them, induced the Christians of the second
century, to give <i>their</i> religion a <i>mystic</i> air, in order to
put it upon an equal footing in point of dignity, with that of
the Pagans. For this purpose they gave the name of <i>Mysteries</i>
to the institutions of the Gospels, and decorated particularly
the 'Holy Sacrament' with that title; they used the very terms
employed in the <i>Heathen Mysteries</i>, and adopted some of the
rites and ceremonies of which those renowned mysteries
consisted. This imitation began in the eastern provinces; but,
after the time of Adrian, who first introduced the mysteries
among the Latins, it was followed by the Christians who dwelt
in the western part of the empire. A great part, therefore, of
the service of the Church in this&mdash;the second&mdash;century, had a
certain air of the Heathen Mysteries, and resembled them
considerably in many particulars."<a name="FNanchor_310:1_1684" id="FNanchor_310:1_1684"></a><a href="#Footnote_310:1_1684" class="fnanchor">[310:1]</a></p></div>

<p>These Eleusinian Mysteries were accompanied with various rites,
expressive of the purity and self-denial of the worshiper, and were
therefore considered to be an expiation of past sins, and to place the
initiated under the special protection of the awful and potent goddess
who presided over them.<a name="FNanchor_310:8_1691" id="FNanchor_310:8_1691"></a><a href="#Footnote_310:8_1691" class="fnanchor">[310:8]</a></p>

<p>These <i>mysteries</i> were, as we have said, also celebrated in honor of
<i>Bacchus</i> as well as <i>Ceres</i>. A consecrated cup of wine was handed

was many times repeated, and his brightness or glory not only exhibited

<p>The ancient <i>Mexicans</i> celebrated the mysterious sacrament of the
Eucharist, called the "most holy supper," during which they ate the
flesh of their god. The bread used at their Eucharist was made of <i>corn</i>
meal, which they mixed with <i>blood</i>, instead of wine. This was
<i>consecrated</i> by the priest, and given to the people, who ate it with
humility and penitence, <i>as the flesh of their god</i>.<a name="FNanchor_311:9_1700" id="FNanchor_311:9_1700"></a><a href="#Footnote_311:9_1700" class="fnanchor">[311:9]</a></p>

<p>Lord Kingsborough, in his "<i>Mexican Antiquities</i>," speaks of the ancient
Mexicans as performing this sacrament; when they made a cake, which they
called <i>Tzoalia</i>. The high priest blessed it in his manner, after which
he broke it into pieces, and put it into certain very clean vessels. He
then took a thorn of <i>maguery</i>, which resembles a thick needle, with
which he took up with the utmost reverence single morsels, <i>which he put
into the mouth of each individual, after the manner of a
communion</i>.<a name="FNanchor_311:10_1701" id="FNanchor_311:10_1701"></a><a href="#Footnote_311:10_1701" class="fnanchor">[311:10]</a></p>

our Lord."<a name="FNanchor_312:1_1702" id="FNanchor_312:1_1702"></a><a href="#Footnote_312:1_1702" class="fnanchor">[312:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The Rev. Father Acosta says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That which is most admirable in the hatred and presumption of
Satan is, that he hath not only counterfeited in idolatry and
sacrifice, but also in certain ceremonies, <i>our Sacraments</i>,
which Jesus Christ our Lord hath instituted and the holy
Church doth use, having especially pretended to imitate in
some sort the <i>Sacrament of the Communion</i>, which is the most
high and divine of all others."</p></div>

<p>He then relates how the <i>Mexicans</i> and <i>Peruvians</i>, in certain
ceremonies, ate the flesh of their god, and called certain morsels of
paste, "the flesh and bones of <i><ins class="corr" title="original has Vitzilipuzlti">Vitzilipuzlti</ins></i>."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"After putting themselves in order about these morsels and
pieces of paste, they used certain ceremonies with singing, by
means whereof they (the pieces of paste) were blessed and
consecrated for the flesh and bones of this idol."<a name="FNanchor_312:2_1703" id="FNanchor_312:2_1703"></a><a href="#Footnote_312:2_1703" class="fnanchor">[312:2]</a></p></div>

<p>These facts show that the <i>Eucharist</i> is another piece of Paganism
adopted by the Christians. The story of Jesus and his disciples being at
supper, where the Master did break bread, may be true, but the statement
that he said, "Do this in remembrance of me,"&mdash;"this is my body," and
"this is my blood," was undoubtedly invented to give authority to the
<i>mystic</i> ceremony, which had been borrowed from Paganism.</p>

<p>Why should they do this in remembrance of Jesus? Provided he took this
supper with his disciples&mdash;which the <i>John</i> narrator denies<a name="FNanchor_312:3_1704" id="FNanchor_312:3_1704"></a><a href="#Footnote_312:3_1704" class="fnanchor">[312:3]</a>&mdash;he
did not do anything on that occasion new or unusual among Jews. To
pronounce the benediction, break the bread, and distribute pieces
thereof to the persons at table, was, and is now, a common usage of the
Hebrews. Jesus could not have commanded born Jews to do in remembrance
of him what they already practiced, and what every religious Jew does to
this day. The whole story is evidently a myth, as a perusal of it with
the eye of a critic clearly demonstrates.</p>

<p>The <i>Mark</i> narrator informs us that Jesus sent two of his disciples to
the city, and told them this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a
pitcher of water; follow him. And wheresoever he shall go in,
say ye to the <i>goodman</i> of the house, The Master saith, Where
is the guest-chamber, where I shall eat the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>passover with my
disciples? And he will show you a large upper room <i>furnished
and prepared</i>: there make ready for us. And his disciples went
forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto
them: and they made ready the passover."<a name="FNanchor_313:1_1705" id="FNanchor_313:1_1705"></a><a href="#Footnote_313:1_1705" class="fnanchor">[313:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The story of the passover or the last supper, seems to be introduced in
this unusual manner to make it manifest that a divine power is
interested in, and conducting the whole affair, parallels of which we
find in the story of Elieser and Rebecca, where Rebecca is to identify
herself in a manner pre-arranged by Elieser with God;<a name="FNanchor_313:2_1706" id="FNanchor_313:2_1706"></a><a href="#Footnote_313:2_1706" class="fnanchor">[313:2]</a> and also in
the story of Elijah and the widow of Zarephath, where by God's
directions a journey is made, and the widow is found.<a name="FNanchor_313:3_1707" id="FNanchor_313:3_1707"></a><a href="#Footnote_313:3_1707" class="fnanchor">[313:3]</a></p>

<p>It suggests itself to our mind that this style of connecting a
supernatural interest with human affairs was not entirely original with
the Mark narrator. In this connection it is interesting to note that a
man in Jerusalem should have had an unoccupied and <i>properly</i> furnished
room just at <i><ins class="corr" title="original has that that">that</ins></i> time, when two millions of pilgrims sojourned in and
around the city. The man, it appears, was not distinguished either for
wealth or piety, for his <i>name</i> is not mentioned; he was not present at
the supper, and no further reference is made to him. It appears rather
that the Mark narrator imagined an ordinary man who had a furnished room
to let for such purposes, and would imply that Jesus knew it
<i>prophetically</i>. He had only to pass in his mind from Elijah to his
disciple Elisha, for whom the great woman of Shunem had so richly
furnished an upper chamber, to find a like instance.<a name="FNanchor_313:4_1708" id="FNanchor_313:4_1708"></a><a href="#Footnote_313:4_1708" class="fnanchor">[313:4]</a> <i>Why should
not somebody have furnished also an upper chamber for the Messiah?</i></p>

<p>The Matthew narrator's account is free from these embellishments, and
simply runs thus: Jesus said to some of his disciples&mdash;the number is not
given&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master
saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy
house with my disciples. And the disciples did as Jesus had
appointed them; and <i>they</i> made ready the passover."<a name="FNanchor_313:5_1709" id="FNanchor_313:5_1709"></a><a href="#Footnote_313:5_1709" class="fnanchor">[313:5]</a></p></div>

<p>In this account, no pitcher, no water, no prophecy is mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_313:6_1710" id="FNanchor_313:6_1710"></a><a href="#Footnote_313:6_1710" class="fnanchor">[313:6]</a></p>

<p>It was many centuries before the genuine heathen doctrine of
<i>Transubstantiation</i>&mdash;a change of the elements of the Eucharist into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>the <i>real</i> body and blood of Christ Jesus&mdash;became a tenet of the
Christian faith. This greatest of mysteries was developed gradually. As
early as the second century, however, the seeds were planted, when we
find Ignatius, Justin Martyr, and Iren&aelig;us advancing the opinion, that
the mere bread and wine became, in the Eucharist, <i>something
higher</i>&mdash;the earthly, something heavenly&mdash;without, however, ceasing to
be bread and wine. Though these views were opposed by some eminent
individual Christian teachers, yet both among the people and in the
ritual of the Church, the miraculous or supernatural view of the Lord's
Supper gained ground. After the third century the office of presenting
the bread and wine came to be confined to the <i>ministers</i> or <i>priests</i>.
This practice arose from, and in turn strengthened, the notion which was
gaining ground, that in this act of presentation by the priest, a
sacrifice, similar to that once offered up in the death of Christ Jesus,
though bloodless, was ever anew presented to God. This still deepened
the feeling of <i>mysterious</i> significance and importance with which the
rite of the Lord's Supper was viewed, and led to that gradually
increasing splendor of celebration which took the form of the <i>Mass</i>. As
in Christ Jesus two distinct natures, the divine and the human, were
wonderfully combined, so in the Eucharist there was a corresponding
union of the earthly and the heavenly.</p>

<p>For a long time there was no formal declaration of the mind of the
Church on the <i>real presence</i> of Christ Jesus in the Eucharist. At
length a <i>discussion</i> on the point was raised, and the most
distinguished men of the time took part in it. One party maintained that
"the bread and wine are, in the act of consecration, transformed by the
omnipotence of God into the <i>very body</i> of Christ which was once born of
Mary, nailed to the cross, and raised from the dead." According to this
conception, nothing remains of the bread and wine but the outward form,
the taste and the smell; while the other party would only allow that
there is <i>some change</i> in the bread and wine themselves, but granted
that an actual transformation of their power and efficacy takes place.</p>

<p>The greater accordance of the first view with the credulity of the age,
its love for the wonderful and magical, the interest of the priesthood
to add lustre, in accordance with the heathens, to a rite which enhanced
their own office, resulted in the doctrine of Transubstantiation being
declared an article of faith of the Christian Church.</p>

<p>Transubstantiation, the invisible change of the bread and wine <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>into the
body and blood of Christ, is a tenet that may defy the powers of
argument and pleasantry; but instead of consulting the evidence of their
senses, of their sight, their feeling, and their taste, the first
Protestants were entangled in their own scruples, and awed by the
reputed words of Jesus in the institution of the sacrament. Luther
maintained a <i>corporeal</i>, and Calvin a <i>real</i> presence of Christ in the
Eucharist; and the opinion of Zuinglius, that it is no more than a
spiritual communion, a simple memorial, has slowly prevailed in the
reformed churches.<a name="FNanchor_315:1_1711" id="FNanchor_315:1_1711"></a><a href="#Footnote_315:1_1711" class="fnanchor">[315:1]</a></p>

<p>Under Edward VI. the reformation was more bold and perfect, but in the
fundamental articles of the Church of England, a strong and explicit
declaration against the real presence was <i>obliterated</i> in the original
copy, to please the people, or the Lutherans, or Queen Elizabeth. At the
present day, the Greek and Roman Catholics alone hold to the original
doctrine of the <i>real presence</i>.</p>

<p>Of all the religious observances among heathens, Jews, or Turks, none
has been the cause of more hatred, persecution, outrage, and bloodshed,
than the Eucharist. Christians persecuted one another like relentless
foes, and thousands of Jews were slaughtered on account of the Eucharist
and the Host.</p>

says the Protestant divine, "is the <i>natural</i> body and blood of Christ

become the <i>true</i> body and the <i>true</i> blood of Christ, so that the
substance of bread and wine is transmuted into the <i>true</i> body and blood
of Christ. He who denies this calls the omnipotence of Christ in
question, and charges Christ himself with foolishness." (Calvin's
Tracts, p. 214. Translated by Henry Beveridge, Edinburgh, 1851.) In
other parts of his writings, Calvin seems to contradict this statement,
and speaks of the bread and wine in the Eucharist as being <i>symbolical</i>.

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<h3>BAPTISM.</h3>

<p>Baptism, or purification from sin by water, is supposed by many to be an
exclusive <i>Christian</i> ceremony. The idea is that circumcision was given
up, but <i>baptism took its place</i> as a compulsory form indispensable to
salvation, and was declared to have been instituted by Jesus himself or
by his predecessor John.<a name="FNanchor_316:1_1712" id="FNanchor_316:1_1712"></a><a href="#Footnote_316:1_1712" class="fnanchor">[316:1]</a> That Jesus was baptized by John may be
true, or it may not, but that he never directly enjoined his followers
to call the <i>heathen</i> to a share in the privileges of the <i>Golden Age</i>
is gospel doctrine;<a name="FNanchor_316:2_1713" id="FNanchor_316:2_1713"></a><a href="#Footnote_316:2_1713" class="fnanchor">[316:2]</a> and this saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Go out into <i>all the world</i> to preach the gospel to every
creature. And whoever believes and is baptized shall be saved,
but whoever believes not shall be damned,"</p></div>

<p>must therefore be of comparatively late origin, dating from a period at
which the mission to the heathen was not only fully recognized, but even
declared to have originated with the followers of Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_316:3_1714" id="FNanchor_316:3_1714"></a><a href="#Footnote_316:3_1714" class="fnanchor">[316:3]</a> When the
early Christians received members among them they were <i>not</i> initiated
by baptism, but with prayer and laying on of hands. This, says
<i>Eusebius</i>, was the "<i>ancient custom</i>," which was followed until the
time of Stephen. During his bishopric controversies arose as to whether
members should be received "after the ancient Christian custom" or by
baptism,<a name="FNanchor_316:4_1715" id="FNanchor_316:4_1715"></a><a href="#Footnote_316:4_1715" class="fnanchor">[316:4]</a> after the heathen custom. Rev. J. P. Lundy, who has made
ancient religions a special study, and who, being a thorough Christian
writer, endeavors to get over the difficulty by saying that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"John the Baptist simply <i>adopted</i> and practiced the
<i>universal custom</i> of sacred bathing <i>for the remission of
sins</i>. Christ sanctioned it; the church inherited it from his
example."<a name="FNanchor_316:5_1716" id="FNanchor_316:5_1716"></a><a href="#Footnote_316:5_1716" class="fnanchor">[316:5]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p><p>When we say that baptism is a <i>heathen</i> rite adopted by the Christians,
we come near the truth. Mr. Lundy is a strong advocate of the <i>type</i>
theory&mdash;of which we shall speak anon&mdash;therefore the above mode of
reasoning is not to be wondered at.</p>

<p>The facts in the case are that baptism by immersion, or sprinkling in
infancy, <i>for the remission of sin</i>, was a common rite, to be found in
countries the most widely separated on the face of the earth, and the
most unconnected in religious genealogy.<a name="FNanchor_317:1_1717" id="FNanchor_317:1_1717"></a><a href="#Footnote_317:1_1717" class="fnanchor">[317:1]</a></p>

<p>If we turn to India we shall find that in the vast domain of the
Buddhist faith the birth of children is regularly the occasion of a
ceremony, at which the priest is present. In Mongolia and Thibet this
ceremony assumes the special form of <i>baptism</i>. Candles burn and incense
is offered on the domestic altar, the priest reads the prescribed
prayers, <i>dips the child three times in water, and imposes on it a
name</i>.<a name="FNanchor_317:2_1718" id="FNanchor_317:2_1718"></a><a href="#Footnote_317:2_1718" class="fnanchor">[317:2]</a></p>

<p><i>Brahmanism</i>, from the very earliest times, had its initiatory rites,
similar to what we shall find among the ancient Persians, Egyptians,
Greeks and Romans. Mr. Mackenzie, in his "Royal Masonic Cyclop&aelig;dia,"
(<i>sub voce</i> "Mysteries of Hindustan,") gives a capital digest of these
mysteries from the "Indische Alterthum-Skunde" of Lassen. After an
invocation to the <span class="allcapsc">SUN</span>, an oath was demanded of the aspirant, to the
effect of implicit obedience to superiors, purity of body, and
inviolable secrecy. <i>Water was then sprinkled over him</i>, suitable
addresses were made to him, &amp;c. This was supposed to constitute the
<i>regeneration</i> of the candidate, and he was now invested with the white
robe and the tiara. A peculiar cross was marked on his forehead, and the
Tau cross on his breast. Finally, he was given the sacred word, A. U.
M.<a name="FNanchor_317:3_1719" id="FNanchor_317:3_1719"></a><a href="#Footnote_317:3_1719" class="fnanchor">[317:3]</a></p>

<p>The Brahmans had also a mode of baptism similar to the Christian sect of
Baptists, the ceremony being performed in a river.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p><p>The officiating Brahman priest, who was called Gooroo, or
Pastor,<a name="FNanchor_318:1_1720" id="FNanchor_318:1_1720"></a><a href="#Footnote_318:1_1720" class="fnanchor">[318:1]</a> rubbed mud on the candidate, <i>and then plunged him three
times into the water</i>. During the process the priest said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"O Supreme Lord, this man is impure, like the mud of this
stream; but as water cleanses him from this dirt, <i>do thou
free him from his sin</i>."<a name="FNanchor_318:2_1721" id="FNanchor_318:2_1721"></a><a href="#Footnote_318:2_1721" class="fnanchor">[318:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Rivers, as sources of fertility and purification, were at an early date
invested with a sacred character. Every great river was supposed to be
permeated with the divine essence, and its waters held to cleanse from
all moral guilt and contamination. And as the Ganges was the most
majestic, so it soon became the holiest and most revered of all rivers.
No sin too heinous to be removed, no character too black to be washed
clean by its waters. Hence the countless temples, with flights of steps,
lining its banks; hence the array of priests, called "Sons of the
Ganges," sitting on the edge of its streams, ready to aid the ablutions
of conscience-stricken bathers, and stamp them as white-washed when they
emerge from its waters. Hence also the constant traffic carried on in
transporting Ganges water in small bottles to all parts of the
country.<a name="FNanchor_318:3_1722" id="FNanchor_318:3_1722"></a><a href="#Footnote_318:3_1722" class="fnanchor">[318:3]</a></p>

<p>The ceremony of baptism was a practice of the followers of <i>Zoroaster</i>,
both for infants and adults.</p>

<p>M. Beausobre tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The ancient <i>Persians</i> carried their infants to the temple a
few days after they were born, and presented them to the
priest before the sun, and before the fire, which was his
symbol. <i>Then the priest took the child and baptized it for
the purification of the soul.</i> Sometimes he plunged it into a
great vase full of water: it was in the same ceremony that the
father gave a name to the child."<a name="FNanchor_318:4_1723" id="FNanchor_318:4_1723"></a><a href="#Footnote_318:4_1723" class="fnanchor">[318:4]</a></p></div>

<p>The learned Dr. Hyde also tells us that infants were brought to the
temples and baptized by the priests, sometimes by sprinkling and
sometimes by immersion, plunging the child into a large vase filled with
water. This was to them a regeneration, or a purification of their
souls. A name was at the same time imposed upon the child, as indicated
by the parents.<a name="FNanchor_318:5_1724" id="FNanchor_318:5_1724"></a><a href="#Footnote_318:5_1724" class="fnanchor">[318:5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p><p>The rite of baptism was also administered to adults in the <i>Mithraic</i>
mysteries during initiation. The foreheads of the initiated being marked
at the same time with the "<i>sacred sign</i>," which was none other than the
sign of the <span class="allcapsc">CROSS</span>.<a name="FNanchor_319:1_1725" id="FNanchor_319:1_1725"></a><a href="#Footnote_319:1_1725" class="fnanchor">[319:1]</a> The Christian Father Tertullian, who believed
it to be the work of the devil, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He <span class="allcapsc">BAPTIZES</span> his believers and followers; he promises the
remission of sins at the <i>sacred fount</i>, and thus initiates
them into the religion of <i>Mithra</i>; he <i>marks on the forehead</i>
his own soldiers," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_319:2_1726" id="FNanchor_319:2_1726"></a><a href="#Footnote_319:2_1726" class="fnanchor">[319:2]</a></p></div>

<p>"He marks on the forehead," <i>i. e.</i>, he marks <i>the sign of the cross</i> on
their foreheads, just as priests of Christ Jesus do at the present day
to those who are initiated into the Christian mysteries.</p>

<p>Again, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The nations who are strangers to all spiritual powers (the
heathens), ascribe to their idols (gods) the power of
impregnating the waters with the same efficacy as in Christian
baptism." For, "in certain sacred rites of theirs, the mode of
initiation is by baptism," and "whoever had defiled himself
with murder, expiation was sought in purifying water."<a name="FNanchor_319:3_1727" id="FNanchor_319:3_1727"></a><a href="#Footnote_319:3_1727" class="fnanchor">[319:3]</a></p></div>

<p>He also says that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The devil signed his soldiers in the forehead, in imitation
of the Christians."<a name="FNanchor_319:4_1728" id="FNanchor_319:4_1728"></a><a href="#Footnote_319:4_1728" class="fnanchor">[319:4]</a></p></div>

<p>And St. Augustin says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>cross</i> and <i>baptism</i> were never parted."<a name="FNanchor_319:5_1729" id="FNanchor_319:5_1729"></a><a href="#Footnote_319:5_1729" class="fnanchor">[319:5]</a></p></div>

<p>The ancient <i>Egyptians</i> performed their rite of baptism, and those who
were initiated into the mysteries of Isis were baptized.<a name="FNanchor_319:6_1730" id="FNanchor_319:6_1730"></a><a href="#Footnote_319:6_1730" class="fnanchor">[319:6]</a></p>

<p>Apuleius of Madura, in Africa, who was initiated into these mysteries,
shows that baptism was used; that the ceremony was performed by the
attending priest, and that purification and forgiveness of sin was the
result.<a name="FNanchor_319:7_1731" id="FNanchor_319:7_1731"></a><a href="#Footnote_319:7_1731" class="fnanchor">[319:7]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p><p>The custom of baptism in Egypt is known by the hieroglyphic term of
"<i>water of purification</i>." The water so used in immersion absolutely
cleansed the soul, <i>and the person was said to be regenerated</i>.<a name="FNanchor_320:1_1732" id="FNanchor_320:1_1732"></a><a href="#Footnote_320:1_1732" class="fnanchor">[320:1]</a></p>

<p>They also believed in baptism <i>after death</i>, for it was held that the
dead were washed from their sins by Osiris, the beneficent saviour, in
the land of shades, and the departed are often represented (on the
sarcophagi) kneeling before Osiris, who pours over them water from a
pitcher.<a name="FNanchor_320:2_1733" id="FNanchor_320:2_1733"></a><a href="#Footnote_320:2_1733" class="fnanchor">[320:2]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Etruscans</i> performed the rite of baptism. In <i>Tab.</i> clxxii.
Gorius gives two pictures of ancient Etruscan baptism by water. In the
first, the youth is held in the arms of one priest, and another is
pouring water upon his head. In the second, the young person is going
through the same ceremony, kneeling on a kind of altar. At the time of
its baptism the child was named, blessed and marked on the forehead with
<i>the sign of the cross</i>.<a name="FNanchor_320:3_1734" id="FNanchor_320:3_1734"></a><a href="#Footnote_320:3_1734" class="fnanchor">[320:3]</a></p>

<p>Baptism, or the application of water, was a rite well known to the Jews
before the time of Christ Jesus, and was practiced by them when they
admitted proselytes to their religion from heathenism. When children
were baptized they received the sign of the cross, were anointed, and
fed with milk and honey.<a name="FNanchor_320:4_1735" id="FNanchor_320:4_1735"></a><a href="#Footnote_320:4_1735" class="fnanchor">[320:4]</a> "It was not customary, however, among
them, to baptize those who were converted to the Jewish religion, <i>until
after the Babylonish captivity</i>."<a name="FNanchor_320:5_1736" id="FNanchor_320:5_1736"></a><a href="#Footnote_320:5_1736" class="fnanchor">[320:5]</a> This clearly shows that they
learned the rite from their heathen oppressors.</p>

<p>Baptism was practiced by the ascetics of Buddhist origin, known as the
<i>Essenes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_320:6_1737" id="FNanchor_320:6_1737"></a><a href="#Footnote_320:6_1737" class="fnanchor">[320:6]</a> John the Baptist was, evidently, nothing more than a
member of this order, with which the deserts of Syria and the Thebais of
Egypt abounded.</p>

<p>The idea that man is restrained from perfect union with God by his
imperfection, uncleanness and sin, was implicitly believed by the
ancient <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>. In Thessaly was yearly celebrated a great
festival of cleansing. A work bearing the name of "<i>Museus</i>" was a
complete ritual of purifications. The usual mode of purification was
dipping in water (immersion), or <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>it was performed by aspersion. These
sacraments were held to have virtue independent of the dispositions of
the candidates, an opinion which called forth the sneer of Diogenes, the
Grecian historian, when he saw some one undergoing baptism by aspersion<ins class="corr" title="original has extraneous colon">.</ins></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Poor wretch! do you not see that since these sprinklings
cannot repair your grammatical errors, they cannot repair
either, the faults of your life."<a name="FNanchor_321:1_1738" id="FNanchor_321:1_1738"></a><a href="#Footnote_321:1_1738" class="fnanchor">[321:1]</a></p></div>

<p>And the belief that water could wash out the stains of original sin, led
the poet <i>Ovid</i> (43 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>) to say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah, easy fools, to think that a whole flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Of water e'er can purge the stain of blood."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These ancient Pagans had especial gods and goddesses who presided over
the birth of children. The goddess <i>Nundina</i> took her name from the
ninth day, <i>on which all male children were sprinkled with holy
water</i>,<a name="FNanchor_321:2_1739" id="FNanchor_321:2_1739"></a><a href="#Footnote_321:2_1739" class="fnanchor">[321:2]</a> as females were on the eighth, at the same time receiving
their name, of which <i>addition</i> to the ceremonial of Christian baptism
we find no mention in the Christian Scriptures. When all the forms of
the Pagan nundination were duly complied with, the priest gave a
certificate to the parents of the regenerated infant; it was, therefore,
duly recognized as a legitimate member of the family and of society, and
the day was spent in feasting and hilarity.<a name="FNanchor_321:3_1740" id="FNanchor_321:3_1740"></a><a href="#Footnote_321:3_1740" class="fnanchor">[321:3]</a></p>

<p>Adults were also baptized; and those who were initiated in the sacred
rites of the <i>Bacchic</i> mysteries were regenerated and admitted by
baptism, just as they were admitted into the mysteries of Mithra.<a name="FNanchor_321:4_1741" id="FNanchor_321:4_1741"></a><a href="#Footnote_321:4_1741" class="fnanchor">[321:4]</a>
Justin Martyr, like his brother Tertullian, claimed that this ablution
was invented by demons, in imitation of the <i>true</i> baptism, that their
votaries might also have their pretended purification by water.<a name="FNanchor_321:5_1742" id="FNanchor_321:5_1742"></a><a href="#Footnote_321:5_1742" class="fnanchor">[321:5]</a></p>

<p>Infant Baptism was practiced among the ancient inhabitants of northern
Europe&mdash;the Danes, Swedes, Norwegians and Icelanders&mdash;long before the
first dawn of Christianity had reached those parts. Water was poured on
the head of the new-born child, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>a name was given it at the same
time. Baptism is expressly mentioned in the <i>Hava-mal</i> and <i>Rigs-mal</i>,
and alluded to in other epic poems.<a name="FNanchor_322:1_1743" id="FNanchor_322:1_1743"></a><a href="#Footnote_322:1_1743" class="fnanchor">[322:1]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Livonians</i> (inhabitants of the three modern Baltic
provinces of Courland, Livonia, and Esthonia), observed the same
ceremony; which also prevailed among the ancient <i>Germans</i>. This is
expressly stated in a letter which the famous Pope Gregory III. sent to
their apostle Boniface, directing him how to act in respect to
it.<a name="FNanchor_322:2_1744" id="FNanchor_322:2_1744"></a><a href="#Footnote_322:2_1744" class="fnanchor">[322:2]</a></p>

<p>The same ceremony was performed by the ancient Druids of Britain.<a name="FNanchor_322:3_1745" id="FNanchor_322:3_1745"></a><a href="#Footnote_322:3_1745" class="fnanchor">[322:3]</a></p>

<p>Among the <i>New Zealanders</i> young children were baptized. After the
ceremony of baptism had taken place, prayers were offered to make the
child sacred, and clean from all impurities.<a name="FNanchor_322:4_1746" id="FNanchor_322:4_1746"></a><a href="#Footnote_322:4_1746" class="fnanchor">[322:4]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Mexicans</i> baptized their children shortly after birth.
After the relatives had assembled in the court of the parents' house,
the midwife placed the child's head to the east, and prayed for a
blessing from the <i>Saviour</i> <ins class="corr" title="original has Quetzacoatle">Quetzalcoatle</ins>, and the goddess of the water.
The breast of the child was then touched with the fingers dipped in
water, and the following prayer said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"May it (the water) destroy and separate from thee all the
evil that was beginning in thee before the beginning of the
world."</p></div>

<p>After this the child's body was washed with water, and all things that
might injure him were requested to depart from him, "that now he may
live again and be born again."<a name="FNanchor_322:5_1747" id="FNanchor_322:5_1747"></a><a href="#Footnote_322:5_1747" class="fnanchor">[322:5]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Prescott alludes to it as follows, in his "Conquest of
Mexico:"<a name="FNanchor_322:6_1748" id="FNanchor_322:6_1748"></a><a href="#Footnote_322:6_1748" class="fnanchor">[322:6]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The lips and bosom of the infant were sprinkled with water,
and the Lord was implored to permit the holy drops to wash
away that sin that was given to it before the foundation of
the world, so that the child might be born anew." "This
interesting rite, usually solemnized with great formality, in
the presence of assembled friends and relations, is detailed
with minuteness by Sahagun and by Zuazo, both of them
eyewitnesses."</p></div>

<p>Rev. J. P. Lundy says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Now, as baptism of some kind has been the <i>universal custom</i>
of all religious nations and peoples for purification and
regeneration, it is not to be wondered at that it had found
its way from high Asia, the centre of the Old World's religion
and civilization, into the American continent.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>"American priests were found in Mexico, beyond Darien,
baptizing boys and girls a year old in the temples at the
cross, pouring the water upon them from a small
pitcher."<a name="FNanchor_323:1_1749" id="FNanchor_323:1_1749"></a><a href="#Footnote_323:1_1749" class="fnanchor">[323:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The water which they used was called the "<span class="allcapsc">WATER OF REGENERATION</span>."<a name="FNanchor_323:2_1750" id="FNanchor_323:2_1750"></a><a href="#Footnote_323:2_1750" class="fnanchor">[323:2]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Father Acosta alludes to this baptism by saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Indians had an infinite number of other ceremonies and
customs which resembled to the ancient law of Moses, and some
to those which the Moores use, and some approaching near to
the Law of the Gospel, as the baths or <i>Opacuna</i>, as they
called them; <i>they did wash themselves in water to cleanse
themselves from sin</i>."<a name="FNanchor_323:3_1751" id="FNanchor_323:3_1751"></a><a href="#Footnote_323:3_1751" class="fnanchor">[323:3]</a></p></div>

<p>After speaking of "<i>confession which the Indians used</i>," he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When the Inca had been confessed, he made a certain bath to
cleanse himself, in a running river, saying these words: '<i>I
have told my sins to the Sun</i> (his god); <i>receive them, O thou
River, and carry them to the Sea, where they may never appear
more.</i>'"<a name="FNanchor_323:4_1752" id="FNanchor_323:4_1752"></a><a href="#Footnote_323:4_1752" class="fnanchor">[323:4]</a></p></div>

<p>He tells us that the Mexicans also had a baptism for infants, which they
performed with great ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_323:5_1753" id="FNanchor_323:5_1753"></a><a href="#Footnote_323:5_1753" class="fnanchor">[323:5]</a></p>

<p>Baptism was also practiced in Yucatan. They administered it to children
three years old; and called it <span class="allcapsc">REGENERATION</span>.<a name="FNanchor_323:6_1754" id="FNanchor_323:6_1754"></a><a href="#Footnote_323:6_1754" class="fnanchor">[323:6]</a></p>

<p>The ancient Peruvians also baptized their children.<a name="FNanchor_323:7_1755" id="FNanchor_323:7_1755"></a><a href="#Footnote_323:7_1755" class="fnanchor">[323:7]</a></p>

<p>History, then, records the fact that all the principal nations of
antiquity administered the rite of baptism to their children, and to
adults who were initiated into the sacred mysteries. The words
"<i>regenerationem et impunitatem perjuriorum suorum</i>"&mdash;used by the
heathen in this ceremony&mdash;prove that the doctrines as well as the
outward forms were the same. The giving of a name to the child, the
marking of him with the <i>cross</i> as a sign of his being a soldier of
Christ, followed at fifteen years of age by his admission into the
mysteries of the ceremony of <i>confirmation</i>, also prove that the two
institutions are identical. But the most striking feature of all is the
<i>regeneration</i>&mdash;and consequent forgiveness of sins&mdash;the being "<i>born
again</i>." This shows that the Christian baptism in <i>doctrine</i> as well as
in <i>outward ceremony</i>, was precisely that of the heathen. We have seen
that it was supposed to destroy all the evil in him, and all things that
might injure him were requested to depart from him. So likewise among
the Christians; the priest, looking upon the child, and baptizing him,
was formerly accustomed to say:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"I command thee, unclean spirit, in the name of the Father,
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, that thou come out and
depart from this infant, whom our Lord Jesus Christ has
vouchsafed to call to this holy baptism, to be made member of
his body and of his holy congregation. And presume not
hereafter to exercise any tyranny towards this infant, whom
Christ hath bought with his precious blood, and by this holy
baptism called to be of his flock."</p></div>

<p>The ancients also baptized with <i>fire</i> as well as water. This is what is
alluded to many times in the gospels; for instance, Matt. (iii. 11)
makes John say, "I, indeed, baptize you with water; he shall baptize you
with the Holy Ghost and with <span class="allcapsc">FIRE</span>."</p>

<p>The baptism by <i>fire</i> was in use by the Romans; it was performed by
jumping <i>three times</i> through the flames of a sacred fire. This is still
practiced in India. Even at the present day, in some parts of Scotland,
it is a custom at the baptism of children to swing them in their clothes
over a fire <i>three times</i>, saying, "<i>Now, fire, burn this child, or
never.</i>" Here is evidently a relic of the heathen <i>baptism by fire</i>.</p>

<p>Christian baptism was not originally intended to be administered to
unconscious infants, but to persons in full possession of their
faculties, and responsible for their actions. Moreover, it was
performed, as is well known, not merely by sprinkling the forehead, but
by causing the candidate to descend naked into the water, the priest
joining him there, and pouring the water over his head. The catechumen
could not receive baptism until after he understood something of the
nature of the faith he was embracing, and was prepared to assume its
obligations. A rite more totally unfitted for administration to
<i>infants</i> could hardly have been found. Yet such was the need that was
felt for a solemn recognition by religion of the entrance of a child
into the world, that this rite, in course of time, completely lost its
original nature, and, as with the heathen, <i>infancy</i> took the place of
maturity: sprinkling of immersion. But while the age and manner of
baptism were altered, the ritual remained under the influence of the
primitive idea with which it had been instituted. The obligations were
no longer confined to the persons baptized, hence they must be
undertaken for them. Thus was the Christian Church landed in the
absurdity&mdash;unparalleled, we believe, in any other natal ceremony&mdash;of
requiring the most solemn promises to be made, not by those who were
thereafter to fulfill them, <i>but by others in their name</i>; these others
having no power to enforce their fulfillment, and neither those actually
assuming the engagement, nor those on whose behalf it was assumed, being
morally responsible in case it should be broken. Yet this strange
incongruity was forced upon the church by an imperious <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>want of human
nature itself, and the insignificant sects who have adopted the baptism
of adults only, have failed, in their zeal for historical consistency,
to recognize a sentiment whose roots lie far deeper than the
chronological foundation of Christian rites, and stretch far wider than
the geographical boundaries of the Christian faith.</p>

<p>The intention of all these forms of baptism is identical. Water, as the
natural means of physical cleansing, is the universal symbol of
spiritual purification. Hence immersion, or washing, or sprinkling,
implies the deliverance of the infant from the stain of original
sin.<a name="FNanchor_325:1_1756" id="FNanchor_325:1_1756"></a><a href="#Footnote_325:1_1756" class="fnanchor">[325:1]</a> The <i>Pagan</i> and <i>Christian</i> rituals, as we have seen, are
perfectly clear on this head. In both, the avowed intention is to wash
away the sinful nature common to humanity; in both, the infant is
declared to be born again by the agency of water. Among the early
Christians, as with the Pagans, the sacrament of baptism was supposed to
contain a full and absolute expiation of sin; and the soul was instantly
restored to its original purity, and entitled to the promise of eternal
salvation. Among the proselytes of Christianity, there were many who
judged it imprudent to precipitate a salutary rite, which could not be
repeated; to throw away an inestimable privilege, which could never be
recovered. By the delay of their baptism, they could venture freely to
indulge their passions in the enjoyments of this world, while they still
retained in their own hands the means of a sure and easy absolution. St.
Constantine was one of these.</p>

<p>"Every orthodox Hindu is perfectly persuaded that the dirtiest water, if
taken from a <i>sacred stream</i> and applied to his body, either externally
or internally, <i>will purify his soul</i>." (Prof. Monier Williams:
Hinduism, p. 157.) The Egyptians bathed in the water of the Nile; the
Chaldeans and Persians in the Euphrates, and the Hindus, at we have
seen, in the Ganges, all of which were considered as "sacred waters" by
the different nations. The Jews looked upon the Jordan in the same
manner.</p>

<p>Herodotus, speaking of the Persians' manners, says:</p>

<p>"They (the Persians) neither make water, nor spit, nor wash their hands
in a river, nor defile the stream with urine, nor do they allow any one
else to do so, but they pay extreme veneration to all rivers." (Hist.

<h3>THE WORSHIP OF THE VIRGIN MOTHER.</h3>

<p>The worship of the "Virgin," the "Queen of Heaven," the "Great Goddess,"
the "Mother of God," &amp;c., which has become one of the grand features of
the Christian religion&mdash;the Council of Ephesus (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 431) having
declared Mary "Mother of God," her assumption being declared in 813, and
her Immaculate Conception by the Pope and Council in 1851<a name="FNanchor_326:1_1757" id="FNanchor_326:1_1757"></a><a href="#Footnote_326:1_1757" class="fnanchor">[326:1]</a>&mdash;was
almost universal, for ages before the birth of Jesus, and "the <i>pure
virginity</i> of the celestial mother was a tenet of faith for two thousand
years before the virgin now adored was born."<a name="FNanchor_326:2_1758" id="FNanchor_326:2_1758"></a><a href="#Footnote_326:2_1758" class="fnanchor">[326:2]</a></p>

<a name="Fig_16" id="Fig_16"></a><img src="images/16_pg326.png" width="232" height="282" alt="virgin Devaki with her son Crishna" title="" />
</div>

<p>In <i>India</i>, they have worshiped, for ages, <i>Devi</i>, <i>Maha-Devi</i>&mdash;"The One
Great Goddess"<a name="FNanchor_326:3_1759" id="FNanchor_326:3_1759"></a><a href="#Footnote_326:3_1759" class="fnanchor">[326:3]</a>&mdash;and have temples erected in honor of her.<a name="FNanchor_326:4_1760" id="FNanchor_326:4_1760"></a><a href="#Footnote_326:4_1760" class="fnanchor">[326:4]</a>
Gonzales states that among the Indians he found a temple "<i>Paritur&aelig;
Virginis</i>"&mdash;of the Virgin about to bring forth.<a name="FNanchor_326:5_1761" id="FNanchor_326:5_1761"></a><a href="#Footnote_326:5_1761" class="fnanchor">[326:5]</a></p>

<p><i>Maya</i>, the mother of Buddha, and <i>Devaki</i> the mother of Crishna, were
worshiped as <i>virgins</i>,<a name="FNanchor_326:6_1762" id="FNanchor_326:6_1762"></a><a href="#Footnote_326:6_1762" class="fnanchor">[326:6]</a> and represented with the infant Saviours
in their arms, just as the virgin of the Christians is represented at
the present day. Maya was so pure that it was impossible for God, man,
or Asura to view her with carnal desire. Fig. No. 16 is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>a
representation of the Virgin Devaki, with, the infant Saviour Crishna,
taken from Moor's "Hindu Pantheon."<a name="FNanchor_327:1_1763" id="FNanchor_327:1_1763"></a><a href="#Footnote_327:1_1763" class="fnanchor">[327:1]</a> "No person could bear to gaze
upon Devaki, because of the light that invested her." "The gods,
invisible to mortals, celebrated her praise continually from the time
that <i>Vishnu</i> was contained in her person."<a name="FNanchor_327:2_1764" id="FNanchor_327:2_1764"></a><a href="#Footnote_327:2_1764" class="fnanchor">[327:2]</a></p>

<p>"Crishna and his mother are almost always represented <i>black</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_327:3_1765" id="FNanchor_327:3_1765"></a><a href="#Footnote_327:3_1765" class="fnanchor">[327:3]</a>
and the word "<i>Crishna</i>" means "<i>the black</i>."</p>

<p>The <i>Chinese</i>, who have had several <i>avatars</i>, or virgin-born gods,
among them, have also worshiped a Virgin Mother from time immemorial.
Sir Charles Francis Davis, in his "History of China," tells us that the
Chinese at Canton worshiped an idol, to which they gave the name of "The
Virgin."<a name="FNanchor_327:4_1766" id="FNanchor_327:4_1766"></a><a href="#Footnote_327:4_1766" class="fnanchor">[327:4]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Joseph B. Gross, in his "Heathen Religion," tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Upon the altars of the Chinese temples were placed, behind a
screen, an image of <i>Shin-moo</i>, or the '<i>Holy Mother</i>,'
<i>sitting with a child in her arms</i>, in an alcove, with rays of
glory around her head, and tapers constantly burning before
her."<a name="FNanchor_327:5_1767" id="FNanchor_327:5_1767"></a><a href="#Footnote_327:5_1767" class="fnanchor">[327:5]</a></p></div>

<p>Shin-moo is called the "Mother Goddess," and the "Virgin." Her child,
who was exposed in his infancy, was brought up by poor fishermen. He
became a great man, and performed wonderful miracles. In wealthy houses
the sacred image of the "Mother Goddess" is carefully kept in a recess
behind an altar, veiled with a silken screen.<a name="FNanchor_327:6_1768" id="FNanchor_327:6_1768"></a><a href="#Footnote_327:6_1768" class="fnanchor">[327:6]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Gutzlaff, in his "Travels," speaking of the Chinese people,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Though otherwise very reasonable men, they have always showed
themselves bigoted heathens.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They have everywhere built
splendid temples, chiefly in honor of <i>Ma-tsoo-po</i>, the
'<i>Queen of Heaven</i>.'"<a name="FNanchor_327:7_1769" id="FNanchor_327:7_1769"></a><a href="#Footnote_327:7_1769" class="fnanchor">[327:7]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Isis</i>, mother of the Egyptian Saviour, Horus, was worshiped as a
virgin. Nothing is more common on the religious monuments of Egypt than
the infant Horus seated in the lap of his virgin mother. She is styled
"Our Lady," the "Queen of Heaven," "Star of the Sea," "Governess,"
"Mother of God," "Intercessor," "Immaculate <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>Virgin," &amp;c.;<a name="FNanchor_328:1_1770" id="FNanchor_328:1_1770"></a><a href="#Footnote_328:1_1770" class="fnanchor">[328:1]</a> all of
which epithets were in after years applied to the Virgin Mother
worshiped by the Christians.<a name="FNanchor_328:2_1771" id="FNanchor_328:2_1771"></a><a href="#Footnote_328:2_1771" class="fnanchor">[328:2]</a></p>

<p>"The most common representation of Horus is being nursed on the knee of
Isis, or suckled at her breast."<a name="FNanchor_328:3_1772" id="FNanchor_328:3_1772"></a><a href="#Footnote_328:3_1772" class="fnanchor">[328:3]</a> In <i>Monumental Christianity</i>
(Fig. 92), is to be seen a representation of "Isis and Horus." The
infant Saviour is sitting on his mother's knee, while she gazes into his
face. A cross is on the back of the seat. The author, Rev. J. P. Lundy,
says, in speaking of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Is this Egyptian mother, too, meditating her son's conflict,
suffering, and triumph, as she holds him before her and gazes
into his face? And is this <span class="allcapsc">CROSS</span> meant to convey the idea of
life through suffering, and conflict with Typho or Evil?"</p></div>

<p>In some statues and <i>basso-relievos</i>, when Isis appears alone, she is
entirely veiled from head to foot, in common with nearly every other
goddess, as a symbol of a mother's chastity. No mortal man hath ever
lifted her veil.</p>

<p>Isis was also represented standing on the <i>crescent</i> moon, with <i>twelve
stars</i> surrounding her head.<a name="FNanchor_328:4_1773" id="FNanchor_328:4_1773"></a><a href="#Footnote_328:4_1773" class="fnanchor">[328:4]</a> In almost every Roman Catholic
Church on the continent of Europe may be seen pictures and statues of
<i>Mary</i>, the "Queen of Heaven," standing on the crescent moon, and her
head surrounded with <i>twelve</i> stars.</p>

<p>Dr. Inman, in his "Pagan and Christian Symbolism," gives a figure of the
Virgin Mary, with her infant, standing on the <i>crescent moon</i>. In
speaking of this figure, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In it the Virgin is seen as the 'Queen of Heaven,' nursing
her infant, and identified with the crescent moon.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Than
this, nothing could more completely identify the Christian
mother and child, with Isis and Horus."<a name="FNanchor_328:5_1774" id="FNanchor_328:5_1774"></a><a href="#Footnote_328:5_1774" class="fnanchor">[328:5]</a></p></div>

<p>This <i>crescent moon</i> is the symbol of Isis and Juno, and is the <i>Yoni</i>
of the Hindoos.<a name="FNanchor_328:6_1775" id="FNanchor_328:6_1775"></a><a href="#Footnote_328:6_1775" class="fnanchor">[328:6]</a></p>

<p>The priests of Isis yearly dedicated to her a new ship (emblematic of
the <span class="smcap">Yoni</span>), laden with the first fruits of spring. Strange as it may
seem, the carrying in procession of ships, in which the Virgin Mary
takes the place of the heathen goddesses, has not yet wholly gone out of
use.<a name="FNanchor_328:7_1776" id="FNanchor_328:7_1776"></a><a href="#Footnote_328:7_1776" class="fnanchor">[328:7]</a></p>

<p>Isis is also represented, with the infant Saviour in her arms, enclosed
in a framework of the flowers of the Egyptian bean, or <i>lotus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_328:8_1777" id="FNanchor_328:8_1777"></a><a href="#Footnote_328:8_1777" class="fnanchor">[328:8]</a>
The Virgin <i>Mary</i> is very often represented in this manner, as those who
have studied medi&aelig;val art, well know.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p><p>Dr. Inman, describing a painting of the Virgin Mary, which is to be
seen in the South Kensington Museum, and which is enclosed in a
framework of flowers, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It represents the Virgin and Child precisely as she used to
be represented in Egypt, in India, in Assyria, Babylonia,
Ph&oelig;nicia, and Etruria."<a name="FNanchor_329:1_1778" id="FNanchor_329:1_1778"></a><a href="#Footnote_329:1_1778" class="fnanchor">[329:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The lotus and poppy were sacred among all Eastern nations, and were
consecrated to the various virgins worshiped by them. These virgins are
represented holding this plant in their hands, just as the Virgin,
adored by the Christians, is represented at the present day.<a name="FNanchor_329:2_1779" id="FNanchor_329:2_1779"></a><a href="#Footnote_329:2_1779" class="fnanchor">[329:2]</a> Mr.
Squire, speaking of this plant, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is well known that the '<i>Nymphe</i>'&mdash;lotus or water-lily&mdash;is
held sacred throughout the East, and the various sects of that
quarter of the globe represented their deities either
decorated with its flowers, holding it as a sceptre, or seated
on a lotus throne or pedestal. <i>Lacshmi</i>, the beautiful Hindoo
goddess, is associated with the lotus. The Egyptian <i>Isis</i> is
often called the 'Lotus-<i>crowned</i>,' in the ancient
invocations. The Mexican goddess <i>Corieotl</i>, is often
represented with a water-plant resembling the lotus in her
hand."<a name="FNanchor_329:3_1780" id="FNanchor_329:3_1780"></a><a href="#Footnote_329:3_1780" class="fnanchor">[329:3]</a></p></div>

</div>

<p>In Egyptian and Hindoo mythology, the offspring of the virgin is made to
bruise the head of the serpent, but the Romanists have given this office
to the mother. Mary is often seen represented standing on the serpent.
Fig. 17 alludes to this, and to her <i>immaculate conception</i>, which, as
we have seen, was declared by the Pope and council in 1851. The notion
of the divinity of Mary was broached by some at the Council of Nice, and
they were thence named Marianites.</p>

<p>The Christian Father Epiphanius accounts for the fact of the Egyptians
worshiping a virgin and child, by declaring that the prophecy&mdash;"Behold,
a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son"&mdash;must have been revealed
to them.<a name="FNanchor_329:4_1781" id="FNanchor_329:4_1781"></a><a href="#Footnote_329:4_1781" class="fnanchor">[329:4]</a></p>

<p>In an ancient Christian work, called the "Chronicle of Alexandria,"
occurs the following:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"Watch how Egypt has constructed the childbirth of a virgin,
and the birth of her son, <i>who was exposed in a crib to the
adoration of the people</i>."<a name="FNanchor_330:1_1782" id="FNanchor_330:1_1782"></a><a href="#Footnote_330:1_1782" class="fnanchor">[330:1]</a></p></div>

<p>We have another Egyptian Virgin Mother in Neith or Nout, mother of
"Osiris the Saviour." She was known as the "Great Mother," and yet
"Immaculate Virgin."<a name="FNanchor_330:2_1783" id="FNanchor_330:2_1783"></a><a href="#Footnote_330:2_1783" class="fnanchor">[330:2]</a> M. Beauregard speaks of</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Immaculate Conception of the Virgin (Mary), who can
henceforth, as well as the Egyptian Minerva, the mysterious
Neith, boast of having come from herself, and of having given
birth to god."<a name="FNanchor_330:3_1784" id="FNanchor_330:3_1784"></a><a href="#Footnote_330:3_1784" class="fnanchor">[330:3]</a></p></div>

<p>What is known in Christian countries as "Candlemas day," or the
Purification of the Virgin Mary, is of Egyptian origin. The feast of
Candlemas was kept by the ancient Egyptians in honor of the goddess
Neith, and on the very day that is marked on our Christian almanacs as
"Candlemas day."<a name="FNanchor_330:4_1785" id="FNanchor_330:4_1785"></a><a href="#Footnote_330:4_1785" class="fnanchor">[330:4]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Chaldees</i> believed in a celestial virgin, who had purity of
body, loveliness of person, and tenderness of affection; and who was one
to whom the erring sinner could appeal with more chance of success than
to a stern father. She was portrayed as a mother, although a virgin,
with a child in her arms.<a name="FNanchor_330:5_1786" id="FNanchor_330:5_1786"></a><a href="#Footnote_330:5_1786" class="fnanchor">[330:5]</a></p>

<p>The ancient Babylonians and Assyrians worshiped a goddess mother, and
son, who was represented in pictures and in images as an infant in his
mother's arms (see <a href="#Fig_18">Fig. No. 18</a>). Her name was <i>Mylitta</i>, the divine son
was <i>Tammuz</i>, the Saviour, whom we have seen rose from the dead. He was
invested with all his father's attributes and glory, and identified with
him. He was worshiped as <i>mediator</i>.<a name="FNanchor_330:6_1787" id="FNanchor_330:6_1787"></a><a href="#Footnote_330:6_1787" class="fnanchor">[330:6]</a></p>

<p>There was a temple at Paphos, in Cyprus, dedicated to the Virgin
Mylitta, and was the most celebrated one in Grecian times.<a name="FNanchor_330:7_1788" id="FNanchor_330:7_1788"></a><a href="#Footnote_330:7_1788" class="fnanchor">[330:7]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The ancient <i>Etruscans</i> worshiped a Virgin Mother and Son<ins class="corr" title="original has period">,</ins> who was
represented in pictures and images in the arms of his mother. This was
the goddess <i>Nutria</i>, to be seen in <a href="#Fig_19">Fig. No. 19</a>. On the arm of the
mother is an inscription in Etruscan letters. This goddess was also
worshiped in Italy. Long before the Christian era temples and statues
were erected in memory of her. "To the Great Goddess Nutria," is an
inscription which has been found among the ruins of a temple dedicated
to her. No doubt the Roman Church would have claimed her for a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>Madonna,
but most unluckily for them, she has the name "<i>Nutria</i>," in Etruscan
letters on her arm, after the Etruscan practice.</p>

<p>The Egyptian <i>Isis</i> was also worshiped in Italy, many centuries before
the Christian era, and all images of her, with the infant Horus in her
arms, have been adopted, as we shall presently see, by the Christians,
even though they represent her and her child as <i>black</i> as an Ethiopian,
in the same manner as we have seen that Devaki and Crishna were
represented.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 153px;">

</div>

<p>The children of Israel, who, as we have seen in a previous chapter, were
idolaters of the worst kind&mdash;worshiping the sun, moon and stars, and
offering human sacrifices to their god, Moloch&mdash;were also worshipers of
a Virgin Mother, whom they styled the "Queen of Heaven."</p>

<p>Jeremiah, who appeared in Jerusalem about the year 625 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, and who
was one of the prophets and reformers, rebukes the Israelites for their
idolatry and worship of the "Queen of Heaven," whereupon they answer him
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us, in the name of
the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee. But we will certainly
do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn
incense unto the <i>Queen of Heaven</i>, and to pour out drink
offerings unto her, <i>as we have done, we, and our fathers, our
kings, and our princes, in the city of Judah, and in the
streets of Jerusalem</i>: for then we had plenty of victuals, and
were well, and saw no evil.</p>

<p>"But since we left off to burn incense to the <i>Queen of
Heaven</i>, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have
wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by
the famine. And when we burned incense to the <i>Queen of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>Heaven</i>, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make
her <i>cakes</i> to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto
her, without our men?"<a name="FNanchor_332:1_1789" id="FNanchor_332:1_1789"></a><a href="#Footnote_332:1_1789" class="fnanchor">[332:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The "<i>cakes</i>" which were offered to the "Queen of Heaven" by the
Israelites were marked with a <i>cross</i>, or other symbol of sun
worship.<a name="FNanchor_332:2_1790" id="FNanchor_332:2_1790"></a><a href="#Footnote_332:2_1790" class="fnanchor">[332:2]</a> The ancient Egyptians also put a cross on their "sacred
cakes."<a name="FNanchor_332:3_1791" id="FNanchor_332:3_1791"></a><a href="#Footnote_332:3_1791" class="fnanchor">[332:3]</a> Some of the early Christians offered "sacred cakes" to
the Virgin Mary centuries after.<a name="FNanchor_332:4_1792" id="FNanchor_332:4_1792"></a><a href="#Footnote_332:4_1792" class="fnanchor">[332:4]</a></p>

<p>The ancient Persians worshiped the Virgin and Child. On the monuments of
Mithra, the Saviour, the Mediating and Redeeming God of the Persians,
the Virgin Mother of this god is to be seen suckling her infant.<a name="FNanchor_332:5_1793" id="FNanchor_332:5_1793"></a><a href="#Footnote_332:5_1793" class="fnanchor">[332:5]</a></p>

<p>The ancient Greeks and Romans worshiped the Virgin Mother and Child for
centuries before the Christian era. One of these was <i>Myrrha</i>,<a name="FNanchor_332:6_1794" id="FNanchor_332:6_1794"></a><a href="#Footnote_332:6_1794" class="fnanchor">[332:6]</a>
the mother of <i>Bacchus</i>, the Saviour, who was represented with the
infant in her arms. She had the title of "Queen of Heaven."<a name="FNanchor_332:7_1795" id="FNanchor_332:7_1795"></a><a href="#Footnote_332:7_1795" class="fnanchor">[332:7]</a> At
many a <i>Christian</i> shrine the infant Saviour Bacchus may be seen
reposing in the arms of his deified mother. The names are changed&mdash;the
ideas remain as before.<a name="FNanchor_332:8_1796" id="FNanchor_332:8_1796"></a><a href="#Footnote_332:8_1796" class="fnanchor">[332:8]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Stuckley writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Diodorus says Bacchus was born of Jupiter, the Supreme God,
and Ceres (Myrrha). Both Ceres and Proserpine were called
<i>Virgo</i> (Virgin). The story of this woman being deserted by a
man, and espoused by a god, has somewhat so exceedingly like
that passage, Matt. i. 19, 20, of the blessed Virgin's
history, that we should wonder at it, <i>did we not see the
parallelism infinite between the sacred and the profane
history before us</i>.</p>

<p>"There are many similitudes between the Virgin (Mary) and the
mother of Bacchus (also called Mary&mdash;see <a href="#Footnote_332:6_1794">note 6</a> below)&mdash;in all
the old fables. Mary, or Miriam, St. Jerome interprets Myrrha
Maris. Orpheus calls the mother of Bacchus a <i>Sea Goddess</i>
(and the mother of Jesus is called '<i>Mary, Star of the
Sea</i>.'")<a name="FNanchor_332:9_1797" id="FNanchor_332:9_1797"></a><a href="#Footnote_332:9_1797" class="fnanchor">[332:9]</a></p></div>

<p>Thus we see that the reverend and learned Dr. Stuckley has clearly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>made
out that the story of Mary, the "Queen of Heaven," the "Star of the
Sea," the mother of the Lord, with her translation to heaven, &amp;c., was
an <i>old story</i> long before Jesus of Nazareth was born. After this
Stuckley observes that the <i>Pagan</i> "Queen of Heaven" has upon her head a
crown of twelve stars. This, as we have observed above, is the case of
the <i>Christian</i> "Queen of Heaven" in almost every Romish church on the
continent of Europe.</p>

<p>The goddess <i>Cybele</i> was another. She was equally called the "Queen of
Heaven" and the "Mother of God." As devotees now collect alms in the
name of the Virgin Mary, so did they in ancient times in the name of
Cybele. The <i>Galli</i> now used in the churches of Italy, were anciently
used in the worship of Cybele (called <i>Galliambus</i>, and sang by her
priests). "Our Lady Day," or the day of the Blessed Virgin of the Roman
Church, was heretofore dedicated to Cybele.<a name="FNanchor_333:1_1798" id="FNanchor_333:1_1798"></a><a href="#Footnote_333:1_1798" class="fnanchor">[333:1]</a></p>

<p><i>Minerva</i>, who was distinguished by the title of "Virgin Queen,"<a name="FNanchor_333:2_1799" id="FNanchor_333:2_1799"></a><a href="#Footnote_333:2_1799" class="fnanchor">[333:2]</a>
was extensively worshiped in ancient Greece. Among the innumerable
temples of Greece, the most beautiful was the <i>Parthenon</i>, meaning, the
<i>Temple of the Virgin Goddess</i>. It was a magnificent Doric edifice,
dedicated to Minerva, the presiding deity of Athens.</p>

<p><i>Juno</i> was called the "Virgin Queen of Heaven."<a name="FNanchor_333:3_1800" id="FNanchor_333:3_1800"></a><a href="#Footnote_333:3_1800" class="fnanchor">[333:3]</a> She was
represented, like <i>Isis</i> and <i>Mary</i>, standing on the crescent
moon,<a name="FNanchor_333:4_1801" id="FNanchor_333:4_1801"></a><a href="#Footnote_333:4_1801" class="fnanchor">[333:4]</a> and was considered the special protectress of women, from
the cradle to the grave, just as Mary is considered at the present day.</p>

<p><i>Diana</i>, who had the title of "Mother," was nevertheless famed for her
virginal purity.<a name="FNanchor_333:5_1802" id="FNanchor_333:5_1802"></a><a href="#Footnote_333:5_1802" class="fnanchor">[333:5]</a> She was represented, like <i>Isis</i> and <i>Mary</i>,
with stars surrounding her head.<a name="FNanchor_333:6_1803" id="FNanchor_333:6_1803"></a><a href="#Footnote_333:6_1803" class="fnanchor">[333:6]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Muscovites</i> worshiped a sacred group, composed of a woman
with a <i>male child</i> in her lap, and another <i>standing by her</i>. They had
likewise another idol, called <i>the golden heifer</i>, which, says Mr.
Knight, "seems to have been the animal <i>symbol</i> of the same
personage."<a name="FNanchor_333:7_1804" id="FNanchor_333:7_1804"></a><a href="#Footnote_333:7_1804" class="fnanchor">[333:7]</a> Here we have the Virgin and infant Saviour, with the
companion (John the Baptist), and "The <i>Lamb</i> that taketh away the sins
of the world," among the ancient <i>Muscovites</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>before the time of Christ
Jesus. This goddess had also the title of "Queen of Heaven.<ins class="corr" title="quotation mark

<p>The ancient <i>Germans</i> worshiped a virgin goddess under the the name of
<i>Hertha</i>, or Ostara, who was fecundated by the active spirit, <i>i. e.</i>,
the "Holy Spirit."<a name="FNanchor_334:2_1806" id="FNanchor_334:2_1806"></a><a href="#Footnote_334:2_1806" class="fnanchor">[334:2]</a> She was represented in images as a woman with
a child in her arms. This image was common in their consecrated forests,
and was held peculiarly sacred.<a name="FNanchor_334:3_1807" id="FNanchor_334:3_1807"></a><a href="#Footnote_334:3_1807" class="fnanchor">[334:3]</a> The Christian celebration called
<i>Easter</i> derived its <i>name</i> from this goddess.</p>

<p>The ancient <i>Scandinavians</i> worshiped a virgin goddess called Disa. Mr.
R. Payne Knight tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This goddess is delineated on the sacred drums of the
Laplanders, <i>accompanied by a child</i>, similar to the <i>Horus</i>
of the Egyptians, who so often appears in the lap of Isis on
the religious monuments of that people."<a name="FNanchor_334:4_1808" id="FNanchor_334:4_1808"></a><a href="#Footnote_334:4_1808" class="fnanchor">[334:4]</a></p></div>

<p>The ancient <i>Scandinavians</i> also worshiped the goddess Frigga. She was
mother of "Baldur the Good," his father being Odin, the supreme god of
the northern nations. It was she who was addressed, as Mary is at the
present day, in order to obtain happy marriages and easy childbirths.
The Eddas style her the most favorable of the goddesses.<a name="FNanchor_334:5_1809" id="FNanchor_334:5_1809"></a><a href="#Footnote_334:5_1809" class="fnanchor">[334:5]</a></p>

<p>In <i>Gaul</i>, the ancient Druids worshiped the <i>Virgo-Paritura</i> as the
"Mother of God," and a festival was annually celebrated in honor of this
virgin.<a name="FNanchor_334:6_1810" id="FNanchor_334:6_1810"></a><a href="#Footnote_334:6_1810" class="fnanchor">[334:6]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1747 a monument was found at Oxford, England, of pagan
origin, on which is exhibited a female nursing an infant.<a name="FNanchor_334:7_1811" id="FNanchor_334:7_1811"></a><a href="#Footnote_334:7_1811" class="fnanchor">[334:7]</a> Thus we
see that the Virgin and Child were worshiped, in pagan times, from China
to Britain, and, if we turn to the New World, we shall find the same
thing there; for, in the words of Dr. Inman, "even in Mexico the 'Mother
and Child' were worshiped."<a name="FNanchor_334:8_1812" id="FNanchor_334:8_1812"></a><a href="#Footnote_334:8_1812" class="fnanchor">[334:8]</a></p>

<p>This mother, who had the title of "Virgin," and "Queen of
Heaven,"<a name="FNanchor_334:9_1813" id="FNanchor_334:9_1813"></a><a href="#Footnote_334:9_1813" class="fnanchor">[334:9]</a> was Chimalman, or Sochiquetzal, and the infant was
Quetzalcoatle, the crucified Saviour. Lord Kingsborough says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"She who represented 'Our Lady' (among the ancient Mexicans)
had her hair tied up in the manner in which the Indian women
tie and fasten their hair, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>and in the knot behind was
inserted a small <i>cross</i>, by which it was intended to show
that she was the Most Holy."<a name="FNanchor_335:1_1814" id="FNanchor_335:1_1814"></a><a href="#Footnote_335:1_1814" class="fnanchor">[335:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The Mexicans had pictures of this "Heavenly Goddess" on long pieces of
leather, which they rolled up.<a name="FNanchor_335:2_1815" id="FNanchor_335:2_1815"></a><a href="#Footnote_335:2_1815" class="fnanchor">[335:2]</a></p>

<p>The annunciation to the Virgin Chimalman, that she should become the
mother of the Saviour Quetzalcoatle, was the subject of a Mexican
hieroglyphic, and is remarkable in more than one respect. She appears to
be receiving a bunch of flowers from the embassador or angel,<a name="FNanchor_335:3_1816" id="FNanchor_335:3_1816"></a><a href="#Footnote_335:3_1816" class="fnanchor">[335:3]</a>
which brings to mind the <i>lotus</i>, the sacred plant of the East, which is
placed in the hands of the Pagan and Christian virgins.</p>

<p>The 25th of March, which was celebrated throughout the ancient Grecian
and Roman world, in honor of "the Mother of the Gods," was appointed to
the honor of the Christian "Mother of God," and is now celebrated in
Catholic countries, and called "Lady day."<a name="FNanchor_335:4_1817" id="FNanchor_335:4_1817"></a><a href="#Footnote_335:4_1817" class="fnanchor">[335:4]</a> The festival of the
conception of the "Blessed Virgin Mary" is also held on the very day
that the festival of the miraculous conception of the "Blessed Virgin
Juno" was held among the pagans,<a name="FNanchor_335:5_1818" id="FNanchor_335:5_1818"></a><a href="#Footnote_335:5_1818" class="fnanchor">[335:5]</a> which, says the author of the
"Perennial Calendar," "is a remarkable coincidence."<a name="FNanchor_335:6_1819" id="FNanchor_335:6_1819"></a><a href="#Footnote_335:6_1819" class="fnanchor">[335:6]</a> It is not
such a very "remarkable coincidence" after all, when we find that, even
as early as the time of St. Gregory, Bishop of Neo-C&aelig;sarea, who
flourished about <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 240-250, Pagan festivals were changed into
Christian holidays. This saint was commended by his namesake of Nyssa
for changing the Pagan festivals into Christian holidays, the better to
draw the heathens to the religion of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_335:7_1820" id="FNanchor_335:7_1820"></a><a href="#Footnote_335:7_1820" class="fnanchor">[335:7]</a></p>

<p>The month of <i>May</i>, which was dedicated to the heathen Virgin Mothers,
is also the month of Mary, the Christian Virgin.</p>

<p>Now that we have seen that the worship of the Virgin and Child was
universal for ages before the Christian era, we shall say a few words on
the subject of pictures and images of the Madonna&mdash;so called.</p>

<p>The most ancient pictures and statues in Italy and other parts of
Europe, of what are supposed to be representations of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>
and the infant Jesus, are <i>black</i>. The infant god, in the arms of his
black mother, his eyes and drapery white, is himself perfectly
black.<a name="FNanchor_335:8_1821" id="FNanchor_335:8_1821"></a><a href="#Footnote_335:8_1821" class="fnanchor">[335:8]</a></p>

<p>Godfrey Higgins, on whose authority we have stated the above, informs us
that, at the time of his writing&mdash;1825-1835&mdash;images and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>paintings of
this kind were to be seen at the cathedral of Moulins; the famous chapel
of "the Virgin" at Loretto; the church of the Annunciation, the church
of St. Lazaro, and the church of St. Stephens, at <i>Genoa</i>; St. Francis,
at <i>Pisa</i>; the church at <i>Brixen</i>, in the Tyrol; the church at <i>Padua</i>;
the church of St. Theodore, at <i>Munich</i>&mdash;in the two last of which the
white of the eyes and teeth, and the studied redness of the lips, are
very observable.<a name="FNanchor_336:1_1822" id="FNanchor_336:1_1822"></a><a href="#Footnote_336:1_1822" class="fnanchor">[336:1]</a></p>

<p>"The <i>Bambino</i><a name="FNanchor_336:2_1823" id="FNanchor_336:2_1823"></a><a href="#Footnote_336:2_1823" class="fnanchor">[336:2]</a> at <i>Rome</i> is black," says Dr. Inman, "and so are
the Virgin and Child at Loretto."<a name="FNanchor_336:3_1824" id="FNanchor_336:3_1824"></a><a href="#Footnote_336:3_1824" class="fnanchor">[336:3]</a> Many more are to be seen in
Rome, and in innumerable other places; in fact, says Mr. Higgins,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is scarcely an old church in Italy where some remains
of the worship of the <i>black Virgin</i>, and <i>black child</i>, are
not met with;" and that "pictures in great numbers are to be
met with, where the white of the eyes, and of the teeth, and
the lips a little tinged with red, like the black figures in
the museum of the Indian company."<a name="FNanchor_336:4_1825" id="FNanchor_336:4_1825"></a><a href="#Footnote_336:4_1825" class="fnanchor">[336:4]</a></p></div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 237px;">
<a name="Fig_20" id="Fig_20"></a><img src="images/20_pg336.png" width="237" height="283" alt="Virgin of Loretto" title="" />
</div>

<p>Fig. No. 20 is a copy of the image of the Virgin of Loretto. Dr. Conyers
Middleton, speaking of it, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The mention of Loretto puts me in mind of the surprise that I
was in at the first sight of the Holy Image, for its face is
as black as a negro's. But I soon recollected, that this very
circumstance of its complexion made it but resemble the more
exactly the <i>old idols of Paganism</i>."<a name="FNanchor_336:5_1826" id="FNanchor_336:5_1826"></a><a href="#Footnote_336:5_1826" class="fnanchor">[336:5]</a></p></div>

<p>The reason assigned by the Christian priests for the images being black,
is that they are made so by smoke and incense, but, we may ask, if they
became black by smoke, why is it that the <i>white</i> drapery, <i>white</i>
teeth, and the <i>white</i> of the eyes have not changed in color? Why are
the lips of a bright red color? Why, we may also ask, are the black
images crowned and adorned with jewels, just as the images of the Hindoo
and Egyptian virgins are represented?</p>

<p>When we find that the Virgin Devaki, and the Virgin Isis were
represented just as these so-called <i>ancient Christian</i> idols represent
Mary, we are led to the conclusion that they are Pagan idols adopted by
the Christians.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p><p>We may say, in the words of Mr. Lundy, "what jewels are doing on the
neck of this poor and lowly maid, it is not easy to say."<a name="FNanchor_337:1_1827" id="FNanchor_337:1_1827"></a><a href="#Footnote_337:1_1827" class="fnanchor">[337:1]</a> The
<i>crown</i> is also foreign to early representations of the Madonna and
Child, but not so to Devaki and Crishna,<a name="FNanchor_337:2_1828" id="FNanchor_337:2_1828"></a><a href="#Footnote_337:2_1828" class="fnanchor">[337:2]</a> and Isis and Horus. The
<i>coronation</i> of the Virgin Mary is unknown to primitive Christian art,
but is common in Pagan art.<a name="FNanchor_337:3_1829" id="FNanchor_337:3_1829"></a><a href="#Footnote_337:3_1829" class="fnanchor">[337:3]</a> "It may be well," says Mr. Lundy, "to
compare some of the oldest <i>Hindoo</i> representations of the subject with
the Romish, and see how complete the resemblance is;"<a name="FNanchor_337:4_1830" id="FNanchor_337:4_1830"></a><a href="#Footnote_337:4_1830" class="fnanchor">[337:4]</a> and Dr.
Inman says that, "the head-dress, as put on the head of the Virgin Mary,
is of Grecian, Egyptian, and Indian origin."<a name="FNanchor_337:5_1831" id="FNanchor_337:5_1831"></a><a href="#Footnote_337:5_1831" class="fnanchor">[337:5]</a></p>

<p>The whole secret of the fact of these early representations of the
Virgin Mary and Jesus&mdash;so-called&mdash;being <i>black</i>, crowned, and covered
with jewels, is that they are of pre-Christian origin; they are <i>Isis</i>
and <i>Horus</i>, and perhaps, in some cases, Devaki and Crishna, baptized
anew.</p>

<p>The Egyptian "Queen of Heaven" was worshiped in Europe for centuries
before and after the Christian Era.<a name="FNanchor_337:6_1832" id="FNanchor_337:6_1832"></a><a href="#Footnote_337:6_1832" class="fnanchor">[337:6]</a> Temples and statues were also
erected in honor of Isis, one of which was at Bologna, in Italy.</p>

<p>Mr. King tells us that the Emperor Hadrian zealously strove to reanimate
the forms of that old religion, whose spirit had long since passed away,
and it was under his patronage that the creed of the Pharaohs blazed up
for a moment with a bright but fictitious lustre.<a name="FNanchor_337:7_1833" id="FNanchor_337:7_1833"></a><a href="#Footnote_337:7_1833" class="fnanchor">[337:7]</a> To this period
belongs a beautiful sard, in Mr. King's collection, representing
Serapis<a name="FNanchor_337:8_1834" id="FNanchor_337:8_1834"></a><a href="#Footnote_337:8_1834" class="fnanchor">[337:8]</a> and Isis, with the legend: "Immaculate is Our Lady
Isis."<a name="FNanchor_337:9_1835" id="FNanchor_337:9_1835"></a><a href="#Footnote_337:9_1835" class="fnanchor">[337:9]</a></p>

<p>Mr. King further tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The '<i>Black Virgins</i>' so highly reverenced in certain French
cathedrals during the long night of the middle ages, proved,
when at last examined critically, basalt figures of
Isis."<a name="FNanchor_337:10_1836" id="FNanchor_337:10_1836"></a><a href="#Footnote_337:10_1836" class="fnanchor">[337:10]</a></p></div>

<p>And Mr. Bonwick says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We may be surprised that, as Europe has <i>Black</i> Madonnas,
Egypt had <i>Black</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>images and pictures of Isis. At the same
time it is a little odd that the Virgin Mary copies most
honored should not only be <i>Black</i>, but have a decided <i>Isis
cast</i> of feature."<a name="FNanchor_338:1_1837" id="FNanchor_338:1_1837"></a><a href="#Footnote_338:1_1837" class="fnanchor">[338:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The shrine now known as that of the "Virgin in Amadon," in France, was
formerly an old Black <i>Venus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_338:2_1838" id="FNanchor_338:2_1838"></a><a href="#Footnote_338:2_1838" class="fnanchor">[338:2]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To this we may add," (says Dr. Inman), "that at the Abbey of
Einsiedelen, on Lake Zurich, the object of adoration is an old
<i>black doll</i>, dressed in gold brocade, and glittering with
jewels. She is called, apparently, the Virgin of the Swiss
Mountains. My friend, Mr. Newton, also tells me that he saw,
over a church door at Ivrea, in Italy, twenty-nine miles from
Turin, the fresco of a <i>Black</i> Virgin and child, the former
bearing a <i>triple crown</i>."<a name="FNanchor_338:3_1839" id="FNanchor_338:3_1839"></a><a href="#Footnote_338:3_1839" class="fnanchor">[338:3]</a></p></div>

<p>This <i>triple crown</i> is to be seen on the heads of Pagan gods and
goddesses, especially those of the Hindoos.</p>

<p>Dr. Barlow says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The doctrine of the Mother of God was of Egyptian origin. It
was brought in along with the worship of the Madonna by Cyril
(Bishop of Alexandria, and the Cyril of Hypatia) and the monks
of Alexandria, in the fifth century. The earliest
representations of the Madonna have quite a Greco-Egyptian
character, and there can be little doubt that Isis nursing
Horus was the origin of them all."<a name="FNanchor_338:4_1840" id="FNanchor_338:4_1840"></a><a href="#Footnote_338:4_1840" class="fnanchor">[338:4]</a></p></div>

<p>And Arthur Murphy tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The superstition and religious ceremonies of the <i>Egyptians</i>
were diffused over Asia, Greece, <i>and the rest of Europe</i>.
Brotier says, that inscriptions of Isis and Serapis (Horus?)
have been frequently found in <i>Germany</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The missionaries
who went in the eighth and ninth centuries to propagate the
Christian religion in those parts, <i>saw many images and
statues of these gods</i>."<a name="FNanchor_338:5_1841" id="FNanchor_338:5_1841"></a><a href="#Footnote_338:5_1841" class="fnanchor">[338:5]</a></p></div>

<p>These "many images and statues of these gods" were evidently baptized
anew, given other names, and allowed to remain where they were.</p>

<p>In many parts of Italy are to be seen pictures of the Virgin with her
infant in her arms, inscribed with the words: "Deo Soli." This betrays
their Pagan origin.</p>

virgin mothers and goddesses of antiquity should have the same name. The
mother of <i>Bacchus</i> was Myrrha: the mother of Mercury or Hermes was
Myrrha or Maia (See <ins class="corr" title="original has Ferguson's">Fergusson's</ins> Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 186, and
Inman's Ancient Faiths, vol. ii. p. 233); the mother of the Siamese
Saviour&mdash;Sommona Cadom&mdash;was called Maya Maria, <i>i. e.</i>, "the Great
Mary;" the mother of Adonis was Myrrha (See Anacalypsis, vol. i. p. 314,
and Inman's Ancient Faiths, vol. ii. p. 253); the mother of Buddha was
Maya; now, all these names, whether Myrrha, Maia or Maria, are the same
as <i>Mary</i>, the name of the mother of the Christian Saviour. (See Inman's
Ancient Faiths, vol. ii. pp. 353 and 780. Also, Dunlap's Mysteries of
Adoni, p. 124.) The month of <i>May</i> was sacred to these goddesses, so
likewise is it sacred to the Virgin Mary at the present day. <i>She</i> was
also called Myrrha and Maria, as well as Mary. (See Anacalypsis, vol. i.
p. 304, and Son of the Man, p. 26.)</p></div>

<p>The first of the Christian Symbols which we shall notice is the <span class="allcapsc">CROSS</span>.</p>

<p>Overwhelming historical facts show that the cross was used, <i>as a
religious emblem</i>, many centuries before the Christian era, by every
nation in the world. Bishop Colenso, speaking on this subject, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"From the dawn of organized Paganism in the Eastern world, to
the final establishment of Christianity in the West, the cross
was undoubtedly one of the commonest and most sacred of
symbolical monuments. Apart from any distinctions of social or
intellectual superiority, of caste, color, nationality, or
location in either hemisphere, it appears to have been the
aboriginal possession of every people in antiquity.</p>

<p>"Diversified forms of the symbol are delineated more or less
artistically, according to the progress achieved in
civilization at the period, on the ruined walls of temples and
palaces, on natural rocks and sepulchral galleries, on the
hoariest monoliths and the rudest statuary; on coins, medals,
and vases of every description; and in not a few instances,
are preserved in the architectural proportions of subterranean
as well as superterranean structures of tumuli, as well as
fanes.</p>

<p>"Populations of essentially different culture, tastes, and
pursuits&mdash;the highly-civilized and the semi-civilized, the
settled and the nomadic&mdash;vied with each other in their
superstitious <i>adoration</i> of it, and in their efforts to
extend the knowledge of its exceptional import and virtue
amongst their latest posterities.</p>

<p>"Of the several varieties of the cross still in vogue, as
national and ecclesiastical emblems, and distinguished by the
familiar appellations of St. George, St. Andrew, the Maltese,
the Greek, the Latin, &amp;c., &amp;c., <i>there is not one amongst
them, the existence of which may not be traced to the remotest
antiquity. They were the common property of the Eastern
nations.</i></p>

<p>"That each known variety has been derived from a common
source, and is emblematical of one and the same truth may be
inferred from the fact of forms identically the same, whether
simple or complex, cropping out in contrary directions, in the
Western as well as the Eastern hemisphere."<a name="FNanchor_339:1_1842" id="FNanchor_339:1_1842"></a><a href="#Footnote_339:1_1842" class="fnanchor">[339:1]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p><p>The cross has been adored in <i>India</i> from time immemorial, and was a
symbol of mysterious significance in Brahmanical iconography. It was the
symbol of the Hindoo god Agni, the "Light of the World."<a name="FNanchor_340:1_1843" id="FNanchor_340:1_1843"></a><a href="#Footnote_340:1_1843" class="fnanchor">[340:1]</a></p>

<p>In the Cave of Elephanta, over the head of the figure represented as
destroying the infants, whence the story of Herod and the infants of
Bethlehem (which was unknown to all the Jewish, Roman, and Grecian
historians) took its origin, may be seen the Mitre, the Crosier, and the
Cross.<a name="FNanchor_340:2_1844" id="FNanchor_340:2_1844"></a><a href="#Footnote_340:2_1844" class="fnanchor">[340:2]</a></p>

<p>It is placed by <ins class="corr" title="original has Muller">M&uuml;ller</ins> in the hand of Siva, Brahma, Vishnu, Crishna,
Tvashtri and Jama. To it the worshipers of Vishnu attribute as many
virtues as does the devout Catholic to the Christian cross.<a name="FNanchor_340:3_1845" id="FNanchor_340:3_1845"></a><a href="#Footnote_340:3_1845" class="fnanchor">[340:3]</a> Fra

<p>Two of the principal pagodas of India&mdash;Benares and Mathura&mdash;were erected
in the forms of vast crosses.<a name="FNanchor_340:5_1847" id="FNanchor_340:5_1847"></a><a href="#Footnote_340:5_1847" class="fnanchor">[340:5]</a> The pagoda at Mathura was sacred to
the memory of the Virgin-born and crucified Saviour Crishna.<a name="FNanchor_340:6_1848" id="FNanchor_340:6_1848"></a><a href="#Footnote_340:6_1848" class="fnanchor">[340:6]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The cross has been an object of profound veneration among the Buddhists
from the earliest times. One is the sacred Swastica (<a href="#Fig_21">Fig. No. 21</a>). It is
seen in the old Buddhist Zodiacs, and is one of the symbols in the Asoka
inscriptions. It is the sectarian mark of the Jains, and the distinctive
badge of the sect of Xaca Japonicus. The Vaishnavas of India have also
the same sacred sign.<a name="FNanchor_340:7_1849" id="FNanchor_340:7_1849"></a><a href="#Footnote_340:7_1849" class="fnanchor">[340:7]</a> And, according to Arthur Lillie,<a name="FNanchor_340:8_1850" id="FNanchor_340:8_1850"></a><a href="#Footnote_340:8_1850" class="fnanchor">[340:8]</a>
"<i>the only Christian cross in the catacombs is this Buddhist Swastica</i>."</p>

<a name="Fig_22" id="Fig_22"></a><img src="images/22_pg340.png" width="191" height="276" alt="Buddhist cross" title="" />
</div>

<p>The cross is adored by the followers of the Lama of Thibet.<a name="FNanchor_340:9_1851" id="FNanchor_340:9_1851"></a><a href="#Footnote_340:9_1851" class="fnanchor">[340:9]</a> Fig.
No. 22 is a representation of the most familiar form of Buddhist cross.
The close <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>resemblance between the ancient religion of Thibet and that
of the Christians has been noticed by many European travellers and
missionaries, among whom may be mentioned Pere Grebillon, Pere Grueber,
Horace de la Paon, D'Orville, and M. L'Abb&eacute; Huc. The Buddhists, and
indeed all the sects of India, marked their followers on the head with
the sign of the cross.<a name="FNanchor_341:1_1852" id="FNanchor_341:1_1852"></a><a href="#Footnote_341:1_1852" class="fnanchor">[341:1]</a> This was undoubtedly practiced by almost
all heathen nations, as we have seen in the chapter on the <a href="#CHAPTER_XXX"><i>Eucharist</i></a>
that the initiates into the Heathen mysteries were marked in that
manner.</p>

<p>The ancient <i>Egyptians</i> adored the cross with the profoundest
veneration. This sacred symbol is to be found on many of their ancient
monuments, some of which may be seen at the present day in the British
Museum.<a name="FNanchor_341:2_1853" id="FNanchor_341:2_1853"></a><a href="#Footnote_341:2_1853" class="fnanchor">[341:2]</a> In the museum of the London University, a cross upon a

mummies.<a name="FNanchor_341:3_1854" id="FNanchor_341:3_1854"></a><a href="#Footnote_341:3_1854" class="fnanchor">[341:3]</a> Many of the Egyptian images hold a cross in their hand.
There is one now extant of the Egyptian Saviour Horus holding a cross in
his hand,<a name="FNanchor_341:4_1855" id="FNanchor_341:4_1855"></a><a href="#Footnote_341:4_1855" class="fnanchor">[341:4]</a> and he is represented as an infant sitting on his
mother's knee, with a cross on the back of the seat they occupy.<a name="FNanchor_341:5_1856" id="FNanchor_341:5_1856"></a><a href="#Footnote_341:5_1856" class="fnanchor">[341:5]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The commonest of all the Egyptian crosses, the <span class="allcapsc">CRUX ANSATA</span> (Fig. No. 23)
was adopted by the Christians. Thus, beside one of the Christian
inscriptions at Phile (a celebrated island lying in the midst of the
Nile) is seen both a <i>Maltese cross</i> and a <i>crux ansata</i>.<a name="FNanchor_341:6_1857" id="FNanchor_341:6_1857"></a><a href="#Footnote_341:6_1857" class="fnanchor">[341:6]</a> In a
painting covering the end of a church in the cemetery of El Khargeh, in
the Great Oasis, are three of these crosses round the principal subject,
which seems to have been a figure of a saint.<a name="FNanchor_341:7_1858" id="FNanchor_341:7_1858"></a><a href="#Footnote_341:7_1858" class="fnanchor">[341:7]</a> In an inscription
in a Christian church to the east of the Nile, in the desert, these
crosses are also to be seen. Beside, or in the hand of, the Egyptian
gods, this symbol is generally to be seen. When the Saviour Osiris is
represented holding out the <i>crux ansata</i> to a mortal, it signifies that
the person to whom he presents it has put off mortality, and entered on
the life to come.<a name="FNanchor_341:8_1859" id="FNanchor_341:8_1859"></a><a href="#Footnote_341:8_1859" class="fnanchor">[341:8]</a></p>

<p>The Greek cross, and the cross of St. Anthony, are also found <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>on
Egyptian monuments. A figure of a Shari (Fig. No. 24), from Sir Gardner
Wilkinson's book, has a necklace round his throat, from which depends a
pectoral cross. A third Egyptian cross is that represented in Fig. No.
25, which is apparently intended for a Latin cross rising out of a
heart, like the medi&aelig;val emblem of "<i>Cor in Cruce, Crux in Corde</i>:" it
is the <ins class="corr" title="original has hierogylph">hieroglyph</ins> of goodness.<a name="FNanchor_342:1_1860" id="FNanchor_342:1_1860"></a><a href="#Footnote_342:1_1860" class="fnanchor">[342:1]</a></p>

<p>It is related by the ecclesiastical historians Socrates and Sozomon,
that when the temple of Serapis, at Alexandria, in Egypt, was demolished
by one of the Christian emperors, beneath the foundation was discovered
a cross. The words of Socrates are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the temple of Serapis, now overthrown and rifled
throughout, there were found engraven in the stones certain
letters .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. resembling the form of the cross. The which when
both Christians and Ethnics beheld, every one applied to his
proper religion. The Christians affirmed that the cross was a
sign or token of the passion of Christ, and the proper
cognizance of their profession. <i>The Ethnics avouched that
therein was contained something in common, belonging as well
to Serapis as to Christ.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_342:2_1861" id="FNanchor_342:2_1861"></a><a href="#Footnote_342:2_1861" class="fnanchor">[342:2]</a></p></div>

<p>It should be remembered, in connection with this, that the Emperor
Hadrian saw no difference between the worshipers of Serapis and the
worshipers of Christ Jesus. In a letter to the Consul Servanus he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There are there (in Egypt) <i>Christians</i> who worship
<i>Serapis</i>, and devoted to Serapis are those who call
themselves '<i>Bishops of Christ</i>.'"<a name="FNanchor_342:3_1862" id="FNanchor_342:3_1862"></a><a href="#Footnote_342:3_1862" class="fnanchor">[342:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The ancient Egyptians were in the habit of putting a cross on their
sacred cakes, just as the Christians of the present day do on Good
Friday.<a name="FNanchor_342:4_1863" id="FNanchor_342:4_1863"></a><a href="#Footnote_342:4_1863" class="fnanchor">[342:4]</a> The plan of the chamber of some Egyptian sepulchres has
the form of a cross,<a name="FNanchor_342:5_1864" id="FNanchor_342:5_1864"></a><a href="#Footnote_342:5_1864" class="fnanchor">[342:5]</a> and the cross was worn by Egyptian ladies as
an ornament, in precisely the same manner as Christian ladies wear it at
the present day.<a name="FNanchor_342:6_1865" id="FNanchor_342:6_1865"></a><a href="#Footnote_342:6_1865" class="fnanchor">[342:6]</a></p>

<p>The ancient Babylonians honored the cross as a religious symbol. It is
to be found on their oldest monuments. Anu, a deity who stood at the
head of the Babylonian mythology, had a cross for his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>sign or
symbol.<a name="FNanchor_343:1_1866" id="FNanchor_343:1_1866"></a><a href="#Footnote_343:1_1866" class="fnanchor">[343:1]</a> It is also the <ins class="corr" title="original has symobl">symbol</ins> of the Babylonian god Bal.<a name="FNanchor_343:2_1867" id="FNanchor_343:2_1867"></a><a href="#Footnote_343:2_1867" class="fnanchor">[343:2]</a> A
cross hangs on the breast of Tiglath Pileser, in the colossal tablet
from Nimroud, now in the British Museum. Another king, from the ruins of
Ninevah, wears a Maltese cross on his bosom. And another, from the hall
of Nisroch, carries an emblematic necklace, to which a Maltese cross is
attached.<a name="FNanchor_343:3_1868" id="FNanchor_343:3_1868"></a><a href="#Footnote_343:3_1868" class="fnanchor">[343:3]</a> The most common of crosses, the <i>crux ansata</i> (<a href="#Fig_21">Fig. No.
21</a>) was also a sacred symbol among the Babylonians. It occurs repeatedly
on their cylinders, bricks and gems.<a name="FNanchor_343:4_1869" id="FNanchor_343:4_1869"></a><a href="#Footnote_343:4_1869" class="fnanchor">[343:4]</a></p>

<p>The ensigns and standards carried by the Persians during their wars with
Alexander the Great (<span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> 335), were made in the form of a cross&mdash;as we
shall presently see was the style of the ancient <i>Roman</i> standards&mdash;and
representations of these cross-standards have been handed down to the
present day.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Ker Porter, in his very valuable work entitled: "Travels in
Georgia, Persia, Armenia, and Ancient Babylonia,"<a name="FNanchor_343:5_1870" id="FNanchor_343:5_1870"></a><a href="#Footnote_343:5_1870" class="fnanchor">[343:5]</a> shows the
representation of a <i>bas-relief</i>, of very ancient antiquity, which he
found at Nashi-Roustam, or the Mountain of Sepulchres. It represents a
combat between two horsemen&mdash;Baharam-Gour, one of the old Persian kings,
and a Tartar prince. Baharam-Gour is in the act of charging his opponent
with a spear, and behind him, scarcely visible, appears an almost
effaced form, which must have been his standard-bearer, as the <i>ensign</i>
is very plainly to be seen. <i>This ensign is a cross.</i> There is another
representation of the same subject to be seen in a <i>bas-relief</i>, which
shows the standard-bearer and his <i>cross</i> ensign very plainly.<a name="FNanchor_343:6_1871" id="FNanchor_343:6_1871"></a><a href="#Footnote_343:6_1871" class="fnanchor">[343:6]</a>
This <i>bas-relief</i> belongs to a period when the Arsacedian kings governed
Persia,<a name="FNanchor_343:7_1872" id="FNanchor_343:7_1872"></a><a href="#Footnote_343:7_1872" class="fnanchor">[343:7]</a> which was within a century after the time of Alexander,
and consequently more than two centuries <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 178px;">
<a name="Fig_26" id="Fig_26"></a><img src="images/26_pg344.png" width="178" height="280" alt="two men carrying a cross" title="" />
</div>

<p>Sir Robert also found at this place, sculptures cut in the solid rock,
which are in the form of crosses. These belong to the early race of
Persian monarchs, whose dynasty terminated under the sword of Alexander
the Great.<a name="FNanchor_343:8_1873" id="FNanchor_343:8_1873"></a><a href="#Footnote_343:8_1873" class="fnanchor">[343:8]</a> At the foot of Mount Nakshi-Rajab, he also found
<i>bas-reliefs</i>, among which were two figures carrying a cross-standard.
<a href="#Fig_26">Fig. No. 26</a> is a representation of this.<a name="FNanchor_343:9_1874" id="FNanchor_343:9_1874"></a><a href="#Footnote_343:9_1874" class="fnanchor">[343:9]</a> It is coeval with the
sculptures found at Nashi-Roustam,<a name="FNanchor_343:10_1875" id="FNanchor_343:10_1875"></a><a href="#Footnote_343:10_1875" class="fnanchor">[343:10]</a> and therefore belongs to a
period before the time of Alexander's invasion.</p>

<p>The cross is represented frequently and prominently on the coins <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>of
Asia Minor. Several have a ram or lamb on one side, and a cross on the
other.<a name="FNanchor_344:1_1876" id="FNanchor_344:1_1876"></a><a href="#Footnote_344:1_1876" class="fnanchor">[344:1]</a> On some of the early coins of the Phenicians, the cross is
found attached to a chaplet of beads placed in a circle, so as to form a
complete rosary, such as the Lamas of Thibet and China, the Hindoos, and
the Roman Catholics, now tell over while they pray.<a name="FNanchor_344:2_1877" id="FNanchor_344:2_1877"></a><a href="#Footnote_344:2_1877" class="fnanchor">[344:2]</a> On a
Phenician medal, found in the ruins of Citium, in Cyprus, and printed in
Dr. Clark's "Travels" (vol. ii. c. xi.), are engraved a cross, a rosary,
and a lamb.<a name="FNanchor_344:3_1878" id="FNanchor_344:3_1878"></a><a href="#Footnote_344:3_1878" class="fnanchor">[344:3]</a> This is the "Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of
the world."</p>

<p>The ancient Etruscans revered the cross as a religious emblem. This
sacred sign, accompanied with the heart, is to be seen on their
monuments. <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. No. 27</a>, taken from the work of Gorrio (Tab. xxxv.),
shows an ancient tomb with angels and the cross thereon. It would answer
perfectly for a Christian cemetery.</p>

<p>The cross was adored by the ancient Greeks and Romans for centuries
before the Augustan era. An ancient inscription in Thessaly is
accompanied by a Calvary cross (<a href="#Fig_28">Fig. No. 28</a>); and Greek crosses of equal
arms adorn the tomb of Midas (one of the ancient kings), in
Phrygia.<a name="FNanchor_344:4_1879" id="FNanchor_344:4_1879"></a><a href="#Footnote_344:4_1879" class="fnanchor">[344:4]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p><p>The adoration of the cross by the Romans is spoken of by the Christian
Father Minucius Felix, when denying the charge of idolatry which was
made against his sect.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As for the adoration of cross," (says he to the Romans),
"which you object against us, I must tell you that we neither
adore crosses nor desire them. You it is, ye Pagans, who
worship wooden gods, who are the most likely people to adore
wooden crosses, as being part of the same substance with your
deities. For what else are your ensigns, flags, and standards,
but crosses, gilt and beautiful. Your victorious trophies not
only represent a cross, but a cross with a man upon
it."<a name="FNanchor_345:1_1880" id="FNanchor_345:1_1880"></a><a href="#Footnote_345:1_1880" class="fnanchor">[345:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The principal silver coin among the Romans, called the <i>denarius</i>, had
on one side a personification of Rome as a warrior with a helmet, and on
the reverse, a chariot drawn by four horses. The driver had a
cross-standard in one hand. This is a representation of a denarius of
the earliest kind, which was first coined 296 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span><a name="FNanchor_345:2_1881" id="FNanchor_345:2_1881"></a><a href="#Footnote_345:2_1881" class="fnanchor">[345:2]</a> The cross was
used on the roll of the Roman soldiery as the sign of <i>life</i>.<a name="FNanchor_345:3_1882" id="FNanchor_345:3_1882"></a><a href="#Footnote_345:3_1882" class="fnanchor">[345:3]</a></p>

<p>But, long before the Romans, long before the Etruscans, there lived in
the plains of Northern Italy a people to whom the cross was a religious
symbol, the sign beneath which they laid their dead to rest; a people of
whom history tells nothing, knowing not their name; but of whom
antiquarian research has learned this, that they lived in ignorance of
the arts of civilization, that they dwelt in villages built on platforms
over lakes, and that they trusted to the cross to guard, and may be to
revive, their loved ones whom they committed to the dust.</p>

<p>The examination of the tombs of Golasecca proves, in a most convincing,
positive, and precise manner that which the terramares of Emilia had
only indicated, but which had been confirmed by the cemetery of
Villanova, that above a thousand years <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, the cross was already a
religious emblem of frequent employment.<a name="FNanchor_345:4_1883" id="FNanchor_345:4_1883"></a><a href="#Footnote_345:4_1883" class="fnanchor">[345:4]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is more than a coincidence," (says the Rev. S.
Baring-Gould), "that Osiris by the cross should give life
eternal to the spirits of the just; that with the cross Thor
should smite the head of the great Serpent, and bring to life
those who were slain; that beneath the cross the Muysca
mothers should lay their babes, trusting to that sign to
secure them from the power of evil spirits; that with that
symbol to protect them, the ancient people of Northern Italy
should lay them down in the dust."<a name="FNanchor_345:5_1884" id="FNanchor_345:5_1884"></a><a href="#Footnote_345:5_1884" class="fnanchor">[345:5]</a></p></div>

<p>The cross was also found among the ruins of Pompeii.<a name="FNanchor_345:6_1885" id="FNanchor_345:6_1885"></a><a href="#Footnote_345:6_1885" class="fnanchor">[345:6]</a></p>

<p>It was a sacred emblem among the ancient Scandinavians.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"It occurs" (says Mr. R. Payne Knight), "on many Runic
monuments found in Sweden and Denmark, which are of an age
long anterior to the approach of Christianity to those
countries, and, probably, to its appearance in the
world."<a name="FNanchor_346:1_1886" id="FNanchor_346:1_1886"></a><a href="#Footnote_346:1_1886" class="fnanchor">[346:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Their god Thor, son of the Supreme god Odin, and the goddess Freyga, had
the hammer for his symbol. It was with this hammer that Thor crushed the
head of the great Mitgard serpent, that he destroyed the giants, that he
restored the dead goats to life, which drew his car, that he consecrated
the pyre of Baldur. <i>This hammer was a cross.</i><a name="FNanchor_346:2_1887" id="FNanchor_346:2_1887"></a><a href="#Footnote_346:2_1887" class="fnanchor">[346:2]</a></p>

<p>The cross of Thor is still used in Iceland as a magical sign in
connection with storms of wind and rain.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Actually, they both made the same symbol.</p>

<p>This we are told by Snorro Sturleson, in the Heimskringla (Saga iv. c.
18), when he describes the sacrifice at Lade, at which King Hakon,
Athelstan's foster-son, was present:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Now when the first full goblet was filled, Earl Sigurd spoke
some words over it, and blessed it in Odin's name, and drank
to the king out of the horn; and the king then took it, and
made the sign of the cross over it. Then said Kaare of
Greyting, 'What does the king mean by doing so? will he not
sacrifice?' But Earl Sigurd replied, 'The King is doing what
all of you do who trust in your power and strength; for he is
blessing the full goblet in the name of Thor, by making the
sign of his hammer over it before he drinks it."<a name="FNanchor_346:3_1888" id="FNanchor_346:3_1888"></a><a href="#Footnote_346:3_1888" class="fnanchor">[346:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The cross was also a <i>sacred</i> emblem among the <i>Laplanders</i>. "In solemn
sacrifices, all the Lapland idols were marked with it from the blood of
the victims."<a name="FNanchor_346:4_1889" id="FNanchor_346:4_1889"></a><a href="#Footnote_346:4_1889" class="fnanchor">[346:4]</a></p>

<p>It was adored by the ancient <i>Druids</i> of Britain, and is to be seen on
the so-called "fire towers" of Ireland and Scotland. The "consecrated
trees" of the Druids had a <i>cross beam</i> attached to them, making the
figure of a cross. On several of the most curious and most ancient
monuments of Britain, the cross is to be seen, evidently cut thereon by
the Druids. Many large stones throughout Ireland have these Druid
crosses cut in them.<a name="FNanchor_346:5_1890" id="FNanchor_346:5_1890"></a><a href="#Footnote_346:5_1890" class="fnanchor">[346:5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p><p>Cleland observes, in his "Attempt to Revive Celtic Literature," that
the Druids taught the doctrine of an overruling providence, and the
immortality of the soul: that they had also their Lent, their Purgatory,
their Paradise, their Hell, their Sanctuaries, and the similitude of the
May-pole <i>in form to the cross</i>.<a name="FNanchor_347:1_1891" id="FNanchor_347:1_1891"></a><a href="#Footnote_347:1_1891" class="fnanchor">[347:1]</a></p>

<p>"In the Island of I-com-kill, at the monastery of the Culdees, at the

<p>When the Spanish missionaries first set foot upon the soil of <i>America</i>,
in the fifteenth century, they were amazed to find that the <i>cross</i> was
as devoutly worshiped by the red Indians as by themselves. The hallowed
symbol challenged their attention on every hand, and in almost every
variety of form. And, what is still more remarkable, the cross was not
only associated with other objects corresponding in every particular
with those delineated on Babylonian monuments; but it was also
distinguished by the Catholic appellations, "the tree of subsistence,"
"the wood of health," "the emblem of life," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_347:5_1895" id="FNanchor_347:5_1895"></a><a href="#Footnote_347:5_1895" class="fnanchor">[347:5]</a></p>

<p>When the Spanish missionaries found that the cross was no new object of
veneration to the red men, they were in doubt whether to ascribe the
fact to the pious labors of St. Thomas, whom they thought might have
found his way to America, or the sacrilegious subtlety of Satan. It was
the central object in the great temple of Cozamel, and is still
preserved on the <i>bas-reliefs</i> of the ruined city of Palenque. From time
immemorial it had received the prayers and sacrifices of the Aztecs and
Toltecs, and was suspended as an august emblem from the walls of temples
in Popogan and Cundinamarca.<a name="FNanchor_347:6_1896" id="FNanchor_347:6_1896"></a><a href="#Footnote_347:6_1896" class="fnanchor">[347:6]</a></p>

<p>The ruined city of Palenque is in the depths of the forests of Central
America. It was not inhabited at the time of the conquest of Mexico by
the Spaniards. They discovered the temples and palaces of Chiapa, but of
Palenque they knew nothing. According to tradition it was founded by
Votan in the ninth century before the Christian era. The principal
building in this ruined city is the palace. A noble tower rises above
the courtyard in the centre. In <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>this building are several small temples
or chapels, with altars standing. At the back of one of these altars is
a slab of gypsum, on which are sculptured two figures, one on each side
of a cross (Fig. No. 29). The cross is surrounded with rich
feather-work, and ornamental chains.<a name="FNanchor_348:1_1897" id="FNanchor_348:1_1897"></a><a href="#Footnote_348:1_1897" class="fnanchor">[348:1]</a> "The style of scripture,"

<p>The same cross is represented on old pre-Mexican MSS., as in the Dresden
Codex, and that in the possession of Herr Fejervary, at the end of which
is a colossal cross, in the midst of which is represented a bleeding
deity, and figures stand round a <i>Tau</i> cross, upon which is perched the
sacred bird.<a name="FNanchor_348:3_1899" id="FNanchor_348:3_1899"></a><a href="#Footnote_348:3_1899" class="fnanchor">[348:3]</a></p>

<p>The cross was also used in the north of Mexico. It occurs among the
Mixtecas and in Queredaro. Siguenza speaks of an Indian cross which was
found in the cave of Mixteca Baja. Among the ruins on the island of
Zaputero, in Lake Nicaragua, were also found old crosses reverenced by
the Indians. White marble crosses were found on the island of St. Ulloa,
on its discovery. In the state of Oaxaca, the Spaniards found that
wooden crosses were erected as sacred symbols, so also in Aguatoleo, and
among the Zapatecas. The cross was venerated as far as Florida on one
side, and Cibola on the other. In South America, the same sign was
considered symbolical and sacred. It was revered in Paraguay. In Peru
the Incas honored a cross made out of a single piece of jasper; it was
an emblem belonging to a former civilization.<a name="FNanchor_348:4_1900" id="FNanchor_348:4_1900"></a><a href="#Footnote_348:4_1900" class="fnanchor">[348:4]</a></p>

<p>Among the Muyscas at Cumana the cross was regarded with devotion, and
was believed to be endowed with power to drive away evil spirits;
consequently new-born children were placed under the sign.<a name="FNanchor_348:5_1901" id="FNanchor_348:5_1901"></a><a href="#Footnote_348:5_1901" class="fnanchor">[348:5]</a></p>

<p>The Toltecs said that their national deity Quetzalcoatle&mdash;whom we have
found to be a virgin-born and crucified Saviour&mdash;had introduced <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>the
sign and ritual of the cross, and it was called the "Tree of Nutriment,"

<p>Malcom, in his "Antiquities of Britain," says</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Gomara tells that St. Andrew's cross, which is the same with
that of Burgundy, was in great veneration among the Cumas, in
South America, and that they fortified themselves with the

deserves admiration."<a name="FNanchor_349:2_1903" id="FNanchor_349:2_1903"></a><a href="#Footnote_349:2_1903" class="fnanchor">[349:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Felix Cabrara, in his "Description of the Ancient City of Mexico," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The adoration of the cross has been more general in the
world, than that of any other emblem. It is to be found in the
ruins of the fine city of Mexico, near Palenque, where there

<p>In "Chambers's Encyclop&aelig;dia" we find the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It appears that the sign of the <i>cross</i> was in use <i>as an

<p>Lord Kingsborough, in his "Antiquities of Mexico," speaks of crosses

<p>Few cases have been more powerful in producing mistakes in ancient
history, than the idea, hastily taken by Christians in all ages, that
every monument of antiquity marked with a cross, or with any of those
symbols which they conceived to be monograms of their god, was of
Christian origin. The early Christians did not adopt it as one of their
symbols; it was not until Christianity began to be paganized that it
became a Christian monogram, and even then it was not the cross as we
know it to-day. "It is not until the middle of the <i>fifth</i> century that
the pure form of the cross emerges to light."<a name="FNanchor_349:8_1909" id="FNanchor_349:8_1909"></a><a href="#Footnote_349:8_1909" class="fnanchor">[349:8]</a> The cross of

sacred monogram. <a href="#Fig_30">Fig. No. 30</a> is a representation of the Labarum, taken
from Smith's Dictionary of the Bible. The author of "The History of Our

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It would be difficult to prove that the cross of Constantine
was of the simple construction as now understood. As regards

<p>Now, this so-called monogram of Christ, like everything else called
Christian, is of Pagan origin. It was the monogram of the Egyptian
Saviour, Osiris, and also of Jupiter Ammon.<a name="FNanchor_350:2_1912" id="FNanchor_350:2_1912"></a><a href="#Footnote_350:2_1912" class="fnanchor">[350:2]</a> As M. Basnage remarks

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Nothing can be more opposite to Jesus Christ, than the Oracle

<p>Rev. J. P. Lundy says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Even the P.X., which I had thought to be exclusively

<p>The cross, which was so universally adored, in its different forms among

<p>As with the cross, and the X. P., so likewise with many other so-called
Christian symbols&mdash;they are borrowed from Paganism. Among these may be
mentioned the mystical three letters I. H. S., to this day retained in
some of our Protestant, as well as Roman Catholic churches, and falsely
supposed to stand for "<i>Jesu Hominium Salvator</i>," or "In Hoc Signo." It
is none other than the identical monogram of the heathen god

<p>The <span class="smcap">Triangle</span>, which is to be seen at the present day in Christian
churches as an emblem of the "Ever-blessed Trinity," is also of Pagan
origin, and was used by them for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Among the numerous symbols, the Triangle is conspicuous in <i>India</i>.
Hindoos attached a mystic signification to its <i>three</i> sides, and
generally placed it in their temples. It was often composed of lotus
plants, with an eye in the center.<a name="FNanchor_351:12_1927" id="FNanchor_351:12_1927"></a><a href="#Footnote_351:12_1927" class="fnanchor">[351:12]</a> It was sometimes represented

<p>This symbol was engraved upon the tablet of the ring which the religious
chief, called the <i>Brahm-&acirc;tma</i> wore, as one of the signs of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>his

<p>Mr. Bonwick says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>Triangle</i> was a religious form from the first. It is to
be recognized in the Obelisk and Pyramid (of Egypt). To this
day, in some Christian churches, the priest's blessing is

fingers and a thumb. An Egyptian god is seen with a triangle
over his shoulders. This figure, in ancient Egyptian theology,

<p>One of the most conspicuous among the symbols intended to represent the
Trinity, to be seen in Christian churches, is the compound leaf of the
<i>trefoil</i>. Modern story had attributed to St. Patrick the idea of
demonstrating a trinity in unity, by showing the <i>shamrock</i> to his
hearers; but, says Dr. Inman, "like many other things attributed to the
moderns, the idea belongs to the ancients."<a name="FNanchor_352:7_1936" id="FNanchor_352:7_1936"></a><a href="#Footnote_352:7_1936" class="fnanchor">[352:7]</a></p>

to be found among the Pagan symbols or representations of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>the

was to them an emblem of the mysterious <i>three in one</i>.<a name="FNanchor_353:4_1940" id="FNanchor_353:4_1940"></a><a href="#Footnote_353:4_1940" class="fnanchor">[353:4]</a> It is to

<p>The <i>Tripod</i> was very generally employed among the ancients as an emblem
of the <i>Trinity</i>, and is found composed in an endless variety of ways.
On the coins of Menecratia, in Phrygia, it is represented between two
asterisks, with a serpent wreathed around a battle-axe, inserted into
it, as an accessory symbol, signifying preservation and destruction. In
the ceremonial of worship, the number <i>three</i> was employed with mystic
solemnity.<a name="FNanchor_353:6_1942" id="FNanchor_353:6_1942"></a><a href="#Footnote_353:6_1942" class="fnanchor">[353:6]</a></p>

<p>The three lines, or three human legs, springing from a central disk or
circle, which has been called a <i>Trinacria</i>, and supposed to allude to
the island of Sicily, is simply an ancient emblem of the <i>Trinity</i>. "It
is of <i>Asiatic</i> origin; its earliest appearance being upon the very
ancient coins of Aspendus in Pamphylia; sometimes alone in the square
incuse, and sometimes upon the body of an eagle or the back of a
lion."<a name="FNanchor_353:7_1943" id="FNanchor_353:7_1943"></a><a href="#Footnote_353:7_1943" class="fnanchor">[353:7]</a></p>

<p>We have already seen, in the chapter on the <i>crucifixion</i>, that the
earliest emblems of the Christian Saviour were the "Good Shepherd" and
the "Lamb." Among these may also be mentioned the <i>Fish</i>. "The only
satisfactory explanation why Jesus should be represented as a <i>Fish</i>,"
says Mr. King, in his Gnostics and their Remains,<a name="FNanchor_353:8_1944" id="FNanchor_353:8_1944"></a><a href="#Footnote_353:8_1944" class="fnanchor">[353:8]</a> "seems to be
the circumstance that in the quaint jargon of the Talmud the Messiah is
often designated 'Dag,' or 'The Fish;'" and Mr. Lundy, in his
"Monumental Christianity," says:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"Next to the sacred monogram (the <img src="images/monogram1_pg350.png" class="letter" alt="P.X. symbol" />) the <i>Fish</i>
takes its place in importance as a sign of Christ in his
special office of <i>Saviour</i>." "In the Talmud the Messiah is
called 'Dag' or 'Fish.'" "Where did the Jews learn to apply
'Dag' to their Messiah? And why did the primitive Christians
adopt it as a sign of Christ?" "I cannot disguise facts. Truth
demands no concealment or apology. <i>Paganism</i> has its types
and prophecies of Christ as well as Judaism. What then is the
Dag-on of the old Babylonians? The <i>fish</i>-god or being that
taught them all their civilization."<a name="FNanchor_354:1_1945" id="FNanchor_354:1_1945"></a><a href="#Footnote_354:1_1945" class="fnanchor">[354:1]</a></p></div>

<p>As Mr. Lundy says, "truth demands no concealment or apology," therefore,
when the truth is exposed, we find that <i>Vishnu</i>, the Hindoo Messiah,
Preserver, Mediator and <i>Saviour</i>, was represented as a "dag," or fish.
The <i>Fish</i> takes its place in importance as a sign of <i>Vishnu</i> in his
special office of <i>Saviour</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Prof. Monier Williams says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is as <i>Vishnu</i> that the Supreme Being, according to the
Hindoos, exhibited his sympathy with human trials, his love
for the human race. Nine principal occasions have already
occurred in which the god has thus interposed for the
salvation of his creatures. The first was <i>Matsaya</i>, the
<i>Fish</i>. In this Vishnu became a fish to save the seventh Manu,
the progenitor of the human race, from the universal
deluge."<a name="FNanchor_354:2_1946" id="FNanchor_354:2_1946"></a><a href="#Footnote_354:2_1946" class="fnanchor">[354:2]</a></p></div>

<p>We have already seen, in <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">Chap. IX.</a>, the identity of the Hindoo <i>Matsaya</i>
and the Babylonian Dagon.</p>

<p>The fish was sacred among the Babylonians, Assyrians and Phenicians, as
it is among the Romanists of to-day. It was sacred also to <i>Venus</i>, and
the Romanists still eat it on the very day of the week which was called
"<i>Dies veneris</i>," Venus' day; fish day.<a name="FNanchor_354:3_1947" id="FNanchor_354:3_1947"></a><a href="#Footnote_354:3_1947" class="fnanchor">[354:3]</a> It was an emblem of
<i>fecundity</i>. The most ancient symbol of the productive power was a fish,
and it is accordingly found to be the universal symbol upon many of the
earliest coins.<a name="FNanchor_354:4_1948" id="FNanchor_354:4_1948"></a><a href="#Footnote_354:4_1948" class="fnanchor">[354:4]</a> Pythagoras and his followers did not eat fish.
They were ascetics, and the eating of fish was supposed to tend to
carnal desires. This ancient superstition is entertained by many even at
the present day.</p>

<p>The fish was the earliest symbol of Christ Jesus. Fig. No. 33 is a
design from the catacombs.<a name="FNanchor_354:5_1949" id="FNanchor_354:5_1949"></a><a href="#Footnote_354:5_1949" class="fnanchor">[354:5]</a> This cross-fish is not unlike the
sacred monogram.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p><p>That the Christian Saviour should be called a fish may at first appear
strange, but when the mythos is properly understood (as we shall
endeavor to make it in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXXIX">Chap. XXXIX.</a>), it will not appear so. The Rev.
Dr. Geikie, in his "Life and Words of Christ," says that a fish stood
for his <i>name</i>, from the significance of the Greek letters in the word
that expresses the idea, and for this reason he was called a fish. But,
we may ask, why was Buddha not only called Fo, or Po, but <i>Dag-Po</i>,
which was literally the Fish Po, or Fish Buddha? The fish did not stand
for his name. The idea that Jesus was called a fish because the Messiah
is designated "Dag" in the Talmud, is also an unsatisfactory
explanation.</p>

<p>Julius Africanus (an early Christian writer) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Christ is the great Fish taken by the fish-hook of God, and
whose flesh nourishes the whole world."<a name="FNanchor_355:1_1950" id="FNanchor_355:1_1950"></a><a href="#Footnote_355:1_1950" class="fnanchor">[355:1]</a></p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The fish fried<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Was Christ that died,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is an old couplet.<a name="FNanchor_355:2_1951" id="FNanchor_355:2_1951"></a><a href="#Footnote_355:2_1951" class="fnanchor">[355:2]</a></p>

<p>Prosper Africanus calls Christ,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The great fish who satisfied for himself the disciples on the
shore, and offered himself as a fish to the whole
world."<a name="FNanchor_355:3_1952" id="FNanchor_355:3_1952"></a><a href="#Footnote_355:3_1952" class="fnanchor">[355:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The <i>Serpent</i> was also an emblem of Christ Jesus, or in other words,
represented Christ, among some of the early Christians.</p>

<p>Moses <i>set up</i> a brazen <i>serpent</i> in the wilderness, and Christian
divines have seen in this a type of Christ Jesus. Indeed, the Gospels
sanction this; for it is written:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the
Son of man be lifted up."</p></div>

<p>From this serpent, Tertullian asserts, the early sect of Christians
called <i>Ophites</i> took their rise. Epiphanius says, that the "Ophites
sprung out of the Nicolaitans and Gnostics, who were so called from the
<i>serpent</i>, which they worshiped." "The Gnostics," he adds, "<i>taught that
the ruler of the world was of a dracontic form</i>." The Ophites preserved
live serpents in their sacred chest, and looked upon them as the
<i>mediator</i> between them and God. Manes, in the third century, taught
serpent worship in Asia Minor, under the name of Christianity,
promulgating that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Christ was an incarnation of the Great Serpent, who glided
over the cradle of the Virgin Mary, when she was asleep, at
the age of a year and a half.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_355:4_1953" id="FNanchor_355:4_1953"></a><a href="#Footnote_355:4_1953" class="fnanchor">[355:4]</a></p></div>

<p>"The Gnostics," says Irenaeus, "represented the Mind (the Son, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>the
Wisdom) in the form of a serpent," and "the Ophites," says Epiphanius,
"have a veneration for the serpent; they esteem him the same as Christ."
"They even quote the Gospels," says Tertullian, "to prove that Christ
was an imitation of the serpent."<a name="FNanchor_356:1_1954" id="FNanchor_356:1_1954"></a><a href="#Footnote_356:1_1954" class="fnanchor">[356:1]</a></p>

<p>The question now arises, Why was the Christian Saviour represented as a
serpent? Simply because the heathen Saviours were represented in like
manner.</p>

<p>From the earliest times of which we have any historical notice, the
serpent has been connected with the preserving gods, or Saviours; the
gods of goodness and of wisdom. In Hindoo mythology, the serpent is
intimately associated with Vishnu, the preserving god, the
Saviour.<a name="FNanchor_356:2_1955" id="FNanchor_356:2_1955"></a><a href="#Footnote_356:2_1955" class="fnanchor">[356:2]</a> Serpents are often associated with the Hindoo gods, as
emblems of eternity.<a name="FNanchor_356:3_1956" id="FNanchor_356:3_1956"></a><a href="#Footnote_356:3_1956" class="fnanchor">[356:3]</a> It was a very sacred animal among the
Hindoos.<a name="FNanchor_356:4_1957" id="FNanchor_356:4_1957"></a><a href="#Footnote_356:4_1957" class="fnanchor">[356:4]</a></p>

<p>Worshipers of Buddha venerate serpents. "This animal," says Mr. Wake,
"became equal in importance as Buddha himself." And Mr. Lillie says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That God was worshiped at an early date by the Buddhists
under the symbol of the <i>Serpent</i> is proved from the
sculptures of oldest topes, where worshipers are represented
so doing."<a name="FNanchor_356:5_1958" id="FNanchor_356:5_1958"></a><a href="#Footnote_356:5_1958" class="fnanchor">[356:5]</a></p></div>

<p>The Egyptians also venerated the serpent. It was the special symbol of
Thoth, a primeval deity of Syro-Egyptian mythology, and of all those
gods, such as Hermes and Seth, who can be connected with him.<a name="FNanchor_356:6_1959" id="FNanchor_356:6_1959"></a><a href="#Footnote_356:6_1959" class="fnanchor">[356:6]</a>
Kneph and Apap were also represented as serpents.<a name="FNanchor_356:7_1960" id="FNanchor_356:7_1960"></a><a href="#Footnote_356:7_1960" class="fnanchor">[356:7]</a></p>

<p>Herodotus, when he visited Egypt, found sacred serpents in the temples.
Speaking of them, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the neighborhood of Thebes, there are sacred serpents, not
at all hurtful to men: they are diminutive in size, and carry
two horns that grow on the top of the head. When these
serpents die, they bury them in the temple of Jupiter; for
they say they are sacred to that god."<a name="FNanchor_356:8_1961" id="FNanchor_356:8_1961"></a><a href="#Footnote_356:8_1961" class="fnanchor">[356:8]</a></p></div>

<p>The third member of the Chaldean triad, H&eacute;a, or Hoa, was represented by
a serpent. According to Sir Henry Rawlinson, the most important titles
of this deity refer "to his functions as the source of all knowledge and
science." Not only is he "The Intelligent Fish," but his name may be
read as signifying both "Life" and a "Serpent," and he may be considered
as "figured by the great serpent which occupies so conspicuous a place
among the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>symbols of the gods on the black stones recording Babylonian
benefactors."<a name="FNanchor_357:1_1962" id="FNanchor_357:1_1962"></a><a href="#Footnote_357:1_1962" class="fnanchor">[357:1]</a></p>

<p>The Phenicians and other eastern nations venerated the serpent as
symbols of their beneficent gods.<a name="FNanchor_357:2_1963" id="FNanchor_357:2_1963"></a><a href="#Footnote_357:2_1963" class="fnanchor">[357:2]</a></p>

<p>As god of medicine, Apollo, the central figure in Grecian mythology, was
originally worshiped under the form of a serpent, and men invoked him as
the "Helper." He was the Solar Serpent-god.<a name="FNanchor_357:3_1964" id="FNanchor_357:3_1964"></a><a href="#Footnote_357:3_1964" class="fnanchor">[357:3]</a></p>

<p>&AElig;sculapius, the healing god, the Saviour, was also worshiped under the
form of a serpent.<a name="FNanchor_357:4_1965" id="FNanchor_357:4_1965"></a><a href="#Footnote_357:4_1965" class="fnanchor">[357:4]</a> "Throughout Hellas," says Mr. Cox, "&AElig;sculapius
remained the 'Healer,' and the 'Restorer of Life,' and accordingly the
serpent is everywhere his special emblem."<a name="FNanchor_357:5_1966" id="FNanchor_357:5_1966"></a><a href="#Footnote_357:5_1966" class="fnanchor">[357:5]</a></p>

<p>Why the serpent was the symbol of the Saviours and beneficent gods of
antiquity, will be explained in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXXIX">Chap. XXXIX</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Dove</i>, among the Christians, is the symbol of the Holy Spirit. The
Matthew narrator relates that when Jesus went up out of the water, after
being baptized by John, "the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw
the Spirit of God descending like a <i>dove</i>, and lighting upon him."</p>

<p>Here is another piece of Paganism, as we find that the <i>Dove</i> was the
symbol of the Holy Spirit among all nations of antiquity. Rev. J. P.
Lundy, speaking of this, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is a remarkable fact that this spirit (<i>i. e.</i>, the Holy
Spirit) has been symbolized among all religious and civilized
nations by the <i>Dove</i>."<a name="FNanchor_357:6_1967" id="FNanchor_357:6_1967"></a><a href="#Footnote_357:6_1967" class="fnanchor">[357:6]</a></p></div>

<p>And Earnest De Bunsen says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The symbol of the Spirit of God was the <i>Dove</i>, in Greek,
<i>peleia</i>, and the Samaritans had a brazen fiery dove, instead
of the brazen fiery serpent. Both referred to fire, the symbol
of the Holy Ghost."<a name="FNanchor_357:7_1968" id="FNanchor_357:7_1968"></a><a href="#Footnote_357:7_1968" class="fnanchor">[357:7]</a></p></div>

<p>Buddha is represented, like Christ Jesus, with a dove hovering over his
head.<a name="FNanchor_357:8_1969" id="FNanchor_357:8_1969"></a><a href="#Footnote_357:8_1969" class="fnanchor">[357:8]</a></p>

<p>The virgin goddess Juno is often represented with a dove on her head. It
is also seen on the heads of the images of Astarte, Cybele, and Isis; it
was sacred to Venus, and was intended as a symbol of the Holy
Spirit.<a name="FNanchor_357:9_1970" id="FNanchor_357:9_1970"></a><a href="#Footnote_357:9_1970" class="fnanchor">[357:9]</a></p>

<p>Even in the remote islands of the Pacific Ocean, a <i>bird</i> is believed to
be an emblem of the Holy Spirit.<a name="FNanchor_357:10_1971" id="FNanchor_357:10_1971"></a><a href="#Footnote_357:10_1971" class="fnanchor">[357:10]</a></p>

<p>R. Payne Knight, in speaking of the "mystic Dove," says:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"A bird was probably chosen for the emblem of the third
person (<i>i. e.</i>, the Holy Ghost) to signify incubation, by
which was figuratively expressed the fructification of inert
matter, caused by the vital spirit moving upon the waters.</p>

<p>"The <i>Dove</i> would naturally be selected in the East in
preference to every other species of bird, on account of its
domestic familiarity with man; it usually lodging under the
same roof with him, and being employed as his messenger from
one remote place to another. Birds of this kind were also
remarkable for the care of their offspring, and for a sort of
conjugal attachment and fidelity to each other, as likewise
for the peculiar fervency of their sexual desires, whence they
were sacred to Venus, and emblems of love."<a name="FNanchor_358:1_1972" id="FNanchor_358:1_1972"></a><a href="#Footnote_358:1_1972" class="fnanchor">[358:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Masons' marks are conspicuous among the Christian symbols. On some of
the most ancient Roman Catholic cathedrals are to be found figures of
Christ Jesus with Mason's marks about him.</p>

<p>Many are the so-called Christian symbols which are direct importations
from paganism. To enumerate them would take, as we have previously said,
a volume of itself. For further information on this subject the reader
is referred to Dr. Inman's "Ancient Pagan and Modern Christian
Symbolism," where he will see how many ancient Indian, Egyptian,
Etruscan, Grecian and Roman symbols have been adopted by Christians, a
great number of which are <i>Phallic</i> emblems.<a name="FNanchor_358:2_1973" id="FNanchor_358:2_1973"></a><a href="#Footnote_358:2_1973" class="fnanchor">[358:2]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<h3>THE BIRTH-DAY OF CHRIST JESUS.</h3>

<p>Christmas&mdash;December the 25th&mdash;is a day which has been set apart by the
Christian church on which to celebrate the birth of their Lord and
Saviour, Christ Jesus, and is considered by the majority of persons to
be really the day on which he was born. This is altogether erroneous, as
will be seen upon examination of the subject.</p>

<p>There was no uniformity in the period of observing the Nativity among
the early Christian churches; some held the festival in the month of May
or April, others in January.<a name="FNanchor_359:1_1974" id="FNanchor_359:1_1974"></a><a href="#Footnote_359:1_1974" class="fnanchor">[359:1]</a></p>

<p>The <i>year</i> in which he was born is also as uncertain as the month or
day. "The year in which it happened," says Mosheim, the ecclesiastical
historian, "has not hitherto been fixed with certainty, notwithstanding
the deep and laborious researches of the learned."<a name="FNanchor_359:2_1975" id="FNanchor_359:2_1975"></a><a href="#Footnote_359:2_1975" class="fnanchor">[359:2]</a></p>

<p>According to <span class="smcap">Iren&aelig;us</span> (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 190), on the authority of "The Gospel," and
"all the elders who were conversant in Asia with John, the disciple of
the Lord," Christ Jesus lived to be nearly, if not quite, <i>fifty years
of age</i>. If this celebrated Christian father is correct, and who can say
he is not, Jesus was born some twenty years before the time which has
been assigned as that of his birth.<a name="FNanchor_359:3_1976" id="FNanchor_359:3_1976"></a><a href="#Footnote_359:3_1976" class="fnanchor">[359:3]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Giles says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Concerning the <i>time</i> of Christ's birth there are even
greater doubts than about the <i>place</i>; for, though the four
Evangelists have noticed several contemporary facts, which
would seem to settle this point, yet on comparing these dates
with the general history of the period, we meet with serious
discrepancies, which involve the subject in the greatest
uncertainty."<a name="FNanchor_359:4_1977" id="FNanchor_359:4_1977"></a><a href="#Footnote_359:4_1977" class="fnanchor">[359:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Again he says:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"Not only do we date our time from the exact year in which
Christ <i>is said to have been born</i>, but our ecclesiastical
calendar has determined with scrupulous minuteness the day and
almost the hour at which every particular of Christ's
wonderful life is stated to have happened. All this is
implicitly believed by millions; <i>yet all these things are
among the most uncertain and shadowy that history has
recorded. We have no clue to either the day or the time of
year, or even the year itself, in which Christ was
born.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_360:1_1978" id="FNanchor_360:1_1978"></a><a href="#Footnote_360:1_1978" class="fnanchor">[360:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Some Christian writers fix the year 4 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, as the time when he was
born, others the year 5 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, and again others place his time of birth
at about 15 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> The Rev. Dr. Geikie, speaking of this, in his <i>Life of
Christ</i>, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The whole subject is <i>very uncertain</i>. Ewald appears to fix
the date of the birth at <i>five</i> years earlier than our era.
Petavius and Usher fix it on the 25th of December, <i>five</i>
years before our era. Bengel on the 25th of December, <i>four</i>
years before our era; Anger and Winer, <i>four</i> years before our
era, <i>in the Spring</i>; Scaliger, <i>three</i> years before our era,
in <i>October</i>; St. Jerome, <i>three</i> years before our era, on
December 25th; Eusebius, <i>two</i> years before our era, on
<i>January</i> 6th; and Idler, <i>seven</i> years before our era, in
<i>December</i>."<a name="FNanchor_360:2_1979" id="FNanchor_360:2_1979"></a><a href="#Footnote_360:2_1979" class="fnanchor">[360:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Albert Barnes writes in a manner which implies that he knew all about
the <i>year</i> (although he does not give any authorities), but knew nothing
about the <i>month</i>. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The birth of Christ took place <i>four</i> years before the common
era. That era began to be used about <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 526, being first
employed by Dionysius, and is supposed to have been placed
about four years too late. Some make the difference two,
others three, four, five, and even eight years. He was born at
the commencement of the last year of the reign of Herod, or at
the close of the year preceding."<a name="FNanchor_360:3_1980" id="FNanchor_360:3_1980"></a><a href="#Footnote_360:3_1980" class="fnanchor">[360:3]</a></p>

<p>"The Jews sent out their flocks into the mountainous and
desert regions during the summer months, and took them up in
the latter part of October or the first of November, when the
cold weather commenced.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is clear from this that our
Saviour was born before the 25th of December, or before what
we call <i>Christmas</i>. At that time it is cold, and especially
in the high and mountainous regions about Bethlehem. <i>God has
concealed the time of his birth. There is no way to ascertain
it.</i> By different learned men it has been fixed at each month
in the year."<a name="FNanchor_360:4_1981" id="FNanchor_360:4_1981"></a><a href="#Footnote_360:4_1981" class="fnanchor">[360:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Canon Farrar writes with a little more caution, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Although the date of Christ's birth cannot be fixed with
absolute certainty, there is at least a large amount of
evidence to render it <i>probable</i> that he was born <i>four</i> years
before our present era. It is universally admitted that our
received chronology, which is not older than Dionysius
<ins class="corr" title="[original Exignus]">Exiguus</ins>, in the sixth century, is wrong. But all attempts to
discover the <i>month</i> and the <i>day</i> are useless. No data
whatever exists to enable us to determine them with even
approximate accuracy."<a name="FNanchor_360:5_1982" id="FNanchor_360:5_1982"></a><a href="#Footnote_360:5_1982" class="fnanchor">[360:5]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p><p>Bunsen attempts to show (on the authority of <i>Iren&aelig;us</i>, above quoted),
that Jesus was born some <i>fifteen</i> years before the time assigned, and
that he lived to be nearly, if not quite, fifty years of age.<a name="FNanchor_361:1_1983" id="FNanchor_361:1_1983"></a><a href="#Footnote_361:1_1983" class="fnanchor">[361:1]</a></p>

<p>According to Basnage,<a name="FNanchor_361:2_1984" id="FNanchor_361:2_1984"></a><a href="#Footnote_361:2_1984" class="fnanchor">[361:2]</a> the Jews placed his birth near a century
sooner than the generally assumed epoch. Others have placed it even in
the <i>third century</i> <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> This belief is founded on a passage in the
"<i>Book of Wisdom</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_361:3_1985" id="FNanchor_361:3_1985"></a><a href="#Footnote_361:3_1985" class="fnanchor">[361:3]</a> written about 250 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, which is supposed to
refer to Christ <i>Jesus</i>, and none other. In speaking of some individual
who lived <i>at that time</i>, it says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He professeth to have the knowledge of God, and he calleth
himself <i>the child of the Lord</i>. He was made to reprove our
thoughts. He is grievous unto us even to behold; for his life
is not like other men's, his ways are of another fashion. We
are esteemed of him as counterfeits; he abstaineth from our
ways as from filthiness; he pronounceth the end of the just to
be blessed, <i>and maketh his boast that God is his father</i>. Let
us see if his words be true; and let us prove what shall
happen in the end of him. For if the <i>just man</i> be the son of
God, he (God) will help him, and deliver him from the hand of
his enemies. Let us examine him with despitefulness and
torture, that we may know his meekness, and prove his
patience. Let us condemn him with a shameful death; for by his
own saying he shall be respected."</p></div>

<p>This is a very important passage. Of course, the church claim it to be a
<i>prophecy</i> of what Christ Jesus was to do and suffer, but this does not
explain it.</p>

<p>If the writer of the "<i>Gospel according to Luke</i>" is correct, Jesus was
not born until about <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 10, for he explicitly tells us that this
event did not happen until Cyrenius was governor of Syria.<a name="FNanchor_361:4_1986" id="FNanchor_361:4_1986"></a><a href="#Footnote_361:4_1986" class="fnanchor">[361:4]</a> Now it
is well known that Cyrenius was not appointed to this office until long
after the death of Herod (during whose reign the Matthew narrator
informs us Jesus was born<a name="FNanchor_361:5_1987" id="FNanchor_361:5_1987"></a><a href="#Footnote_361:5_1987" class="fnanchor">[361:5]</a>), and that the taxing spoken of by the
Luke narrator as having taken place at this time, did not take place
until about ten years after the time at which, according to the Matthew
narrator, Jesus was born.<a name="FNanchor_361:6_1988" id="FNanchor_361:6_1988"></a><a href="#Footnote_361:6_1988" class="fnanchor">[361:6]</a></p>

<p>Eusebius, the first ecclesiastical historian,<a name="FNanchor_361:7_1989" id="FNanchor_361:7_1989"></a><a href="#Footnote_361:7_1989" class="fnanchor">[361:7]</a> places his birth at
the time Cyrenius was governor of Syria, and therefore at about <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span>
10. His words are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was the two and fortieth year after the reign of Augustus
the Emperor, and the eight and twentieth year after the
subduing of Egypt, and the death of Antonius and Cleopatra,
when last of all the Ptolemies in Egypt ceased to bear <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>rule,
when our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ, at the time of the
first taxing&mdash;Cyrenius, then President of Syria&mdash;was born in
Bethlehem, a city of Judea, according unto the prophecies in
that behalf premised."<a name="FNanchor_362:1_1990" id="FNanchor_362:1_1990"></a><a href="#Footnote_362:1_1990" class="fnanchor">[362:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Had the Luke narrator known anything about Jewish history, he never
would have made so gross a blunder as to place the taxing of Cyrenius in
the days of Herod, and would have saved the immense amount of labor that
it has taken in endeavoring to explain away the effects of his
ignorance. One explanation of this mistake is, that there were <i>two</i>
assessments, one about the time Jesus was born, and the other ten years
after; but this has entirely failed. Dr. Hooykaas, speaking of this,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Evangelist (Luke) falls into the most extraordinary
mistakes throughout. In the first place, history is silent as
to a census of the whole (Roman) world ever having been made
at all. In the next place, though Quirinius certainly did make
such a register in Judea and Samaria, it did not extend to
Galilee; so that Joseph's household was not affected by it.
Besides, <i>it did not take place until ten years after the
death of Herod</i>, when his son Archelaus was deposed by the
emperor, and the districts of Judea and Samaria were thrown
into a Roman province. Under the reign of Herod, nothing of
the kind took place, nor was there any occasion for it.
Finally, at the time of the birth of Jesus, the Governor of
Syria was not Quirinius, but Quintus Sentius
Saturninus."<a name="FNanchor_362:2_1991" id="FNanchor_362:2_1991"></a><a href="#Footnote_362:2_1991" class="fnanchor">[362:2]</a></p></div>

<p>The institution of the festival of the Nativity of Christ Jesus being
held on the 25th of December, among the Christians, is attributed to
Telesphorus, who flourished during the reign of Antonius Pius (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span>
138-161), but the first <i>certain</i> traces of it are found about the time
of the Emperor Commodus (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 180-192).<a name="FNanchor_362:3_1992" id="FNanchor_362:3_1992"></a><a href="#Footnote_362:3_1992" class="fnanchor">[362:3]</a></p>

<p>For a long time the Christians had been trying to discover upon what
particular day Jesus had possibly or probably come into the world; and
conjectures and traditions that rested upon absolutely no foundation,
led one to the 20th of May, another to the 19th or 20th of April, and a
third to the 5th of January. At last the opinion of the <i>community at
Rome</i> gained the upper hand, and the 25th of December was fixed
upon.<a name="FNanchor_362:4_1993" id="FNanchor_362:4_1993"></a><a href="#Footnote_362:4_1993" class="fnanchor">[362:4]</a> It was not until the <i>fifth</i> century, however, that this
day had been <i>generally</i> agreed upon.<a name="FNanchor_362:5_1994" id="FNanchor_362:5_1994"></a><a href="#Footnote_362:5_1994" class="fnanchor">[362:5]</a> <i>How it happened</i> that this
day finally became fixed as the birthday of Christ Jesus, may be
inferred from what we shall now see.</p>

<p>On the first moment after midnight of the 24th of December (<i>i. e.</i>, on
the morning of the 25th), nearly all the nations of the earth, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>as if by
common consent, celebrated the accouchement of the "<i>Queen of Heaven</i>,"
of the "<i>Celestial Virgin</i>" of the sphere, and the birth of the god
<i>Sol</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>India</i> this is a period of rejoicing everywhere.<a name="FNanchor_363:1_1995" id="FNanchor_363:1_1995"></a><a href="#Footnote_363:1_1995" class="fnanchor">[363:1]</a> It is a
great religious festival, and the people <i>decorate their houses with

<p>In <i>China</i>, religious solemnities are celebrated at the time of the

<p><i>Buddha</i>, the son of the Virgin M&acirc;ya, on whom, according to Chinese
tradition, "the Holy Ghost" had descended, was said to have been born on
Christmas day, December 25th.<a name="FNanchor_363:4_1998" id="FNanchor_363:4_1998"></a><a href="#Footnote_363:4_1998" class="fnanchor">[363:4]</a></p>

<p>Among the ancient <i>Persians</i> their most splendid ceremonials were in
honor of their Lord and Saviour <i>Mithras</i>; they kept his birthday, with
many rejoicings, on the 25th of December.</p>

<p>The author of the "<i>Celtic Druids</i>" says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was the custom of the heathen, long before the birth of
Christ, to celebrate the birth-day of their gods," and that,
"the 25th of December was a great festival with the
<i>Persians</i>, who, in very early times, celebrated the birth of
their god <i>Mithras</i>."<a name="FNanchor_363:5_1999" id="FNanchor_363:5_1999"></a><a href="#Footnote_363:5_1999" class="fnanchor">[363:5]</a></p></div>

<p>The Rev. Joseph B. Gross, in his "<i>Heathen Religion</i>," also tells us
that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The ancient Persians celebrated a festival in honor of
<i>Mithras</i> on the first day succeeding the <i>Winter Solstice</i>,
the object of which was to <i>commemorate the Birth of
Mithras</i>."<a name="FNanchor_363:6_2000" id="FNanchor_363:6_2000"></a><a href="#Footnote_363:6_2000" class="fnanchor">[363:6]</a></p></div>

<p>Among the ancient <i>Egyptians</i>, for centuries before the time of Christ
Jesus, the 25th of December was set aside as the birthday of their gods.
M. Le Clerk De Septchenes speaks of it as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The ancient Egyptians fixed the pregnancy of <i>Isis</i> (the
<i>Queen of Heaven</i>, and the <i>Virgin Mother</i> of the Saviour
Horus), on the last days of March, and towards the end of
<i>December</i> they placed the commemoration of her
delivery."<a name="FNanchor_363:7_2001" id="FNanchor_363:7_2001"></a><a href="#Footnote_363:7_2001" class="fnanchor">[363:7]</a></p></div>

<p>Mr. Bonwick, in speaking of <i>Horus</i>, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He is the great God-loved of Heaven. His birth was one of the
greatest mysteries of the Egyptian religion. Pictures
representing it appeared on the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>walls of temples. One passed
through the holy <i>Adytum</i><a name="FNanchor_364:1_2002" id="FNanchor_364:1_2002"></a><a href="#Footnote_364:1_2002" class="fnanchor">[364:1]</a> to the still more sacred
quarter of the temple known as the birth-place of Horus. He
was presumably the child of Deity. <i>At Christmas time</i>, or
that answering to our festival, his image was brought out of
that sanctuary with peculiar ceremonies, as the image of the
infant <i>Bambino</i><a name="FNanchor_364:2_2003" id="FNanchor_364:2_2003"></a><a href="#Footnote_364:2_2003" class="fnanchor">[364:2]</a> is still brought out and exhibited in
Rome."<a name="FNanchor_364:3_2004" id="FNanchor_364:3_2004"></a><a href="#Footnote_364:3_2004" class="fnanchor">[364:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Rigord observes that the Egyptians not only worshiped a <i>Virgin Mother</i>
"prior to the birth of our Saviour, but exhibited the effigy of her son
lying in the manger, in the manner the infant Jesus was afterwards laid
in the cave at Bethlehem."<a name="FNanchor_364:4_2005" id="FNanchor_364:4_2005"></a><a href="#Footnote_364:4_2005" class="fnanchor">[364:4]</a></p>

<p>The "Chronicles of Alexandria," an ancient Christian work, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Watch how Egypt has constructed the childbirth of a Virgin,
and the birth of her son, <i>who was exposed in a crib to the
adoration of the people</i>."<a name="FNanchor_364:5_2006" id="FNanchor_364:5_2006"></a><a href="#Footnote_364:5_2006" class="fnanchor">[364:5]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Osiris</i>, son of the "<i>Holy Virgin</i>," as they called Ceres, or Neith,
his mother, was born on the 25th of December.<a name="FNanchor_364:6_2007" id="FNanchor_364:6_2007"></a><a href="#Footnote_364:6_2007" class="fnanchor">[364:6]</a></p>

<p>This was also the time celebrated by the ancient <i>Greeks</i> as being the
birthday of <i>Hercules</i>. The author of "<i>The Religion of the Ancient
Greeks</i>" says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The night of the <i>Winter Solstice</i>, which the Greeks named
the triple night, was that which they thought gave birth to
<i>Hercules</i>."<a name="FNanchor_364:7_2008" id="FNanchor_364:7_2008"></a><a href="#Footnote_364:7_2008" class="fnanchor">[364:7]</a></p></div>

<p>He further says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It has become an epoch of singular importance in the eyes of
the Christian, who has destined it to celebrate the birth of
the Saviour, the <i>true</i> Sun of Justice, who alone came to
dissipate the darkness of ignorance."<a name="FNanchor_364:8_2009" id="FNanchor_364:8_2009"></a><a href="#Footnote_364:8_2009" class="fnanchor">[364:8]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Bacchus</i>, also, was born at early dawn on the 25th of December. Mr.
Higgins says of him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The birth-place of Bacchus, called Sabizius or Sabaoth, was
claimed by several places in Greece; but on Mount Zelmissus,
in Thrace, his worship seems to have been chiefly celebrated.
He was born of a virgin on the 25th of December, and was
always called the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>. In his Mysteries, he was shown to
the people, as an infant is by the Christians at this day, on
Christmas-day morning, in Rome."<a name="FNanchor_364:9_2010" id="FNanchor_364:9_2010"></a><a href="#Footnote_364:9_2010" class="fnanchor">[364:9]</a></p></div>

<p>The birthday of <i>Adonis</i> was celebrated on the 25th of December. This
celebration is spoken of by Tertullian, Jerome, and other <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>Fathers of
the Church,<a name="FNanchor_365:1_2011" id="FNanchor_365:1_2011"></a><a href="#Footnote_365:1_2011" class="fnanchor">[365:1]</a> who inform us that the ceremonies took place in a
cave, and that the cave in which they celebrated his mysteries in
Bethlehem, was that in which Christ Jesus was born.</p>

<p>This was also a great holy day in ancient Rome. The Rev. Mr. Gross says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In <i>Rome</i>, before the time of Christ, a festival was observed
on the 25th of December, under the name of '<i>Natalis Solis
Invicti</i>' (Birthday of Sol the Invincible). It was a day of
universal rejoicings, illustrated by illuminations and public
games."<a name="FNanchor_365:2_2012" id="FNanchor_365:2_2012"></a><a href="#Footnote_365:2_2012" class="fnanchor">[365:2]</a> "All public business was suspended,
declarations of war and criminal executions were postponed,
<i>friends made presents to one another</i>, and the slaves were
indulged with great liberties."<a name="FNanchor_365:3_2013" id="FNanchor_365:3_2013"></a><a href="#Footnote_365:3_2013" class="fnanchor">[365:3]</a></p></div>

<p>A few weeks before the winter solstice, the Calabrian shepherds came
into Rome to play on the pipes. Ovid alludes to this when he says:</p>

<table summary="Ovid's Epist. i. l. ii." style="margin-left: 10%;" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdleft">"Ante De&ucirc;m matrem cornu tibicen adunco<br />
     <span style="padding-left: .25em;">Cum canit, exigu&aelig; quis stipis aera neget."</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdright" colspan="2" style="padding-left: 15em;">&mdash;(Epist. i. l. ii.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdlt"><i>i. e.</i>,</td>
  <td class="tdleft">"When to the mighty mother pipes the swain,<br />
     <span style="padding-left: .25em;">Grudge not a trifle for his pious strain."</span></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This practice is kept up to the present day.</p>

<p>The ancient <i>Germans</i>, for centuries before "the <i>true</i> Sun of Justice"
was ever heard of, celebrated annually, at the time of the <i>Winter
solstice</i>, what they called their Yule-feast. At this feast agreements
were renewed, the gods were consulted as to the future, sacrifices were
made to them, and the time was spent in jovial hospitality. Many
features of this festival, such as burning the yule-log on
Christmas-eve, still survive among us.<a name="FNanchor_365:4_2014" id="FNanchor_365:4_2014"></a><a href="#Footnote_365:4_2014" class="fnanchor">[365:4]</a></p>

<p><i>Yule</i> was the old name for Christmas. In French it is called <i>Noel</i>,
which is the Hebrew or Chaldee word <i>Nule</i>.<a name="FNanchor_365:5_2015" id="FNanchor_365:5_2015"></a><a href="#Footnote_365:5_2015" class="fnanchor">[365:5]</a></p>

<p>The greatest festival of the year celebrated among the ancient
<i>Scandinavians</i>, was at the <i>Winter solstice</i>. They called the night
upon which it was observed, the "<i>Mother-night</i>." This feast was named
<i>Jul</i>&mdash;hence is derived the word <i>Yule</i>&mdash;and was celebrated in honor of
<i>Freyr</i> (son of the Supreme God Odin, and the goddess Frigga), who was
born on that day. Feasting, nocturnal assemblies, and all the
demonstrations of a most dissolute joy, were then authorized by the
general usage. At this festival the principal guests <i>received
presents</i>&mdash;generally horses, swords, battle-axes, and gold rings&mdash;at
their departure.<a name="FNanchor_365:6_2016" id="FNanchor_365:6_2016"></a><a href="#Footnote_365:6_2016" class="fnanchor">[365:6]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p><p>The festival of the 25th of December was celebrated by the ancient
<i>Druids</i>, in Great Britain and Ireland, with great fires lighted on the
tops of hills.<a name="FNanchor_366:1_2017" id="FNanchor_366:1_2017"></a><a href="#Footnote_366:1_2017" class="fnanchor">[366:1]</a></p>

<p>Godfrey Higgins says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Stuckley observes that the worship of Mithra was spread all
over Gaul and Britain. The Druids kept this night as a great
festival, and called the day following it Nolagh or Noel, or
the day of regeneration, and celebrated it with great fires on
the tops of their mountains, which they repeated on the day of
the Epiphany or twelfth night. The Mithraic monuments, which
are common in Britain, have been attributed to the Romans, but
this festival proves that the Mithraic worship was there prior
to their arrival."<a name="FNanchor_366:2_2018" id="FNanchor_366:2_2018"></a><a href="#Footnote_366:2_2018" class="fnanchor">[366:2]</a></p></div>

<p>This was also a time of rejoicing in Ancient Mexico. Acosta says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the first month, which in Peru they call Rayme, and
answering to our <i>December</i>, they made a solemn feast called
<i>Capacrayme</i> (the Winter Solstice), wherein they made many
sacrifices and ceremonies, which continued many days."<a name="FNanchor_366:3_2019" id="FNanchor_366:3_2019"></a><a href="#Footnote_366:3_2019" class="fnanchor">[366:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The evergreens, and particularly the mistletoe, which are used all over
the Christian world at Christmas time, betray its heathen origin.
Tertullian, a Father of the Church, who flourished about <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 200,
writing to his brethren, affirms it to be "<i>rank idolatry</i>" to deck
their doors "<i>with garlands or flowers, on festival days, according to
the custom of the heathen</i>."<a name="FNanchor_366:4_2020" id="FNanchor_366:4_2020"></a><a href="#Footnote_366:4_2020" class="fnanchor">[366:4]</a></p>

<p>This shows that the heathen in those days, did as the Christians do now.
What have evergreens, and garlands, and Christmas trees, to do with
Christianity? Simply <i>nothing</i>. It is the old Yule-feast which was held
by all the northern nations, from time immemorial, handed down to, and
observed at the present day. In the greenery with which Christians deck
their houses and temples of worship, and in the Christmas-trees laden
with gifts, we unquestionably see a relic of the symbols by which our
heathen forefathers signified their faith in the powers of the returning
sun to clothe the earth again with green, and hang new fruit on the
trees. Foliage, such as the laurel, myrtle, ivy, or oak, and in general,
<i>all evergreens</i>, were <i>Dionysiac plants</i>, that is, symbols of the
generative power, signifying perpetuity of youth and vigor.<a name="FNanchor_366:5_2021" id="FNanchor_366:5_2021"></a><a href="#Footnote_366:5_2021" class="fnanchor">[366:5]</a></p>

<p>Among the causes, then, that co-operated in fixing this period&mdash;December
25th&mdash;as the birthday of Christ Jesus, was, as we have seen, that almost
every ancient nation of the earth held a festival on this day in
commemoration of the birth of <i>their</i> virgin-born god.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p><p>On this account the Christians <i>adopted it</i> as the time of the birth of
<i>their</i> God. Mr. Gibbon, speaking of this in his "Decline and Fall of
the Roman Empire," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Roman Christians, ignorant of the real date of his
(Christ's) birth, fixed the solemn festival to the 25th of
December, the <i>Brumalia</i>, or Winter Solstice, when the Pagans
annually celebrated the birth of <i>Sol</i>."<a name="FNanchor_367:1_2022" id="FNanchor_367:1_2022"></a><a href="#Footnote_367:1_2022" class="fnanchor">[367:1]</a></p></div>

<p>And Mr. King, in his "Gnostics and their Remains," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The ancient festival held on the 25th of December in honor of
the 'Birthday of the Invincible One,' and celebrated by the
'great games' at the circus, was afterwards transferred to the
commemoration of the birth of Christ, the precise day of which
many of the Fathers confess was then unknown."<a name="FNanchor_367:2_2023" id="FNanchor_367:2_2023"></a><a href="#Footnote_367:2_2023" class="fnanchor">[367:2]</a></p></div>

<p>St. Chrysostom, who flourished about <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 390, referring to this Pagan
festival, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>On this day, also, the birth of Christ was lately fixed at
Rome</i>, in order that whilst the heathen were busy with their
<i>profane</i> ceremonies, the Christians might perform their <i>holy
rites</i> undisturbed."<a name="FNanchor_367:3_2024" id="FNanchor_367:3_2024"></a><a href="#Footnote_367:3_2024" class="fnanchor">[367:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Add to this the fact that St. Gregory, a Christian Father of the third
century, was instrumental in, and commended by other Fathers for,
changing <i>Pagan festivals</i> into Christian <i>holidays</i>, for the purpose,
as they said, of drawing the heathen to the religion of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_367:4_2025" id="FNanchor_367:4_2025"></a><a href="#Footnote_367:4_2025" class="fnanchor">[367:4]</a></p>

<p>As Dr. Hooykaas remarks, the church was always anxious to meet the
heathen <i>half way</i>, by allowing them to retain the feasts they were
accustomed to, only giving them a <i>Christian dress</i>, or attaching a new
or Christian signification to them.<a name="FNanchor_367:5_2026" id="FNanchor_367:5_2026"></a><a href="#Footnote_367:5_2026" class="fnanchor">[367:5]</a></p>

<p>In doing these, and many other such things, which we shall speak of in
our chapter on "<i><a href="#CHAPTER_XXXVI">Paganism in Christianity</a></i>," the Christian Fathers,
instead of drawing the heathen to their religion, drew themselves into
Paganism.</p>

<h3>THE TRINITY.</h3>

<p class="center">"Say not there are three Gods, God is but One God."&mdash;(Koran.)</p>

<p class="sectctr">The doctrine of the Trinity is the highest and most mysterious doctrine
of the Christian church. It declares that there are <i>three</i> persons in
the Godhead or divine nature&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost&mdash;and that "these three are <i>one</i> true, eternal God, the same in
substance, equal in power and glory, although distinguished by their
personal propensities." The most celebrated statement of the doctrine is
to be found in the Athanasian creed,<a name="FNanchor_368:1_2027" id="FNanchor_368:1_2027"></a><a href="#Footnote_368:1_2027" class="fnanchor">[368:1]</a> which asserts that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Catholic<a name="FNanchor_368:2_2028" id="FNanchor_368:2_2028"></a><a href="#Footnote_368:2_2028" class="fnanchor">[368:2]</a> faith is this: That we worship <i>One</i> God
as Trinity, and Trinity in Unity&mdash;neither confounding the
persons, nor dividing the substance&mdash;for there is One person
of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy
Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost <i>is all one</i>; the glory equal, the majesty
co-eternal."</p></div>

<p>As M. Reville remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The dogma of the Trinity displayed its contradictions with
true bravery. The Deity divided into <i>three</i> divine persons,
<i>and yet</i> these <i>three</i> persons forming only <i>One</i> God; of
these three <i>the first only</i> being self-existent, the two
others <i>deriving their existence</i> from the first, <i>and yet</i>
these three persons being considered as <i>perfectly equal</i>;
each having his special, distinct character, his individual
qualities, wanting in the other two, <i>and yet</i> each one of the
three being supposed to possess the fullness of
perfection&mdash;here, it must be confessed, we have the
deification of the contradictory."<a name="FNanchor_368:3_2029" id="FNanchor_368:3_2029"></a><a href="#Footnote_368:3_2029" class="fnanchor">[368:3]</a></p></div>

<p>We shall now see that this very peculiar doctrine of three in one, and
one in three, is of <i>heathen</i> origin, and that it must fall with all the
other dogmas of the Christian religion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p><p>The number <i>three</i> is sacred in all theories derived from oriental
sources. Deity is always a trinity of some kind, or the successive
emanations proceeded in threes.<a name="FNanchor_369:1_2030" id="FNanchor_369:1_2030"></a><a href="#Footnote_369:1_2030" class="fnanchor">[369:1]</a></p>

<p>If we turn to <i>India</i> we shall find that one of the most prominent
features in the Indian theology is the doctrine of a divine triad,
governing all things. This triad is called <i>Tri-murti</i>&mdash;from the
Sanscrit word <i>tri</i> (three) and <i>murti</i> (form)&mdash;and consists of Brahma,
Vishnu, and Siva. It is an <i>inseparable</i> unity, though three in
form.<a name="FNanchor_369:2_2031" id="FNanchor_369:2_2031"></a><a href="#Footnote_369:2_2031" class="fnanchor">[369:2]</a></p>

<p>"When the universal and infinite being Brahma&mdash;the only really existing
entity, wholly without form, and unbound and unaffected by the three
Gunas or by qualities of any kind&mdash;wished to create for his own
entertainment the phenomena of the universe, he assumed the quality of
activity and became a male person, as <i>Brahma</i> the creator. Next, in the
progress of still further self-evolution, he willed to invest himself
with the second quality of goodness, as <i>Vishnu</i> the preserver, and with
the third quality of darkness, as <i>Siva</i> the destroyer. This development
of the doctrine of triple manifestation (<i>tri-murti</i>), which appears
first in the Brahmanized version of the Indian Epics, had already been
adumbrated in the Veda in the triple form of fire, and in the triad of
gods, Agni, S&#363;rya, and Indra; and in other ways."<a name="FNanchor_369:3_2032" id="FNanchor_369:3_2032"></a><a href="#Footnote_369:3_2032" class="fnanchor">[369:3]</a></p>

<p>This divine <i>Tri-murti</i>&mdash;says the Brahmans and the sacred books&mdash;is
indivisible in essence, and indivisible in action; mystery profound!
which is explained in the following manner:</p>

<p><i>Brahma</i> represents the <i>creative</i> principle, the unreflected or
unevolved protogoneus state of divinity&mdash;the <i>Father</i>.</p>

<p><i>Vishnu</i> represents the <i>protecting</i> and <i>preserving</i> principle, the
evolved or reflected state of divinity&mdash;the <i>Son</i>.<a name="FNanchor_369:4_2033" id="FNanchor_369:4_2033"></a><a href="#Footnote_369:4_2033" class="fnanchor">[369:4]</a></p>

<p><i>Siva</i> is the principle that presides at destruction and
re-construction&mdash;the Holy Spirit.<a name="FNanchor_369:5_2034" id="FNanchor_369:5_2034"></a><a href="#Footnote_369:5_2034" class="fnanchor">[369:5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p><p>The third person was the Destroyer, or, in his good capacity, the
Regenerator. The dove was the emblem of the Regenerator. As the
<i>spiritus</i> was the passive cause (brooding on the face of the waters) by
which all things sprang into life, the dove became the emblem of the
Spirit, or Holy Ghost, the third person.</p>

<p>These three gods are the first and the highest manifestations of the
Eternal Essence, and are typified by the three letters composing the
mystic syllable OM or AUM. They constitute the well known Trimurti or
Triad of divine forms which characterizes Hindooism. It is usual to
describe these three gods as Creator, Preserver and Destroyer, but this
gives a very inadequate idea of their complex characters. Nor does the
conception of their relationship to each other become clearer when it is
ascertained that their functions are constantly interchangeable, and
that each may take the place of the other, according to the sentiment
expressed by the greatest of Indian poets, Kalidasa (Kumara-sambhava,
Griffith, vii. 44):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In those three persons the One God was shown&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Each first in place, each last&mdash;not one alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Of Siva, Vishnu, Brahm&#257;, each may be<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">First, second, third, among the blessed three."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A devout person called Attencin, becoming convinced that he should
worship but <i>one</i> deity, thus addressed Brahma, Vishnu and Siva:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"O you <i>three</i> Lords; know that I recognize only <i>One</i> God;
inform me therefore, <i>which of you is the true divinity</i>, that
I may address to him alone my vows and adorations."</p></div>

<p>The three gods became manifest to him, and replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Learn, O devotee, that there is no real distinction between
us; what to you <i>appears</i> such is only by semblance; <i>the
Single Being appears under three forms, but he is
One</i>."<a name="FNanchor_370:1_2035" id="FNanchor_370:1_2035"></a><a href="#Footnote_370:1_2035" class="fnanchor">[370:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Sir William Jones says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Very respectable natives have assured me, that one or two
missionaries have been absurd enough in their zeal for the
conversion of the Gentiles, to urge that the Hindoos were even
now almost Christians; because their Brahm&#257;, Vishnou, and
Mahesa (Siva), were no other than the Christian
Trinity."<a name="FNanchor_370:2_2036" id="FNanchor_370:2_2036"></a><a href="#Footnote_370:2_2036" class="fnanchor">[370:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Thomas Maurice, in his "Indian Antiquities," describes a magnificent
piece of Indian sculpture, of exquisite workmanship, and of stupendous
antiquity, namely:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A bust composed of <i>three heads</i>, united to <i>one body</i>,
adorned with the <i>oldest</i> symbols of the Indian theology, and
thus expressly fabricated according to the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>unanimous
confession of the sacred sacerdotal tribe of India, to
indicate <i>the Creator</i>, the <i>Preserver</i>, and the
<i>Regenerator</i>, of mankind; which <i>establishes the solemn fact,
that from the remotest eras, the Indian nations had adored a
triune deity</i>."<a name="FNanchor_371:1_2037" id="FNanchor_371:1_2037"></a><a href="#Footnote_371:1_2037" class="fnanchor">[371:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Fig. No. 34 is a representation of an Indian sculpture, intended to
represent the Triune God,<a name="FNanchor_371:2_2038" id="FNanchor_371:2_2038"></a><a href="#Footnote_371:2_2038" class="fnanchor">[371:2]</a> evidently similar to the one described
above by Mr. Maurice. It is taken from "a very ancient granite" in the
museum at the "Indian House," and was dug from the ruins of a temple in
the island of Bombay.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 238px;">

</div>

<p>The Buddhists, as well as the Brahmans, have had their Trinity from a
very early period.</p>

<p>Mr. Faber, in his "Origin of Heathen Idolatry," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Among the Hindoos, we have the Triad of Brahm&#257;, Vishnu,
and Siva; so, among the votaries of Buddha, we find the
self-triplicated Buddha declared to be the same as the Hindoo
Trimurti. Among the Buddhist sect of the Jainists, we have the
triple Jiva, in whom the Trimurti is similarly declared to be
incarnate."</p></div>

<p>In this Trinity <i>Vajrapani</i> answers to Brahm&#257;, or Jehovah, the
"All-father," <i>Manjusri</i> is the "deified teacher," the counterpart of
Crishna or Jesus, and <i>Avalokitesvara</i> is the "Holy Spirit."</p>

<p>Buddha was believed by <i>his</i> followers to be, not only an incarnation of
the deity, but "God himself in human form"&mdash;as the followers of Crishna
believed him to be&mdash;and therefore "three gods in one." This is clearly
illustrated by the following address delivered to Buddha by a devotee
called Amora:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Reverence be unto thee, O God, in the form of the God of
mercy, the dispeller of pain and trouble, the Lord of all
things, the guardian of the universe, the emblem of mercy
towards those who serve thee&mdash;OM! the possessor of all things
in vital form. Thou art Brahm&#257;, Vishnu, and Mahesa; thou
art Lord of all the universe. Thou art under the proper form
of all things, movable and immovable, the possessor of the
whole, and thus I adore thee. I adore thee, who art celebrated
by a thousand names, and under various forms; in the shape of
Buddha, the god of mercy."<a name="FNanchor_371:3_2039" id="FNanchor_371:3_2039"></a><a href="#Footnote_371:3_2039" class="fnanchor">[371:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The inhabitants of <i>China</i> and <i>Japan</i>, the majority of whom are
Buddhists, worship God in the form of a Trinity. Their name <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>for him
(Buddha) is Fo, and in speaking of the Trinity they say: "The three
pure, precious or honorable Fo."<a name="FNanchor_372:1_2040" id="FNanchor_372:1_2040"></a><a href="#Footnote_372:1_2040" class="fnanchor">[372:1]</a> This triad is represented in
their temples by images similar to those found in the pagodas of India,
and when they speak of God they say: "<i>Fo is one person, but has three
forms.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_372:2_2041" id="FNanchor_372:2_2041"></a><a href="#Footnote_372:2_2041" class="fnanchor">[372:2]</a></p>

<p>In a chapel belonging to the monastery of Poo-ta-la, which was found in
Manchow-Tartary, was to be seen representations of Fo, in the form of
three persons.<a name="FNanchor_372:3_2042" id="FNanchor_372:3_2042"></a><a href="#Footnote_372:3_2042" class="fnanchor">[372:3]</a></p>

<p>Navarette, in his account of China, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This sect (of Fo) has another idol they call <i>Sanpao</i>. It
consists of <i>three</i>, equal in all respects. This, which has
been represented as an image of the Most Blessed Trinity, is
exactly the same with that which is on the high altar of the
monastery of the Trinitarians at Madrid. If any Chinese
whatsoever saw it, he would say that <i>Sanpao</i> of his country
was worshiped in these parts."</p></div>

<p>And Mr. Faber, in his "Origin of Heathen Idolatry," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Among the Chinese, who worship Buddha under the name of <i>Fo</i>,
we find this God mysteriously multiplied into <i>three
persons</i>."</p></div>

<p>The mystic syllable O. M. or A. U. M. is also reverenced by the Chinese
and Japanese,<a name="FNanchor_372:4_2043" id="FNanchor_372:4_2043"></a><a href="#Footnote_372:4_2043" class="fnanchor">[372:4]</a> as we have found it reverenced by the inhabitants
of India.</p>

<p>The followers of Laou-tsze, or Laou-keum-tsze&mdash;a celebrated philosopher
of China, and deified hero, born 604 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>&mdash;known as the Taou sect, are
also worshipers of a Trinity.<a name="FNanchor_372:5_2044" id="FNanchor_372:5_2044"></a><a href="#Footnote_372:5_2044" class="fnanchor">[372:5]</a> It was the leading feature in
Laou-keun's system of philosophical theology, that Taou, the eternal
reason, produced <i>one</i>; one produced <i>two</i>; two produced <i>three</i>; and
three produced all things.<a name="FNanchor_372:6_2045" id="FNanchor_372:6_2045"></a><a href="#Footnote_372:6_2045" class="fnanchor">[372:6]</a> This was a sentence which Laou-keun
continually repeated, and which Mr. Maurice considers, "a most singular
axiom for a <i>heathen</i> philosopher."<a name="FNanchor_372:7_2046" id="FNanchor_372:7_2046"></a><a href="#Footnote_372:7_2046" class="fnanchor">[372:7]</a></p>

<p>The sacred volumes of the Chinese state that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Source and Root of all is <i>One</i>. This self-existent unity
necessarily produced a <i>second</i>. The first and second, by
their union, produced a <i>third</i>. These <i>Three</i> produced
all."<a name="FNanchor_372:8_2047" id="FNanchor_372:8_2047"></a><a href="#Footnote_372:8_2047" class="fnanchor">[372:8]</a></p></div>

<p>The ancient emperors of China solemnly sacrificed, every three years, to
"Him who is One and Three."<a name="FNanchor_372:9_2048" id="FNanchor_372:9_2048"></a><a href="#Footnote_372:9_2048" class="fnanchor">[372:9]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Egyptians</i> worshiped God in the form of a Trinity, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>which
was represented in sculptures on the most ancient of their temples. The
celebrated symbol of the wing, the globe, and the serpent, is supposed
to have stood for the different attributes of God.<a name="FNanchor_373:1_2049" id="FNanchor_373:1_2049"></a><a href="#Footnote_373:1_2049" class="fnanchor">[373:1]</a></p>

<p>The priests of Memphis, in Egypt, explained this mystery to the novice,
by intimating that the premier (first) <i>monad</i> created the <i>dyad</i>, who
engendered the <i>triad</i>, and that it is this triad which shines through
nature.</p>

<p>Thulis, a great monarch, who at one time reigned over all Egypt, and who
was in the habit of consulting the oracle of Serapis, is said to have
addressed the oracle in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Tell me if ever there was before one greater than I, or will
ever be one greater than me?"</p></div>

<p>The oracle answered thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"First <i>God</i>, afterward the <i>Word</i>, and with them the <i>Holy

<p>The idea of calling the second person in the Trinity the <i>Logos</i>, or

<p>Mr. Bonwick, in his "Egyptian Belief and Modern Thought," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Some persons are prepared to admit that the most astonishing
development of the old religion of Egypt was in relation to
the <i>Logos</i> or Divine <i>Word</i>, by whom all things were made,
and who, though from God, was God. It had long been known that
Plato, Aristotle, and others before the Christian era,
cherished the idea of this Demiurgus; but it was not known
till of late that Chaldeans and Egyptians recognized this
mysterious principle."<a name="FNanchor_373:6_2054" id="FNanchor_373:6_2054"></a><a href="#Footnote_373:6_2054" class="fnanchor">[373:6]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>Logos</i> or <i>Word</i> was a great mystery (among the

<p>The Chaldeans had their <i>Memra</i> or "Word of God," corresponding to the

<p>The Logos was with Philoa most interesting subject of discourse,
tempting him to wonderful feats of imagination. There is scarcely a
personifying or exalting epithet that he did not bestow on the Divine
Reason. He described it as a distinct being; called it "a Rock," "The
Summit of the Universe," "Before all things," "First-begotten Son of
God," "Eternal Bread from Heaven," "Fountain of Wisdom," "Guide to God,"
"Substitute for God," "Image of God," "Priest," "Creator of the Worlds,"
"Second God," "Interpreter of God," "Ambassador of God," "Power of God,"
"King," "Angel," "Man," "Mediator," "Light," "The Beginning," "The

<p>This is exactly the Logos of John. It becomes a man, "is made flesh;"
appears as an <i>incarnation</i>; in order that the God whom "no man has seen
at any time," may be manifested.</p>

<p>The worship of God in the form of a Trinity was to be found among the
ancient <i>Greeks</i>. When the priests were about to offer up a sacrifice to
the gods, the altar was <i>three times</i> sprinkled by dipping a laurel
branch in holy water, and the people assembled around it were <i>three
times</i> sprinkled also. Frankincense was taken from the censer with
<i>three fingers</i>, and strewed upon the altar <i>three times</i>. This was done
because an oracle had declared that <i>all sacred things ought to be in
threes</i>, therefore, that number was scrupulously observed in most
religious ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_374:6_2060" id="FNanchor_374:6_2060"></a><a href="#Footnote_374:6_2060" class="fnanchor">[374:6]</a></p>

<p>This Trinitarian view of the Deity he is said to have brought from
Egypt, and the Christian Fathers of the third and fourth centuries
claimed that Pythagoras, Heraclitus, and Plato&mdash;who taught the doctrine
of the Trinity&mdash;had drawn their theological philosophy from the writings
of Orpheus.<a name="FNanchor_375:2_2063" id="FNanchor_375:2_2063"></a><a href="#Footnote_375:2_2063" class="fnanchor">[375:2]</a></p>

<p>The works of Plato were extensively studied by the Church Fathers, one

honorable testimony borne to the Pagan deity by a barbarian&mdash;for such is
what he calls the writer of John i. 1. His words are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This plainly was the Word, by whom all things were made, he
being himself eternal, as Heraclitus also would say; and by

<p>The Christian Father, Justin Martyr, <i>apologizing</i> for the Christian
religion, tells the Emperor Antoninus Pius, that the Pagans need not
taunt the Christians for worshiping the Logos, which "was with God, and
was God," as <i>they were also guilty of the same act</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If we (Christians) hold," says he, "some opinions near of kin
to the poets and philosophers, in great repute among you, why
are we thus unjustly hated?" "There's <i>Mercury</i>, Jove's
interpreter, in imitation of the Logos, in worship among you,"
and "as to the Son of God, called Jesus, should we allow him
to be nothing more than man, yet the title of the 'Son of God'
is very justifiable, upon the account of his wisdom,
considering <i>you</i> have your <i>Mercury</i>, (also called the 'Son
of God') in worship under the title of the <i>Word</i> and

<p>We see, then, that the title "Word" or "Logos," being applied to Jesus,
is another piece of Pagan amalgamation with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>Christianity. <i>It did not

<p>The ancient Pagan <i>Romans</i> worshiped a Trinity. An oracle is said to

the same as that of the Hindoos: Oromasdes was the Creator, Mithras was
the "Son of God," the "Saviour," the "Mediator" or "Intercessor," and
Ahriman was the Destroyer. In the oracles of Zoroaster the Persian
lawgiver, is to be found the following sentence:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A <i>Triad</i> of Deity shines forth through the whole world, of

<p>Plutarch, "De Iside et Osiride," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Zoroaster is said to have made a <i>threefold</i> distribution of

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>Vandals</i><a name="FNanchor_376:10_2078" id="FNanchor_376:10_2078"></a><a href="#Footnote_376:10_2078" class="fnanchor">[376:10]</a> had a god called Triglaff. One of these
was found at <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>Hertungerberg, near Brandenburg (in Prussia). He
was represented with <i>three heads</i>. This was apparently the

<p>The ancient <i>Scandinavians</i> worshiped a triple deity who was yet one
god. It consisted of Odin, Thor, and Frey. A triune statue representing
this Trinity in Unity was found at Upsal in Sweden.<a name="FNanchor_377:2_2080" id="FNanchor_377:2_2080"></a><a href="#Footnote_377:2_2080" class="fnanchor">[377:2]</a> The three
principal nations of Scandinavia (Sweden, Denmark, and Norway) vied with
each other in erecting temples, but none were more famous than the
temple at Upsal in Sweden. It glittered on all sides with gold. It
seemed to be particularly consecrated to the <i>Three Superior Deities</i>,
Odin, Thor and Frey. The statues of these gods were placed in this
temple on three thrones, one above the other. <i>Odin</i> was represented
holding a sword in his hand: <i>Thor</i> stood at the left hand of Odin, with
a crown upon his head, and a scepter in his hand; <i>Frey</i> stood at the
left hand of Thor, and was represented of both sexes. Odin was the
supreme God, the <i>Al-fader</i>; Thor was the first-begotten son of this
god, and Frey was the bestower of fertility, peace and riches. King
Gylfi of Sweden is supposed to have gone at one time to <i>Asgard</i> (the
abode of the gods), where he beheld three thrones raised one above
another, with a man sitting on each of them. Upon his asking what the
names of these lords might be, his guide answered: "He who sitteth on
the lowest throne is <i>the Lofty One</i>; the second is <i>the equal to the
Lofty One</i>; and he who sitteth on the highest throne is called <i>the
Third</i>."<a name="FNanchor_377:3_2081" id="FNanchor_377:3_2081"></a><a href="#Footnote_377:3_2081" class="fnanchor">[377:3]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Druids</i> also worshiped: "<i>Ain Treidhe Dia ainm Taulac, Fan,

Mollac."<a name="FNanchor_377:4_2082" id="FNanchor_377:4_2082"></a><a href="#Footnote_377:4_2082" class="fnanchor">[377:4]</a></p>

<p>The ancient inhabitants of <i>Siberia</i> worshiped a triune God. In remote
ages, wanderers from India directed their eyes northward, and crossing
the vast Tartarian deserts, finally settled in Siberia, bringing with
them the worship of a triune God. This is clearly shown from the fact
stated by Thomas Maurice, that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The first Christian missionaries who arrived in those
regions, found the people already in possession of that
fundamental doctrine of the true religion, which, among
others, they came to impress upon their minds, and universally
adored an idol fabricated to resemble, as near as possible, <i>a
Trinity in Unity</i>."</p></div>

<p>This triune God consisted of, first "the Creator of all things," second,
"the God of Armies," third, "the Spirit of Heavenly Love," and yet these
three were but <i>one</i> indivisible God.<a name="FNanchor_377:5_2083" id="FNanchor_377:5_2083"></a><a href="#Footnote_377:5_2083" class="fnanchor">[377:5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p><p>The <i>Tartars</i> also worshiped God as a Trinity in Unity. On one of their
medals, which is now in the St. Petersburgh Museum, may be seen a
representation of the triple God seated on the lotus.<a name="FNanchor_378:1_2084" id="FNanchor_378:1_2084"></a><a href="#Footnote_378:1_2084" class="fnanchor">[378:1]</a></p>

<p>Even in the remote islands of the Pacific Ocean, the supreme deities are
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit, the latter of which is
symbolized as a bird.<a name="FNanchor_378:2_2085" id="FNanchor_378:2_2085"></a><a href="#Footnote_378:2_2085" class="fnanchor">[378:2]</a></p>

<p>The ancient <i>Mexicans</i> and <i>Peruvians</i> had their Trinity. The supreme
God of the Mexicans (<i>Tezcatlipoca</i>), who had, as Lord Kingsborough
says, "all the attributes and powers which were assigned to Jehovah by
the Hebrews," had associated with him two other gods, <i>Huitzlipochtli</i>
and <i>Tlaloc</i>; one occupied a place upon his left hand, the other on his
right. This was the Trinity of the Mexicans.<a name="FNanchor_378:3_2086" id="FNanchor_378:3_2086"></a><a href="#Footnote_378:3_2086" class="fnanchor">[378:3]</a></p>

<p>When the bishop Don Bartholomew de las Casas proceeded to his bishopric,
which was in 1545, he commissioned an ecclesiastic, whose name was
Francis Hernandez, who was well acquainted with the language of the
Indians (as the natives were called), to visit them, carrying with him a
sort of catechism of what he was about to preach. In about one year from
the time that Francis Hernandez was sent out, he wrote to Bishop las
Casas, stating that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Indians believed in the God who was in heaven; that this
God was the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and that the Father
was named <i>Yzona</i>, the Son <i>Bacab</i>, who was born of a Virgin,

<p>The Rev. Father Acosta says, in speaking of the <i>Peruvians</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is strange that the devil after his manner hath brought a
Trinity into idolatry, for the three images of the Sun called
<i>Apomti</i>, <i>Churunti</i>, and <i>Intiquaoqui</i>, signifieth Father and

<p>"Being in Chuquisaca, an honorable priest showed me an
information, which I had long in my hands, where it was proved
that there was a certain oratory, whereat the Indians did
worship an idol called <i>Tangatanga</i>, which they said was 'One
in Three, and Three in One.' And as this priest stood amazed
thereat, I said that the devil by his internal and obstinate
pride (whereby he always pretends to make himself God) did
steal all that he could from the truth, to employ it in his
lying and deceits."<a name="FNanchor_378:5_2088" id="FNanchor_378:5_2088"></a><a href="#Footnote_378:5_2088" class="fnanchor">[378:5]</a></p></div>

<p>The doctrine was recognized among the Indians of the Californian
peninsula. The statue of the principal deity of the New Granadian
Indians had "three heads on one body," and was understood to be "three
persons with one heart and one will."<a name="FNanchor_378:6_2089" id="FNanchor_378:6_2089"></a><a href="#Footnote_378:6_2089" class="fnanchor">[378:6]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p><p>The result of our investigations then, is that, for ages before the
time of Christ Jesus or Christianity, God was worshiped in the form of a
<span class="smcap">Triad</span>, and that this doctrine was extensively diffused through all
nations. That it was established in regions as far distant as China and
Mexico, and immemorially acknowledged through the whole extent of Egypt
and India. That it flourished with equal vigor among the snowy mountains
of Thibet, and the vast deserts of Siberia. That the barbarians of
central Europe, the Scandinavians, and the Druids of Britain and
Ireland, bent their knee to an idol of a <i>Triune God</i>. What then becomes
of "the Ever-Blessed Trinity" of Christianity? It must fall, together
with all the rest of its dogmas, and be buried with the Pagan d&eacute;bris.</p>

<p>The learned Thomas Maurice imagined that this mysterious doctrine must
have been revealed by God to Adam, or to Noah, or to Abraham, or to
somebody else. Notice with what caution he wrote (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 1794) on this
subject. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the course of the wide range which I have been compelled
to take in the field of Asiatic mythology, certain topics have
arisen for discussion, <i>equally delicate and perplexing</i>.
Among them, in particular, a species of Trinity forms a

Oriental theology."</p></div>

<p>After saying, "<i>I venture with a trembling step</i>," and that, "It was not
from <i>choice</i>, but from <i>necessity</i>, that I entered thus upon this
subject," he concludes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This extensive and interesting subject engrosses a
considerable portion of this work, <i>and my anxiety to prepare
the public mind to receive it</i>, my efforts to elucidate so
<i>mysterious</i> a point of theology, induces me to remind the

discovered, not only in the <i>three</i> principals of the Chaldaic
theology; in the <i>Triplasios</i> Mithra of Persia; in the
<i>Triad</i>, Brahm&#257;, Vishnu, and Siva, of India&mdash;where it was
evidently promulgated in the Geeta, <i>fifteen hundred years
before the birth of Plato</i>;<a name="FNanchor_379:1_2090" id="FNanchor_379:1_2090"></a><a href="#Footnote_379:1_2090" class="fnanchor">[379:1]</a> but in the Numen Triplex of

day in the valuable cabinet of the Empress, at St.
Petersburgh; in the Tanga-Tanga, or Three in One, of the South
Americans; and, finally, without mentioning the vestiges of it

<p>It was a long time after the followers of Christ Jesus had made him <i>a</i>
God, before they ventured to declare that he was "<i>God <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>himself in human
form</i>," and, "<i>the second person in the Ever-Blessed Trinity</i>." It was

who, about the middle of the second century, first promulgated the
opinion, that Jesus of Nazareth, the "Son of God," was the second
principle in the Deity, and the Creator of all material things. He is
the earliest writer to whom the opinion can be traced. This knowledge,
he does not ascribe to the Scriptures, but to the special favor of
God.<a name="FNanchor_380:2_2093" id="FNanchor_380:2_2093"></a><a href="#Footnote_380:2_2093" class="fnanchor">[380:2]</a></p>

<p>The passage in I. John, v. 7, which reads thus: "For there are three

<p>The subtle and profound questions concerning the nature, generation, the

part of the established Christian faith until as late as <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 327, when
the question was settled at the Councils of Nice and Constantinople. <i>Up
to this time there was no understood and recognized doctrine on this
high subject.</i> The Christians were for the most part accustomed to use
scriptural expressions in speaking of the Father, and the Son, and the
Spirit, without defining articulately their relation to one
another.<a name="FNanchor_380:5_2096" id="FNanchor_380:5_2096"></a><a href="#Footnote_380:5_2096" class="fnanchor">[380:5]</a></p>

<p>In these trinitarian controversies, which first broke out in
Egypt&mdash;<i>Egypt, the land of Trinities</i>&mdash;the chief point in the discussion
was to define the position of "the Son."</p>

<p>There lived in <i>Alexandria</i> a presbyter of the name of <i>Arius</i>, a
disappointed candidate for the office of bishop. He took the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>ground
that there was a time when, from the very nature of <i>Sonship</i>, the Son
did not exist, and a time at which he commenced to be, asserting that it
is the necessary condition of the filial relation <i>that a father must be
older than his son</i>. But this assertion evidently denied the
<i>co-eternity</i> of the three persons of the Trinity, it suggested a
<i>subordination</i> or <i>inequality</i> among them, and indeed implied a time
when the Trinity did not exist. Hereupon, the bishop, who had been the
successful competitor against Arius, displayed his rhetorical powers in
public debates on the question, and, the strife spreading, the Jews and
Pagans, who formed a very large portion of the population of Alexandria,
<i>amused themselves with theatrical representations of the contest on the
stage&mdash;the point of their burlesques being the equality of age of the
Father and the Son</i>. Such was the violence the controversy at length
assumed, that the matter had to be referred to the emperor
(Constantine).</p>

<p>At first he looked upon the dispute as altogether frivolous, and perhaps
in truth inclined to the assertion of Arius, that in the very nature of
the thing a father must be older than his son. So great, however, was
the pressure laid upon him, that he was eventually compelled to summon
the Council of Nicea, which, to dispose of the conflict, set forth a
formulary or creed, and attached to it this anathema:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes those
who say that there was a time when the Son of God was not, and
that, before he was begotten, he was not, and that, he was
made out of nothing, or out of another substance or essence,
and is created, or changeable, or alterable."</p></div>

<p>Constantine at once <i>enforced</i> the decision of the council by the civil
power.<a name="FNanchor_381:1_2097" id="FNanchor_381:1_2097"></a><a href="#Footnote_381:1_2097" class="fnanchor">[381:1]</a></p>

<p>Even after this "subtle and profound question" had been settled at the
Council of Nice, those who settled it did not understand the question
they had settled. Athanasius, who was a member of the first general
council, and who is said to have written the <i>creed</i> which bears his
name, which asserts that the true Catholic faith is this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That we worship <i>One</i> God as Trinity, and Trinity in
Unity&mdash;neither confounding the persons nor dividing the
substance&mdash;for there is one person of the Father, another of
the Son, and another of the Holy Ghost, but the Godhead of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost <i>is all one</i>,
the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal,"</p></div>

<p>&mdash;also confessed that whenever he forced his understanding to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>meditate
on the divinity of the Logos, his toilsome and unavailing efforts
recoiled on themselves; <i>that the more he thought the less he
comprehended; and the more he wrote the less capable was he of
expressing his thoughts</i>.<a name="FNanchor_382:1_2098" id="FNanchor_382:1_2098"></a><a href="#Footnote_382:1_2098" class="fnanchor">[382:1]</a></p>

<p>We see, then, that this great question was settled, not by the consent
of all members of the council, but simply because the <i>majority</i> were in
favor of it. Jesus of Nazareth was "God himself in human form;" "one of
the persons of the Ever-Blessed Trinity," who "had no beginning, and
will have no end," <i>because the majority of the members of this council
said so</i>. Hereafter&mdash;so it was decreed&mdash;<i>all must believe it</i>; if not,
they must not oppose it, but forever hold their peace.</p>

<p>The Emperor Theodosius declared his resolution of expelling from all the
churches of his dominions, the bishops and their clergy who should
obstinately refuse to believe, <i>or at least to profess</i>, the doctrine of
the Council of Nice. His lieutenant, Sapor, was armed with the ample
powers of a general law, a special commission, <i>and a military force</i>;
and this ecclesiastical resolution was conducted <i>with so much
discretion and vigor, that the religion of the Emperor was
established</i>.<a name="FNanchor_382:2_2099" id="FNanchor_382:2_2099"></a><a href="#Footnote_382:2_2099" class="fnanchor">[382:2]</a></p>

<p>Here we have the historical fact, that bishops of the Christian church,
and their clergy, <i>were forced to profess their belief in the doctrine
of the Trinity</i>.</p>

<p>We also find that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This orthodox Emperor (Theodosius) considered every heretic
(as he called those who did not believe as he and his
ecclesiastics professed) as a rebel against the supreme powers
of heaven and of earth (he being one of the supreme powers of
earth) <i>and each of the powers</i> might exercise their peculiar
jurisdiction <i>over the soul and body of the guilty</i>.</p>

<p>"The decrees of the Council of Constantinople had ascertained
the <i>true</i> standard of the faith, <i>and the ecclesiastics, who
governed the conscience of Theodosius, suggested the most
effectual methods of persecution</i>. In the space of fifteen
years he promulgated at least fifteen severe edicts against
the heretics, <i>more especially against those who rejected the
doctrine of the Trinity</i>."<a name="FNanchor_382:3_2100" id="FNanchor_382:3_2100"></a><a href="#Footnote_382:3_2100" class="fnanchor">[382:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Thus we see one of the many reasons why the "most holy Christian
religion" spread so rapidly.</p>

<p>Arius&mdash;who declared that in the nature of things a father must be older
than his son&mdash;was excommunicated for his so-called heretical notions
concerning the Trinity. His followers, who were very <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>numerous, were
called Arians. Their writings, if they had been permitted to
exist,<a name="FNanchor_383:1_2101" id="FNanchor_383:1_2101"></a><a href="#Footnote_383:1_2101" class="fnanchor">[383:1]</a> would undoubtedly contain the lamentable story of the
persecution which affected the church under the reign of the impious
Emperor Theodosius.</p>

<p>The following answer is stated by Manetho, an Egyptian priest, to have
been given by an Oracle to Sesostris: "On his return through Africa he
entered the sanctuary of the Oracle, saying: 'Tell me, O thou strong in
fire, who before me could subjugate all things? and who shall after me?'
But the Oracle rebuked him, saying, 'First, <i>God</i>; then the <i>Word</i>; and
with them, the <i>Spirit</i>.'" (Nimrod, vol. i. p. 119, in Ibid. vol. i. p.
805.)</p>

<p>"The <i>Platonists</i> furnished brilliant recruits to the Christian churches

<h3>PAGANISM IN CHRISTIANITY.</h3>

<p>Our assertion that that which is called Christianity is nothing more
than the religion of Paganism, we consider to have been fully verified.
We have found among the heathen, centuries before the time of Christ
Jesus, the belief in an incarnate God born of a virgin; his previous
existence in heaven; the celestial signs at the time of his birth; the
rejoicing in heaven; the adoration by the magi and shepherds; the
offerings of precious substances to the divine child; the slaughter of
the innocents; the presentation at the temple; the temptation by the
devil; the performing of miracles; the crucifixion by enemies; and the
death, resurrection, and ascension into heaven. We have also found the
belief that this incarnate God was from all eternity; that he was the
Creator of the world, and that he is to be Judge of the dead at the last
day. We have also seen the practice of Baptism, and the sacrament of the
Lord's Supper or Eucharist, added to the belief in a Triune God,
consisting of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Let us now compare the
Christian creed with ancient Pagan belief.</p>

<p>The above is the so-called "<i>Apostles' Creed</i>," as it now stands in the
book of common prayer of the United Church of England and Ireland, as by
law established.</p>

<p>It is affirmed by Ambrose, that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The twelve apostles, as skilled artificers, assembled
together, and made a key by their common advice, that is, the
Creed, by which the darkness of the devil is disclosed, that
the light of Christ may appear."</p></div>

<p>Others fable that every Apostle inserted an article, by which the Creed
is divided into twelve articles.</p>

<p>The earliest account of its origin we have from Ruffinus, an historical
compiler and traditionist of the <i>fourth</i> century, but not in the form
in which it is known at present, it having been added to since that
time. The most important addition is that which affirms that Jesus
descended into hell, which has been added since <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 600.<a name="FNanchor_385:9_2114" id="FNanchor_385:9_2114"></a><a href="#Footnote_385:9_2114" class="fnanchor">[385:9]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p><p>Beside what we have already seen, the ancient Pagans had many beliefs
and ceremonies which are to be found among the Christians. One of these
is the story of "<i>The War in Heaven</i>."</p>

<p>The New Testament version is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There was a war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought
against the dragon, and the dragon fought, and his angels, and
prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in
heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent,
called the devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world,
he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out
with him."<a name="FNanchor_386:1_2115" id="FNanchor_386:1_2115"></a><a href="#Footnote_386:1_2115" class="fnanchor">[386:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The cause of the revolt, it is said, was that Satan, who was then an
angel, desired to be as great as God. The writer of Isaiah, xiv. 13, 14,
is supposed to refer to it when he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I
will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also
upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the North;
I will ascend before the heights of the clouds; I will be like
the Most High."</p></div>

<p>The Catholic theory of the fall of the angels is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the beginning, before the creation of heaven and earth,
God made the angels, free intelligences, and free wills, out
of his love He made them, that they might be eternally happy.
And that their happiness might be complete, he gave them the
perfection of a created nature, that is, he gave them freedom.
But happiness is only attained by the free will agreeing in
its freedom to accord with the will of God. Some of the angels
by an act of free will obeyed the will of God, and in such
obedience found perfect happiness. Other angels, by an act of
free will, rebelled against the will of God, and in such
disobedience found misery."<a name="FNanchor_386:2_2116" id="FNanchor_386:2_2116"></a><a href="#Footnote_386:2_2116" class="fnanchor">[386:2]</a></p></div>

<p>They were driven out of heaven, after having a combat with the obedient
angels, and cast into hell. The writer of second <i>Peter</i> alludes to it
in saying that God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down
into hell.<a name="FNanchor_386:3_2117" id="FNanchor_386:3_2117"></a><a href="#Footnote_386:3_2117" class="fnanchor">[386:3]</a></p>

<p>The writer of <i>Jude</i> also alludes to it in saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The angels which kept not their first estate, but left their
own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under
darkness unto the judgment of the great day."<a name="FNanchor_386:4_2118" id="FNanchor_386:4_2118"></a><a href="#Footnote_386:4_2118" class="fnanchor">[386:4]</a></p></div>

<p>According to the <i>Talmudists</i>, Satan, whose proper name is Sammael, was
one of the Seraphim of heaven, with six wings.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He was not driven out of heaven until after he had led Adam
and Eve into sin; then Sammael and his host were precipitated
out of the place of bliss, with God's curse to weigh them
down. In the struggle between Michael and Sammael, the falling
Seraph caught the wings of Michael, and tried to drag him down
with him, but God saved him, when Michael derived his
name,&mdash;the Rescued."<a name="FNanchor_386:5_2119" id="FNanchor_386:5_2119"></a><a href="#Footnote_386:5_2119" class="fnanchor">[386:5]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p><p>Sammael was formerly chief among the angels of God, and now he is
prince among devils. His name is derived from Simm&#275;, which means, to
blind and deceive. He stands on the left side of men. He goes by various
names; such as "The Old Serpent," "The Unclean Spirit," "Satan,"
"Leviathan," and sometimes also "Asael."<a name="FNanchor_387:1_2120" id="FNanchor_387:1_2120"></a><a href="#Footnote_387:1_2120" class="fnanchor">[387:1]</a></p>

<p>According to <i>Hindoo</i> mythology, there is a legion of evil spirits
called <i>Rakshasas</i>, who are governed by a prince named <i>Ravana</i>. These
Rakshasas are continually aiming to do injury to mankind, and are the
same who fought desperate battles with <i>Indra</i>, and his Spirits of
Light. They would have taken his paradise by storm, and subverted the
whole order of the universe, if Brahm&#257; had not sent <i>Vishnou</i> to
circumvent their plans.</p>

<p>In the <i>Aitareya-brahmana</i> (Hindoo) written, according to Prof. Monier
Williams, seven or eight centuries <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, we have the following legend:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The gods and demons were engaged in warfare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The evil demons, like to mighty kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Made these worlds castles; then they formed the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Into an iron citadel, the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Into a silver fortress, and the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Into a fort of gold. Whereat the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Said to each other, 'Frame me other worlds<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">In opposition to these fortresses.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Then they constructed sacrificial places,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Where they performed a triple burnt oblation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">By the first sacrifice they drove the demons<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Out of their earthly fortress, by the second<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Out of the air, and by the third oblation<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Out of the sky. Thus were the evil spirits<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Chased by the gods in triumph from the worlds."<a name="FNanchor_387:2_2121" id="FNanchor_387:2_2121"></a><a href="#Footnote_387:2_2121" class="fnanchor">[387:2]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The ancient <i>Egyptians</i> were familiar with the tale of the war in
heaven; and the legend of the revolt against the god R&#257;, the Heavenly
Father, and his destruction of the revolters, was discovered by M.
Naville in one of the tombs at Biban-el-moluk.<a name="FNanchor_387:3_2122" id="FNanchor_387:3_2122"></a><a href="#Footnote_387:3_2122" class="fnanchor">[387:3]</a></p>

<p>The same story is to be found among the ancient <i>Persian</i> legends, and
is related as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ahriman, the devil, was not created evil by the eternal one,
but he became evil by revolting against his will. This revolt
resulted in a 'war in heaven.' In this war the <i>Iveds</i> (good
angels) fought against the <i>Divs</i> (rebellious ones) headed by
<i>Ahriman</i>, and flung the conquered into Douzahk or
hell."<a name="FNanchor_387:4_2123" id="FNanchor_387:4_2123"></a><a href="#Footnote_387:4_2123" class="fnanchor">[387:4]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p><p>An extract from the Persian <i>Zend-avesta</i> reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Ahriman</i> interrupted the order of the universe, raised an
army against <i>Ormuzd</i>, and having maintained a fight against
him during ninety days, was at length vanquished by Honover,
the divine Word."<a name="FNanchor_388:1_2124" id="FNanchor_388:1_2124"></a><a href="#Footnote_388:1_2124" class="fnanchor">[388:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The <i>Assyrians</i> had an account of a war in heaven, which was like that
described in the book of Enoch and the Revelation.<a name="FNanchor_388:2_2125" id="FNanchor_388:2_2125"></a><a href="#Footnote_388:2_2125" class="fnanchor">[388:2]</a></p>

<p>This legend was also to be found among the ancient Greeks, in the
struggle of the <i>Titans</i> against <i>Jupiter</i>. Titan and all his rebellious
host were cast out of heaven, and imprisoned in the dark abyss.<a name="FNanchor_388:3_2126" id="FNanchor_388:3_2126"></a><a href="#Footnote_388:3_2126" class="fnanchor">[388:3]</a></p>

<p>Among the legends of the ancient <i>Mexicans</i> was found this same story of
the war in heaven, and the downfall of the rebellious angels.<a name="FNanchor_388:4_2127" id="FNanchor_388:4_2127"></a><a href="#Footnote_388:4_2127" class="fnanchor">[388:4]</a></p>

<p>"The natives of the <i>Caroline Islands</i> (in the North Pacific Ocean),
related that one of the inferior gods, named <i>Merogrog</i>, was driven by
the other gods out of heaven."<a name="FNanchor_388:5_2128" id="FNanchor_388:5_2128"></a><a href="#Footnote_388:5_2128" class="fnanchor">[388:5]</a></p>

<p>We see, therefore, that this also was an almost universal legend.</p>

<p>The belief in <i>a future life</i> was almost universal among nations of
antiquity. The <i>Hindoos</i> have believed from time immemorial that man has
an invisible body within the material body; that is, a soul.</p>

<p>Among the ancient <i>Egyptians</i> the same belief was to be found. All the
dead, both men and women, were spoken of as "<i>Osiriana</i>;" by which they
intended to signify "gone to Osiris."</p>

<p>Their belief in One Supreme Being, and the immortality of the soul, must
have been very ancient; for on a monument, which dates ages before
Abraham is said to have lived, is found this epitaph: "May thy soul
attain to the Creator of all mankind." Sculptures and paintings in these
grand receptacles of the dead, as translated by Champollion, represent
the deceased ushered into the world of spirits by funeral deities, who
announce, "A soul arrived in Amenti."<a name="FNanchor_388:6_2129" id="FNanchor_388:6_2129"></a><a href="#Footnote_388:6_2129" class="fnanchor">[388:6]</a></p>

<p>The Hindoo idea of a subtile invisible body within the material body,
reappeared in the description of Greek poets. They represented the
constitution of man as consisting of three principles: the soul, the
invisible body, and the material body. The invisible body they called
the ghost or shade, and considered it as the material portion of the
soul. At death, the soul, clothed in this <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>subtile body, went to enjoy
paradise for a season, or suffer in hell till its sins were expiated.
This paradise was called the "Elysian Fields," and the hell was called
Tartarus.</p>

<p>The paradise, some supposed to be a part of the lower world, some placed
them in a middle zone in the air, some in the moon, and others in
far-off isles in the ocean. There shone more glorious sun and stars than
illuminated this world. The day was always serene, the air forever pure,
and a soft, celestial light clothed all things in transfigured beauty.
Majestic groves, verdant meadows, and blooming gardens varied the
landscape. The river Eridanus flowed through winding banks fringed with
laurel. On its borders lived heroes who had died for their country,
priests who had led a pure life, artists who had embodied genuine beauty
in their work, and poets who had never degraded their muse with subjects
unworthy of Apollo. There each one renewed the pleasures in which he
formerly delighted. Orpheus, in long white robes, made enrapturing music
on his lyre, while others danced and sang. The husband rejoined his
beloved wife; old friendships were renewed, the poet repeated his
verses, and the charioteer managed his horses.</p>

<p>Some souls wandered in vast forests between Tartarus and Elysium, not
good enough for one, or bad enough for the other. Some were purified
from their sins by exposure to searching winds, others by being
submerged in deep waters, others by passing through intense fires. After
a long period of probation and suffering, many of them gained the
Elysian Fields. This belief is handed down to our day in the Roman
Catholic idea of <i>Purgatory</i>.</p>

<p>A belief in the existence of the soul after death was indicated in all
periods of history of the world, by the fact that man was always
accustomed to address prayers to the spirits of their ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_389:1_2130" id="FNanchor_389:1_2130"></a><a href="#Footnote_389:1_2130" class="fnanchor">[389:1]</a></p>

<p>These <i>heavens</i> and <i>hells</i> where men abode after death, vary, in
different countries, according to the likes and dislikes of each nation.</p>

<p>All the Teutonic nations held to a fixed Elysium and a hell, where the
valiant and the just were rewarded, and where the cowardly and the
wicked suffered punishment. As all nations have made a god, and that god
has resembled the persons who made it, so have all nations made a
heaven, and that heaven corresponds to the fancies of the people who
have created it.</p>

<p>In the prose Edda there is a description of the joys of <i>Valhalla</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>(the
Hall of the Chosen), which states that: "All men who have fallen in
fight since the beginning of the world are gone to Odin (the Supreme
God), in Valhalla." A mighty band of men are there, "and every day, as
soon as they have dressed themselves, they ride out into the court (or
field), and there fight until they cut each other into pieces. This is
their pastime, but when the meal-tide approaches, they remount their
steeds, and return to drink in <i>Valhalla</i>. As it is said (in
Vafthrudnis-mal):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>This description of the palace of Odin is a natural picture of the
manners of the ancient Scandinavians and Germans. Prompted by the wants
of their climate, and the impulse of their own temperament, they formed
to themselves a delicious paradise in their own way; where they were to
eat and drink, and fight. The women, to whom they assigned a place
there, were introduced for no other purpose but to fill their cups.</p>

<p>The Mohammedan paradise differs from this. Women <i>there</i>, are for man's
pleasure. The day is always serene, the air forever pure, and a soft
celestial light clothes all things in transfigured beauty. Majestic
groves, verdant meadows, and blooming gardens vary the landscape. There,
in radiant halls, dwell the departed, ever blooming and beautiful, ever
laughing and gay.</p>

<p>The American Indian calculates upon finding successful chases after wild
animals, verdant plains, and no winter, as the characteristics of his
"future life."</p>

<p>The red Indian, when told by a missionary that in the "promised land"
they would neither eat, drink, hunt, nor marry a wife, contemptuously
replied, that instead of wishing to go there, he should deem his
residence in such a place as the greatest possible calamity. Many not
only rejected such a destiny for themselves, but were indignant at the
attempt to decoy their children into such a comfortless region.</p>

<p>All nations of the earth have had their heavens. As Moore observes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A heaven, too, ye must have, ye lords of dust&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">A splendid paradise, poor souls, ye must:<br /></span>

<span class="i0i">The heaven of each is but what each desires."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Heaven</i> was born of the sky,<a name="FNanchor_391:1_2132" id="FNanchor_391:1_2132"></a><a href="#Footnote_391:1_2132" class="fnanchor">[391:1]</a> and nurtured by cunning priests,
who made man a coward and a slave.</p>

<p><i>Hell</i> was built by priests, and nurtured by the fears and servile
fancies of man during the ages when dungeons of torture were a
recognized part of every government, and when God was supposed to be an
infinite tyrant, with infinite resources of vengeance.</p>

<p><i>The devil</i> is an imaginary being, invented by primitive man to account
for the existence of evil, and relieve God of his responsibility. The
famous Hindoo <i>Rakshasas</i> of our Aryan ancestors&mdash;the dark and evil
<i>clouds</i> personified&mdash;are the originals of all devils. The cloudy shape
has assumed a thousand different forms, horrible or grotesque and
ludicrous, to suit the changing fancies of the ages.</p>

<p>But strange as it may appear, the god of one nation became the devil of
another.</p>

<p>The rock of Behistun, the sculptured chronicle of the glories of Darius,
king of Persia, situated on the western frontier of Media, on the
high-road from Babylon to the eastward, was used as a "holy of holies."
It was named <i>Bagistane</i>&mdash;"the place of the <i>Baga</i>"&mdash;referring to
Ormuzd, chief of the Bagas. When examined with the lenses of linguistic
science, the "<i>Bogie</i>" or "<i>Bug-a-boo</i>" or "<i>Bugbear</i>" of nursery lore,
turns out to be identical with the Slavonic "<i>Bog</i>" and the "<i>Baga</i>" of
the cuneiform inscriptions, both of which are names of the <i>Supreme
Being</i>. It is found also in the old Aryan "<i>Bhaga</i>," who is described in
a commentary of the <i>Rig-Veda</i> as the lord of life, the giver of bread,
and the bringer of happiness. Thus, the same name which, to the <i>Vedic</i>
poet, to the Persian of the time of Xerxes, and to the modern Russian,
suggests the supreme majesty of deity, is in English associated with an
ugly and ludicrous fiend. Another striking illustration is to be found
in the word <i>devil</i> itself. When traced back to its primitive source, it
is found to be a name of the Supreme Being.<a name="FNanchor_391:2_2133" id="FNanchor_391:2_2133"></a><a href="#Footnote_391:2_2133" class="fnanchor">[391:2]</a></p>

<p>The ancients had a great number of festival days, many of which are
handed down to the present time, and are to be found in Christianity.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the 25th of December was almost a universal
festival among the ancients; so it is the same with the <i>spring</i>
festivals, when days of fasting are observed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p><p>The <i>Hindoos</i> hold a festival, called <i>Siva-ratri</i>, in honor of <i>Siva</i>,
about the middle or end of February. <i>A strict fast is observed during
the day.</i> They have also a festival in April, when a strict fast is kept
by some.<a name="FNanchor_392:1_2134" id="FNanchor_392:1_2134"></a><a href="#Footnote_392:1_2134" class="fnanchor">[392:1]</a></p>

<p>At the <i>spring equinox</i> most nations of antiquity set apart a day to
implore the blessings of their god, or gods, on the fruits of the earth.
At the autumnal equinox, they offered the fruits of the harvest, and
returned thanks. In China, these religious solemnities are called
"Festivals of gratitude to Tien."<a name="FNanchor_392:2_2135" id="FNanchor_392:2_2135"></a><a href="#Footnote_392:2_2135" class="fnanchor">[392:2]</a> The last named corresponds to
<i>our</i> "Thanksgiving" celebration.</p>

<p>One of the most considerable festivals held by the ancient
<i>Scandinavians</i> was the <i>spring</i> celebration. This was held in honor of
Odin, at the beginning of spring, in order to welcome in that pleasant
season, and to obtain of their god happy success in their projected
expeditions.</p>

<p>Another festival was held toward the autumn equinox, when they were
accustomed to kill all their cattle in good condition, and lay in a
store of provision for the winter. This festival was also attended with
religious ceremonies, when Odin, the supreme god, was thanked for what
he had given them, by having his altar loaded with the fruits of their
crops, and the choicest products of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_392:3_2136" id="FNanchor_392:3_2136"></a><a href="#Footnote_392:3_2136" class="fnanchor">[392:3]</a></p>

<p>There was a grand celebration in Egypt, called the "Feast of Lamps,"
held at Sais, in honor of the goddess Neith. Those who did not attend
the ceremony, as well as those who did, burned lamps before their houses
all night, filled with oil and salt: thus all Egypt was illuminated. It
was deemed a great irreverence to the goddess for any one to omit this
ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_392:4_2137" id="FNanchor_392:4_2137"></a><a href="#Footnote_392:4_2137" class="fnanchor">[392:4]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Hindoos</i> also held a festival in honor of the goddesses Lakshmi and
Bhavanti, called "<i>The feast of Lamps</i>."<a name="FNanchor_392:5_2138" id="FNanchor_392:5_2138"></a><a href="#Footnote_392:5_2138" class="fnanchor">[392:5]</a> This festival has been
handed down to the present time in what is called "Candlemas day," or
the purification of the Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>The most celebrated Pagan festival held by modern Christians is that
known as "<i>Sunday</i>," or the "Lord's day."</p>

<p>All the principal nations of antiquity kept the <i>seventh</i> day of the
week as a "holy day," just as the ancient Israelites did. This was owing
to the fact that they consecrated the days of the week to the Sun, the
Moon, and the five planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
<i>The seventh day was sacred to Saturn from time <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>immemorial.</i> Homer and
Hesiod call it the "Holy Day."<a name="FNanchor_393:1_2139" id="FNanchor_393:1_2139"></a><a href="#Footnote_393:1_2139" class="fnanchor">[393:1]</a> The people generally visited the
temples of the gods, on that day, and offered up their prayers and
supplications.<a name="FNanchor_393:2_2140" id="FNanchor_393:2_2140"></a><a href="#Footnote_393:2_2140" class="fnanchor">[393:2]</a> The Acadians, thousands of years ago, kept holy
the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th of each month as <i>Salum</i> (rest), on which
certain works were forbidden.<a name="FNanchor_393:3_2141" id="FNanchor_393:3_2141"></a><a href="#Footnote_393:3_2141" class="fnanchor">[393:3]</a> The <i>Arabs</i> anciently worshiped
Saturn under the name of Hobal. In his hands he held <i>seven</i> arrows,
symbols of the planets that preside over the seven days of the
week.<a name="FNanchor_393:4_2142" id="FNanchor_393:4_2142"></a><a href="#Footnote_393:4_2142" class="fnanchor">[393:4]</a> The <i>Egyptians</i> assigned a day of the week to the sun,
moon, and five planets, and the number <i>seven</i> was held there in great
reverence.<a name="FNanchor_393:5_2143" id="FNanchor_393:5_2143"></a><a href="#Footnote_393:5_2143" class="fnanchor">[393:5]</a></p>

<p>The planet <i>Saturn</i> very early became the chief deity of Semitic
religion. Moses consecrated the number seven to him.<a name="FNanchor_393:6_2144" id="FNanchor_393:6_2144"></a><a href="#Footnote_393:6_2144" class="fnanchor">[393:6]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>old</i> conception, which finds expression in the Decalogue in
Deuteronomy (v. 15), the Sabbath has a purely theocratic significance,
and is intended to remind the Hebrews of their miraculous deliverance
from the land of Egypt and bondage. When the story of <i>Creation</i> was
borrowed from the <i>Babylonians</i>, the celebration of the Sabbath was
established on entirely new grounds (Ex. xx. 11), for we find it is
because the "Creator," after his six days of work, rested on the
seventh, that the day should be kept holy.</p>

<p>The Assyrians kept this day holy. Mr. George Smith says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the year 1869, I discovered among other things a curious
religious calendar of the Assyrians, in which every month is
divided into four weeks, and the <i>seventh</i> days or
'<i>Sabbaths</i>,' are marked out as days on which no work should
be undertaken.<ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_393:7_2145" id="FNanchor_393:7_2145"></a><a href="#Footnote_393:7_2145" class="fnanchor">[393:7]</a></p></div>

<p>The ancient <i>Scandinavians</i> consecrated one day in the week to their
Supreme God, <i>Odin</i> or <i>Wodin</i>.<a name="FNanchor_393:8_2146" id="FNanchor_393:8_2146"></a><a href="#Footnote_393:8_2146" class="fnanchor">[393:8]</a> Even at the present time we call
this day <i>Odin's-day</i>.<a name="FNanchor_393:9_2147" id="FNanchor_393:9_2147"></a><a href="#Footnote_393:9_2147" class="fnanchor">[393:9]</a></p>

<p>The question now arises, how was the great festival day changed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>from
the <i>seventh</i>&mdash;Saturn's day&mdash;to the <i>first</i>&mdash;<i>Sun</i>-day&mdash;among the
Christians?</p>

<p>"If we go back to the founding of the church, we find that the most
marked feature of that age, so far as the church itself is concerned, is
the grand division between the 'Jewish faction,' as it was called, and
the followers of Paul. This division was so deep, so marked, so
characteristic, that it has left its traces all through the New
Testament itself. It was one of the grand aspects of the time, and the
point on which they were divided was simply this: the followers of
Peter, those who adhered to the teachings of the central church in
Jerusalem, held that all Christians, both converted Jews and Gentiles,
were under obligation to keep the Mosaic law, ordinances, and
traditions. That is, a Christian, according to their definition, was
first a Jew; Christianity was something <i>added to</i> that, not something
taking the place of it.</p>

<p>"We find this controversy raging violently all through the early
churches, and splitting them into factions, so that they were the
occasion of prayer and counsel. Paul took the ground distinctly that
Christianity, while it might be spiritually the lineal successor of
Judaism, was not Judaism; and that he who became a Christian, whether a
converted Jew or Gentile, was under no obligation whatever to keep the
Jewish law, so far as it was separate from practical matters of life and
character. We find this intimated in the writings of Paul; for we have
to go to the New Testament for the origin of that which, we find,
existed immediately after the New Testament was written. Paul says: 'One
man esteemeth one day above another: another man esteemeth every day
alike' (Rom. xiv. 5-9). He leaves it an open question; they can do as
they please. Then: 'Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. I
am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain' (Gal. iv.
10, 11). And if you will note this Epistle of Paul to the Galatians, you
will find that the whole purpose of his writing it was to protest
against what he believed to be the viciousness of the Judaizing
influences. That is, he says: 'I have come to preach to you the perfect
truth, that Christ hath made us free; and you are going back and taking
upon yourselves this yoke of bondage. My labor is being thrown away; my
efforts have been in vain.' Then he says, in his celebrated Epistle to
the Colossians, that has never yet been explained away or met: 'Let no
man therefore judge you any more in meat, or in drink, or in respect of
an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days' (Col. ii. 16,
17), distinctly abrogating the binding authority of the Sabbath on the
Christian church. So that, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>if Paul's word anywhere means anything&mdash;if
his authority is to be taken as of binding force on any point
whatever&mdash;then Paul is to be regarded as authoritatively and distinctly
abrogating the Sabbath, and declaring that it is no longer binding on
the Christian church."<a name="FNanchor_395:1_2148" id="FNanchor_395:1_2148"></a><a href="#Footnote_395:1_2148" class="fnanchor">[395:1]</a></p>

<p>This breach in the early church, this controversy, resulted at last in
Paul's going up to Jerusalem "to meet James and the representatives of
the Jerusalem church, to see if they could find any common platform of
agreement&mdash;if they could come together so that they could work with
mutual respect and without any further bickering. What is the platform
that they met upon? It was distinctly understood that those who wished
to keep up the observance of Judaism should do so; and the church at
Jerusalem gave Paul this grand freedom, substantially saying to him: 'Go
back to your missionary work, found churches, and teach them that they
are perfectly free in regard to all Mosaic and Jewish observances, save
only these four: Abstain from pollutions of idols, from fornication,
from things strangled, and from blood."<a name="FNanchor_395:2_2149" id="FNanchor_395:2_2149"></a><a href="#Footnote_395:2_2149" class="fnanchor">[395:2]</a></p>

<p>The point to which our attention is forcibly drawn is, that the question
of Sabbath-keeping is one of those that is left out. The point that Paul
had been fighting for was conceded by the central church at Jerusalem,
and he was to go out thenceforth free, so far as that was concerned, in
his teaching of the churches that he should found.</p>

<p>There is no mention of the Sabbath, or the Lord's day, as binding in the
New Testament. What, then, was the actual condition of affairs? What did
the churches do in the first three hundred years of their existence?
Why, they did just what Paul and the Jerusalem church had agreed upon.
Those who wished to keep the Jewish Sabbath did so; and those who did
not wish to, did not do so. This is seen from the fact that Justin
Martyr, a Christian Father who flourished about <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 140, did not
observe the day. In his "Dialogue" with Typho, the Jew reproaches the
Christians for not keeping the "Sabbath." Justin admits the charge by
saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Do you not see that the Elements keep no Sabbaths and are
never idle? Continue as you were created. If there was no need
of circumcision before Abraham's time, and no need of the
Sabbath, of festivals and oblations, before the time of Moses,
<i>neither of them are necessary after the coming of Christ</i>. If
any among you is guilty of perjury, fraud, or other crimes,
let him cease from them and repent, and he will have kept
<i>the</i> kind of Sabbath pleasing to God."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p><p>There was no binding authority then, among the Christians, as to
whether they should keep the first or the seventh day of the week holy,
or not, until the time of the first Christian Roman Emperor.
"<i>Constantine, a Sun worshiper, who had, as other Heathen, kept the
Sun-day, publicly ordered this to supplant the Jewish Sabbath.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_396:1_2150" id="FNanchor_396:1_2150"></a><a href="#Footnote_396:1_2150" class="fnanchor">[396:1]</a>
He commanded that this day should be kept holy, throughout the whole
Roman empire, and sent an edict to all governors of provinces to this
effect.<a name="FNanchor_396:2_2151" id="FNanchor_396:2_2151"></a><a href="#Footnote_396:2_2151" class="fnanchor">[396:2]</a> <i>Thus we see how the great Pagan festival, in honor of
Sol the invincible, was transformed into a Christian holy-day.</i></p>

<p>Not only were Pagan festival days changed into Christian holy-days, but
Pagan idols were converted into Christian saints, and Pagan temples into
Christian churches.</p>

<p>A Pagan temple at Rome, formerly sacred to the "<i>Bona Dea</i>" (the "Good
Goddess"), was Christianized and dedicated to the Virgin Mary. In a
place formerly sacred to Apollo, there now stands the church of Saint
Apollinaris. Where there anciently stood the temple of Mars, may now be
seen the church of Saint Martine.<a name="FNanchor_396:3_2152" id="FNanchor_396:3_2152"></a><a href="#Footnote_396:3_2152" class="fnanchor">[396:3]</a> A Pagan temple, originally
dedicated to "<i>C&aelig;lestis Dea</i>" (the "Heavenly Goddess"), by one Aurelius,
a Pagan high-priest, was converted into a Christian church by another
Aurelius, created Bishop of Carthage in the year 390 of Christ. He
placed his episcopal chair in the very place where the statue of the
Heavenly Goddess had stood.<a name="FNanchor_396:4_2153" id="FNanchor_396:4_2153"></a><a href="#Footnote_396:4_2153" class="fnanchor">[396:4]</a></p>

<p>The noblest heathen temple now remaining in the world, is the <i>Pantheon</i>
or <i>Rotunda</i>, which, as the inscription over the portico informs us,
having been <i>impiously</i> dedicated of old by Agrippa to "Jove and all the
gods," was <i>piously</i> reconsecrated by Pope Boniface the Fourth, to "The
Mother of God and all the Saints."<a name="FNanchor_396:5_2154" id="FNanchor_396:5_2154"></a><a href="#Footnote_396:5_2154" class="fnanchor">[396:5]</a></p>

<p>The church of Saint Reparatae, at Florence, was formerly a Pagan temple.
An inscription was found in the foundation of this church, of these
words: "To the Great Goddess Nutria."<a name="FNanchor_396:6_2155" id="FNanchor_396:6_2155"></a><a href="#Footnote_396:6_2155" class="fnanchor">[396:6]</a> The church of St. Stephen,
at Bologna, was formed from heathen temples, one of which was a temple
of Isis.<a name="FNanchor_396:7_2156" id="FNanchor_396:7_2156"></a><a href="#Footnote_396:7_2156" class="fnanchor">[396:7]</a></p>

<p>At the southern extremity of the present Forum at Rome, and just under
the Palatine hill&mdash;where the noble babes, who, miraculously preserved,
became the founders of a state that was to command the world, were
exposed&mdash;stands the church of St. Theodore.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p><p>This temple was built in honor of Romulus, and the brazen
wolf&mdash;commemorating the curious manner in which the founders of Rome
were nurtured&mdash;occupied a place here till the sixteenth century. And, as
the Roman matrons of old used to carry their children, when ill, to the
temple of Romulus, so too, the women still carry their children to St.

<p>In <i>Christianizing</i> these Pagan temples, free use was made of the
sculptured and painted stones of heathen monuments. In some cases they
evidently painted over one name, and inserted another. This may be seen
from the following</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Olympus was restored, but the divinities passed under other

of their time-honored conceptions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Not only was the
adoration of <i>ISIS</i> under a new name restored, but even her
image, standing on the crescent moon, reappeared. The
well-known effigy of that goddess with the infant Horus in her
arms, has descended to our days in the beautiful, artistic
creations of the Madonna and child. Such restorations of old
conceptions under novel forms were everywhere received with
delight. When it was announced to the Ephesians, that the
Council of that place, headed by Cyril, had declared that the
Virgin (Mary) should be called the '<i>Mother of God</i>,' with
tears of joy they embraced the knees of their bishop; it was
the old instinct cropping out; their ancestors would have done
the same for Diana."<a name="FNanchor_398:2_2162" id="FNanchor_398:2_2162"></a><a href="#Footnote_398:2_2162" class="fnanchor">[398:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople from 428 <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span>, refused to call Mary
"<i>the mother of God</i>," on the ground that she could be the mother of the
human nature only, which the divine Logos used as its organ. Cyril,
Bishop of Alexandria, did all in his power to stir up the minds of the
people against Nestorius; the consequence was that, both at Rome and at
Alexandria, Nestorius was accused of heresy. The dispute grew more
bitter, and Theodosius II. thought it necessary to convoke an
&OElig;cumenical Council at Ephesus in 431. On this, as on former
occasions, the affirmative party overruled the negative. The person of
Mary began to rise in the new empyrean. The paradoxical name of "<i>Mother
of God</i>" pleased the popular piety. Nestorius was condemned, and died in
exile.</p>

<p>The shrine of many an old hero was filled by the statue of some
imaginary saint.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They have not always" (says Dr. Conyers Middleton), "as I am
well informed, given themselves the trouble of making even
this change, but have been contented sometimes to take up with

only, as it were, or consecrating it anew, by the imposition
of a Christian name. This their antiquaries do not scruple to
put strangers in mind of, in showing their churches, as it
was, I think, in that of St. Agnes, where they showed me an
antique statue of a young <i>BACCHUS</i>, which, with a new name,
and some little change of drapery, stands now worshiped under

away the sins of the world," which, as we have already seen, was

casket. The depositories were all ransacked. The shadowy hands of
Egyptian priests placed the urn of holy water at the porch of the
basilica, which stood ready to be converted into a temple. Priests of
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>most ancient faiths of Palestine, Assyria, Babylon, Thebes, Persia
were permitted to erect the altar at the point where the transverse beam
of the cross meets the main stem. The hands that constructed the temple
in cruciform shape had long become too attenuated to cast the faintest
shadow. There Devaki with the infant Crishna, Maya with the babe Buddha,
Juno with the child Mars, represent Mary with Jesus in her arms. Coarse
emblems are not rejected; the Assyrian dove is a tender symbol of the
Holy Ghost. The rag-bags and toy boxes were explored. A bauble which the
Roman schoolboy had thrown away was picked up, and called an '<i>agnus
dei</i>.' The musty wardrobes of forgotten hierarchies furnished costumes
for the officers of the new prince. Alb and chasuble recalled the
fashions of Numa's day. The cast-off purple habits and shoes of Pagan
emperors beautified the august persons of Christian popes. The cardinals
must be contented with the robes once worn by senators. Zoroaster bound
about the monks the girdle he invented as a protection against evil
spirits, and clothed them in the frocks he had found convenient for his
ritual. The pope thrust out his foot to be kissed, as Caligula,
Heliogabalus, and Julius Cesar had thrust out theirs. Nothing came amiss
to the faith that was to discharge henceforth the offices of spiritual
impression."<a name="FNanchor_400:1_2168" id="FNanchor_400:1_2168"></a><a href="#Footnote_400:1_2168" class="fnanchor">[400:1]</a></p>

<p>The ascetic and monastic life practiced by some Christians of the
present day, is of great antiquity. Among the Buddhists there are
priests who are ordained, tonsured, live in monasteries, and make vows
of celibacy. There are also nuns among them, whose vows and discipline
are the same as the priests.<a name="FNanchor_400:2_2169" id="FNanchor_400:2_2169"></a><a href="#Footnote_400:2_2169" class="fnanchor">[400:2]</a></p>

<p>The close resemblance between the ancient religion of <i>Thibet</i> and
<i>Nepaul</i>&mdash;where the worship of a crucified God was found&mdash;and the Roman
Catholic religion of the present day, is very striking. In Thibet was
found the pope, or head of the religion, whom they called the "Dalai
Lama;"<a name="FNanchor_400:3_2170" id="FNanchor_400:3_2170"></a><a href="#Footnote_400:3_2170" class="fnanchor">[400:3]</a> they use holy water, they celebrate a sacrifice with bread
and wine; they give extreme unction, pray for the sick; they have
monasteries, and convents for women; they chant in their services, have
fasts; they worship one God in a trinity, believe in a hell, heaven, and
a half-way place or purgatory; they make prayers and sacrifices for the
dead, have confession, adore the cross; have chaplets, or strings of
beads to count their prayers, and many other practices common to the
Roman Catholic Church.<a name="FNanchor_400:4_2171" id="FNanchor_400:4_2171"></a><a href="#Footnote_400:4_2171" class="fnanchor">[400:4]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p><p>The resemblance between Buddhism and Christianity has been remarked by
many travelers in the eastern countries. Sir John Francis Davis, in his
"History of China," speaking of Buddhism in that country, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Certain it is&mdash;and the observance may be daily made even at
Canton&mdash;that they (the Buddhist priests) practice the
ordinances of celibacy, fasting, and prayers for the dead;
they have holy water, rosaries of beads, which they count with
their prayers, the worship of relics, and a monastic habit
resembling that of the Franciscans" (an order of Roman
Catholic monks).</p></div>

<p>P&egrave;re Premere, a Jesuit missionary to China, was driven to conclude that
the devil had practiced a trick to perplex his friends, the Jesuits. To
others, however, it is not so difficult to account for these things as
it seemed for the good Father. Sir John continues his account as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"These priests are associated in monasteries attached to the
temples of Fo. They are in China precisely a society of
mendicants, and go about, like monks of that description in
the Romish Church, asking alms for the support of their
establishment. Their tonsure extends to the hair of the whole
head. There is a regular gradation among the priesthood; and
according to his reputation for sanctity, his length of
service and other claims, each priest may rise from the lowest
rank of servitor&mdash;whose duty it is to perform the menial
offices of the temple&mdash;to that of officiating priest&mdash;and
ultimately of 'Tae Hoepang,' Abbot or head of the
establishment."</p></div>

<p>The five principal precepts, or rather interdicts, addressed to the
Buddhist priests are:</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>1. Do not kill.</li>
  <li>2. Do not steal.</li>
  <li>3. Do not marry.</li>
  <li>4. Speak not falsely.</li>
  <li>5. Drink no wine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Poo-ta-la is the name of a monastery, described in Lord Macartney's
mission, and is an extensive establishment, which was found in
Manchow-Tartary, beyond the great wall. This building offered shelter to
no less than eight hundred Chinese Buddhist priests.<a name="FNanchor_401:1_2172" id="FNanchor_401:1_2172"></a><a href="#Footnote_401:1_2172" class="fnanchor">[401:1]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Gutzlaff, in his "Journal of Voyages along the coast of
China," tells us that he found the Buddhist "Monasteries, nuns, and
friars very numerous;" and adds that: "their priests are generally very
ignorant."<a name="FNanchor_401:2_2173" id="FNanchor_401:2_2173"></a><a href="#Footnote_401:2_2173" class="fnanchor">[401:2]</a></p>

<p>This reminds us of the fact that, for centuries during the "dark ages"
of Christianity, Christian bishops and prelates, the teachers, spiritual
pastors and masters, were mostly <i>marksmen</i>, that is, they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>supplied, by
the sign of the cross, their inability to write their own name.<a name="FNanchor_402:1_2174" id="FNanchor_402:1_2174"></a><a href="#Footnote_402:1_2174" class="fnanchor">[402:1]</a>
Many of the bishops in the Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon, it is
said, could not write their names. Ignorance was not considered a
disqualification for ordination. A cloud of ignorance overspread the
whole face of the Church, hardly broken by a few glimmering lights, who
owe almost the whole of their distinction to the surrounding
darkness.<a name="FNanchor_402:2_2175" id="FNanchor_402:2_2175"></a><a href="#Footnote_402:2_2175" class="fnanchor">[402:2]</a></p>

<p>One of the principal objects of curiosity to the Europeans who first
went to China, was a large monastery at Canton. This monastery, which
was dedicated to Fo, or Buddha, and which is on a very large scale, is
situated upon the southern side of the river. There are extensive
grounds surrounding the building, planted with trees, in the center of
which is a broad pavement of granite, which is kept very clean. An
English gentleman, Mr. Bennett, entered this establishment, which he
fully describes. He says that after walking along this granite pavement,
they entered a temple, where the priesthood happened to be assembled,
worshiping. They were arranged in rows, chanting, striking gongs, &amp;c.
These priests, with their shaven crowns, and arrayed in the yellow robes
of the religion, appeared to go through the mummery with devotion. As
soon as the mummery had ceased, the priests all flocked out of the
temple, adjourned to their respective rooms, divested themselves of
their official robes, and the images&mdash;among which were evidently
representations of Shin-moo, the "Holy Mother," and "Queen of Heaven,"
and "The Three Pure Ones,"&mdash;were left to themselves, with lamps burning
before them.</p>

<p>To expiate sin, offerings made to these priests are&mdash;according to the
Buddhist idea&mdash;sufficient. To facilitate the release of some unfortunate
from purgatory, they said masses. Their prayers are counted by means of
a rosary, and they live in a state of celibacy.</p>

<p>Mr. Gutzlaff, in describing a temple dedicated to Buddha, situated on
the island of Poo-ta-la, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We were present at the vespers of the priests, which they
chanted in the Pali language, not unlike the Latin service of
the Romish church. They held their rosaries in their hands,
which rested folded upon their breasts. One of them had a
small bell, by the tingling of which the service was
regulated."</p></div>

<p>The Buddhists in <i>India</i> have similar institutions. The French
missionary, M. L'Abb&eacute; Huc, says of them:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Buddhist ascetic not aspiring to elevate himself only, he
practiced virtue and applied himself to perfection to make
other men share in its belief; and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>by the institution of an
order of religious mendicants, which increased to an immense
extent, he attached towards him, and restored to society, the
poor and unfortunate. It was, indeed, precisely because Buddha
received among his disciples miserable creatures who were
outcasts from the respectable class of India, that he became
an object of mockery to the Brahmins. But he merely replied to
their taunts, 'My law is a law of mercy for all.'"<a name="FNanchor_403:1_2176" id="FNanchor_403:1_2176"></a><a href="#Footnote_403:1_2176" class="fnanchor">[403:1]</a></p></div>

<p>In the words of Viscount Amberly, we can say that, "Monasticism, in
countries where Buddhism reigns supreme, is a vast and powerful
institution."</p>

<p>The <i>Essenes</i>, of whom we shall speak more fully anon, were an order of
ascetics, dwelling in monasteries. Among the order of Pythagoras, which
was very similar to the Essenes, there was an order of nuns.<a name="FNanchor_403:2_2177" id="FNanchor_403:2_2177"></a><a href="#Footnote_403:2_2177" class="fnanchor">[403:2]</a> The
ancient Druids admitted females into their sacred order, and initiated
them into the mysteries of their religion.<a name="FNanchor_403:3_2178" id="FNanchor_403:3_2178"></a><a href="#Footnote_403:3_2178" class="fnanchor">[403:3]</a> The priestesses of the
Saxon Frigga devoted themselves to perpetual virginity.<a name="FNanchor_403:4_2179" id="FNanchor_403:4_2179"></a><a href="#Footnote_403:4_2179" class="fnanchor">[403:4]</a> The
vestal virgins<a name="FNanchor_403:5_2180" id="FNanchor_403:5_2180"></a><a href="#Footnote_403:5_2180" class="fnanchor">[403:5]</a> were bound by a solemn vow to preserve their
chastity for a space of thirty years.<a name="FNanchor_403:6_2181" id="FNanchor_403:6_2181"></a><a href="#Footnote_403:6_2181" class="fnanchor">[403:6]</a></p>

<p>The Egyptian priests of Isis were obliged to observe perpetual
chastity.<a name="FNanchor_403:7_2182" id="FNanchor_403:7_2182"></a><a href="#Footnote_403:7_2182" class="fnanchor">[403:7]</a> They were also tonsured like the Buddhist
priests.<a name="FNanchor_403:8_2183" id="FNanchor_403:8_2183"></a><a href="#Footnote_403:8_2183" class="fnanchor">[403:8]</a> The Assyrian, Arabian, Persian and Egyptian priests wore

Aphrodite had her Hierodoulio, the pure Gerairai ministered to the
goddess of the Parthenon, the altar of the Latin Vesta was tended by her
chosen virgins, and the Romish "Queen of Heaven" has her nuns.</p>

<p>When the Spaniards had established themselves in Mexico and Peru, they
were astonished to find, among other things which closely resembled
their religion, <i>monastic institutions</i> on a large scale.</p>

<p>The Rev. Father Acosta, in his "Natural and Moral History of the
Indies," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is one thing worthy of special regard, the which is,
how the Devil, by his pride, hath opposed himself to God; and
that which God, by his wisdom, hath decreed for his honor and
service, and for the good and health of man, the devil strives
to imitate and pervert, to be honored, and to cause men to be
damned: for as we see the great God hath Sacrifices, Priests,
Sacraments, Religious Prophets, and Ministers, dedicated to
his divine service and holy ceremonies, so likewise the devil
hath his Sacrifices, Priests, his kinds of Sacraments, his
Ministers appointed, his secluded and feigned holiness, with a
thousand sorts of false prophets."<a name="FNanchor_403:10_2185" id="FNanchor_403:10_2185"></a><a href="#Footnote_403:10_2185" class="fnanchor">[403:10]</a></p>

<p>"We find among all the nations of the world, men especially
dedicated to the service of the true God, or to the false,
which serve in sacrifices, and declare <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>unto the people what
their gods command them. There was in Mexico a strange
curiosity upon this point. And the devil, counterfeiting the
use of the church of God, hath placed in the order of his
Priests, some greater or superiors, and some less, the one as
Acolites, the other as Levites, and that which hath made most
to wonder, was, that the devil would usurp to himself the
service of God; yea, and use the same name: for the Mexicans
in their ancient tongue call their high priests <i>Papes</i>, as
they should say sovereign bishops, as it appears now by their
histories."<a name="FNanchor_404:1_2186" id="FNanchor_404:1_2186"></a><a href="#Footnote_404:1_2186" class="fnanchor">[404:1]</a></p></div>

<p>In Mexico, within the circuit of the great temple, there were two
monasteries, one for virgins, the other for men, which they called
religious. These men lived poorly and chastely, and did the office of
Levites.<a name="FNanchor_404:2_2187" id="FNanchor_404:2_2187"></a><a href="#Footnote_404:2_2187" class="fnanchor">[404:2]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"These priests and religious men used great fastings, of five
or ten days together, before any of their great feasts, and
they were unto them as our four ember week; they were so
strict in continence that some of them (not to fall into any
sensuality) slit their members in the midst, and did a
thousand things to make themselves unable, lest they should
offend their gods."<a name="FNanchor_404:3_2188" id="FNanchor_404:3_2188"></a><a href="#Footnote_404:3_2188" class="fnanchor">[404:3]</a></p>

<p>"There were in Peru many monasteries of virgins (for there are
no other admitted), at the least one in every province. In
these monasteries there were two sorts of women, one ancient,
which they called Mamacomas (mothers), for the instruction of
the young, and the other was of young maidens placed there for
a certain time, and after they were drawn forth, either for
their gods or for the Inca." "If any of the Mamacomas or
Acllas were found to have trespassed against their honor, it
was an inevitable chastisement to bury them alive or to put
them to death by some other kind of cruel torment."<a name="FNanchor_404:4_2189" id="FNanchor_404:4_2189"></a><a href="#Footnote_404:4_2189" class="fnanchor">[404:4]</a></p></div>

<p>The Rev. Father concludes by saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In truth it is very strange to see that this false opinion of
religion hath so great force among these young men and maidens
of Mexico, that they will serve the devil with so great rigor
and austerity, which many of us do not in the service of the
most high God, the which is a great shame and
confusion."<a name="FNanchor_404:5_2190" id="FNanchor_404:5_2190"></a><a href="#Footnote_404:5_2190" class="fnanchor">[404:5]</a></p></div>

<p>The religious orders of the ancient Mexicans and Peruvians are described
at length in Lord Kingsborough's "Mexican Antiquities," and by most
every writer on ancient Mexico. Differing in minor details, the grand
features of self-consecration are everywhere the same, whether we look
to the saintly Rishis of ancient India, to the wearers of the yellow
robe in China or Ceylon, to the Essenes among the Jews, to the devotees
of Vitziliputzli in pagan Mexico, or to the monks and nuns of Christian
times in Africa, in Asia, and in Europe. Throughout the various creeds
of these distant lands there runs the same unconquerable impulse,
producing the same remarkable effects.</p>

<p>The "<i>Sacred Heart</i>," was a great mystery with the ancients.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p><p><i>Horus</i>, the Egyptian virgin-born Saviour, was represented carrying the
sacred heart outside on his breast. <i>Vishnu</i>, the Mediator and Preserver
of the Hindoos, was also represented in that manner. So was it with
<i>Bel</i> of Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_405:1_2191" id="FNanchor_405:1_2191"></a><a href="#Footnote_405:1_2191" class="fnanchor">[405:1]</a> In like manner, Christ Jesus, the Christian
Saviour, is represented at the present day.</p>

<p>The amulets or charms which the Roman Christians wear, to drive away
diseases, and to protect them from harm, are other relics of paganism.
The ancient pagans wore these charms for the same purpose. The name of
their favorite god was generally inscribed upon them, and we learn by a
quotation from Chrysostom that the Christians at Antioch used to bind
brass coins of Alexander the Great about their heads, to keep off or
drive away diseases.<a name="FNanchor_405:2_2192" id="FNanchor_405:2_2192"></a><a href="#Footnote_405:2_2192" class="fnanchor">[405:2]</a> The Christians also used amulets with the
name or monogram of the god <i>Serapis</i> engraved thereon, which show that
it made no difference whether the god was their own or that of another.
Even the charm which is worn by the Christians at the present day, has
none other than the monogram of <i>Bacchus</i> engraved thereon, <i>i. e.</i>, I.
H. S.<a name="FNanchor_405:3_2193" id="FNanchor_405:3_2193"></a><a href="#Footnote_405:3_2193" class="fnanchor">[405:3]</a></p>

<p>The ancient Roman children carried around their necks a small ornament
in the form of a heart, called <i>Bulla</i>. This was imitated by the early
Christians. Upon their ancient monuments in the Vatican, the heart is
very common, and it may be seen in numbers of old pictures. After some
time it was succeeded by the <i>Agnus Dei</i>, which, like the ancient
<i>Bulla</i>, was supposed to avert dangers from the children and the wearers
of them. Cardinal <ins class="corr" title="original has Baronias">Baronius</ins> (an eminent Roman Catholic ecclesiastical
historian, born at Sora, in Naples, <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 1538) says, that those who
have been baptized carry pendent from their neck an <i>Agnus Dei</i>, in
imitation of a devotion of the Pagans, who hung to the neck of their
children little bottles in the form of a heart, which served as
preservatives against charms and enchantments. Says Mr. Cox:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That ornaments in the shape of a <i>vesica</i> have been popular
in all countries as preservatives against dangers, and
especially from evil spirits, can as little be questioned as
the fact that they still retain some measure of their ancient
popularity in England, where horse-shoes are nailed to walls
as a safeguard against unknown perils, where a shoe is thrown
by way of good-luck after newly-married couples, and where the
villagers have not yet ceased to dance round the May-pole on
the green."<a name="FNanchor_405:4_2194" id="FNanchor_405:4_2194"></a><a href="#Footnote_405:4_2194" class="fnanchor">[405:4]</a></p></div>

<p>All of these are emblems of either the <ins class="corr" title="original has Lingha">Linga</ins> or Yoni.</p>

<p>The use of amulets was carried to the most extravagant excess <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>in
ancient Egypt, and their Sacred Book of the Dead, even in its earliest
form, shows the importance attached to such things.<a name="FNanchor_406:1_2195" id="FNanchor_406:1_2195"></a><a href="#Footnote_406:1_2195" class="fnanchor">[406:1]</a></p>

<p>We can say with M. Renan that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Almost all our superstitions are the remains of a religion
anterior to Christianity, and which Christianity has not been
able entirely to root out."<a name="FNanchor_406:2_2196" id="FNanchor_406:2_2196"></a><a href="#Footnote_406:2_2196" class="fnanchor">[406:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Baptismal fonts were used by the pagans, as well as the little cisterns
which are to be seen at the entrance of Catholic churches. In the temple
of Apollo, at Delphi, there were two of these; one of silver, and the
other of gold.<a name="FNanchor_406:3_2197" id="FNanchor_406:3_2197"></a><a href="#Footnote_406:3_2197" class="fnanchor">[406:3]</a></p>

<p>Temples always faced the east, to receive the rays of the rising sun.
They contained an outer court for the public, and an inner sanctuary for
the priests, called the "<i>Adytum</i>." Near the entrance was a large
vessel, of stone or brass, filled with water, made holy by plunging into
it a burning torch from the altar. All who were admitted to the
sacrifices were sprinkled with this water, and none but the unpolluted
were allowed to pass beyond it. In the center of the building stood the
statue of the god, on a pedestal raised above the altar and enclosed by
a railing. On festival occasions, the people brought laurel, olive, or
ivy, to decorate the pillars and walls. Before they entered they always
washed their hands, as a type of purification from sin.<a name="FNanchor_406:4_2198" id="FNanchor_406:4_2198"></a><a href="#Footnote_406:4_2198" class="fnanchor">[406:4]</a> A story
is told of a man who was struck dead by a thunderbolt because he omitted
this ceremony when entering a temple of Jupiter. Sometimes they crawled
up the steps on their knees, and bowing their heads to the ground,
kissed the threshold. Always when they passed one of these sacred
edifices they kissed their right hand to it, in token of veneration.</p>

<p>In all the temples of Vishnu, Crishna, Rama, Durga, and Kali, in India,
there are to be seen idols before which lights and incense are burned.
Moreover, the idols of these gods are constantly decorated with flowers
and costly ornaments, especially on festive occasions.<a name="FNanchor_406:5_2199" id="FNanchor_406:5_2199"></a><a href="#Footnote_406:5_2199" class="fnanchor">[406:5]</a> The
ancient Egyptian worship had a great splendor of ritual. There was a
morning service, a kind of mass, celebrated by a priest, shorn and
beardless; there were sprinklings of holy water, &amp;c., &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_406:6_2200" id="FNanchor_406:6_2200"></a><a href="#Footnote_406:6_2200" class="fnanchor">[406:6]</a> All of
this kind of worship was finally adopted by the Christians.</p>

<p>The sublime and simple theology of the primitive Christians <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>was
gradually corrupted and degraded by the introduction of a popular
mythology, which tended to restore the reign of polytheism.</p>

<p>As the objects of religion were gradually reduced to the standard of the
imagination, the rites and ceremonies were introduced that seemed most
powerfully to affect the senses of the vulgar. If, in the beginning of
the fifth century, Tertullian, or Lactantius, had been suddenly raised
from the dead, to assist at the festival of some popular saint or
martyr, they would have gazed with astonishment and indignation on the
profane spectacle, which had succeeded to the pure and spiritual worship
of a Christian congregation.<a name="FNanchor_407:1_2201" id="FNanchor_407:1_2201"></a><a href="#Footnote_407:1_2201" class="fnanchor">[407:1]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Draper, in speaking of the early Christian Church, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Great is the difference between Christianity under Severus
(born 146) and Christianity under Constantine (born 274). Many
of the doctrines which at the latter period were pre-eminent,
in the former were unknown. Two causes led to the amalgamation
of Christianity with Paganism. 1. The political necessities of
the new dynasty: 2. The policy adopted by the new religion to
insure its spread.</p>

<p>"Though the Christian party had proved itself sufficiently
strong to give a master to the empire, it was never
sufficiently strong to destroy its antagonist, Paganism. The
issue of the struggle between them <i>was an amalgamation of the
principles of both</i>. In this, Christianity differed from
Mohammedanism, which absolutely annihilated its antagonist,
and spread its own doctrines without adulteration.</p>

<p>"Constantine continually showed by his acts that he felt he
must be the impartial sovereign of all his people, not merely
the representative of a successful faction. Hence, if he built
Christian churches, he also restored Pagan temples; if he
listened to the clergy, he also consulted the haruspices; if
he summoned the Council of Nicea, he also honored the statue
of Fortune; if he accepted the rite of Baptism, he also struck
a medal bearing his title of 'God.' His statue, on top of the
great porphyry pillar at Constantinople, consisted of an
ancient image of Apollo, whose features were replaced by those
of the emperor, and its head surrounded by the nails feigned
to have been used at the crucifixion of Christ, arranged so as
to form a crown of glory.</p>

<p>"Feeling that there must be concessions to the defeated Pagan
party, in accordance with its ideas, he looked with favor on
the idolatrous movements of his court. In fact, the leaders of
these movements were persons of his own family.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins>To the emperor,&mdash;a mere worldling&mdash;a man without any
religious convictions, doubtless it appeared best for himself,
best for the empire, and best for the contending parties,
Christian and Pagan, to promote their <i>union or amalgamation
as much as possible</i>. Even sincere Christians do not seem to
have been averse to this; perhaps they believed that the new
doctrines would diffuse most thoroughly by incorporating in
themselves ideas borrowed from the old; that Truth would
assert herself in the end, and the impurities be cast off. In
accomplishing this amalgamation, Helen, the Empress-mother,
aided by the court ladies, led the way.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>"As years passed on, the faith described by Tertullian (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span>
150-195) was transformed into one more fashionable and more
debased. It was incorporated with the old Greek mythology.
Olympus was restored, but the divinities passed under new
names.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Heathen rites were adopted, a pompous and splendid ritual,
gorgeous robes, mitres, tiaras, wax-tapers, processional
services, lustrations, gold and silver vases, were introduced.</p>

<p>"The festival of the Purification of the Virgin was invented
to remove the uneasiness of heathen converts on account of the
loss of their Lupercalia, or feasts of Pan.</p>

<p>"The apotheosis of the old Roman times was replaced by
canonization; tutelary <i>saints</i> succeeded to local
mythological divinities. Then came the mystery of
<i>transubstantiation</i>, or the conversion of bread and wine by
the priest into the flesh and blood of Christ. As centuries
passed, the <i>paganization</i> became more and more
complete."<a name="FNanchor_408:1_2202" id="FNanchor_408:1_2202"></a><a href="#Footnote_408:1_2202" class="fnanchor">[408:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The early Christian saints, bishops, and fathers, <i>confessedly</i> adopted
the liturgies, rites, ceremonies, and terms of heathenism; making it
their boast, that the pagan religion, properly explained, really was
nothing else than Christianity; that the best and wisest of its
professors, in all ages, had been Christians all along; that
Christianity was but a name more recently acquired to a religion which
had previously existed, and had been known to the Greek philosophers, to
Plato, Socrates, and Heraclitus; and that "if the writings of Cicero had
been read as they ought to have been, there would have been no occasion
for the Christian Scriptures."</p>

<p>And our Protestant, and most orthodox Christian divines, the best
learned on ecclesiastical antiquity, and most entirely persuaded of the
truth of the Christian religion, unable to resist or to conflict with
the constraining demonstration of the data that prove the absolute
sameness and identity of Paganism and Christianity, and unable to point
out so much as one single idea or notion, of which they could show that
it was peculiar to Christianity, or that Christianity had it, and
Paganism had it not, have invented the apology of an hypothesis, that
the Pagan religion was <i>typical</i>, and that Crishna, Buddha, Bacchus,
Hercules, Adonis, Osiris, Horus, &amp;c., were all of them <i>types</i> and
forerunners of the <i>true</i> and <i>real</i> Saviour, Christ Jesus. Those who
are satisfied with this kind of reasoning are certainly welcome to it.</p>

<p>That Christianity is nothing more than Paganism under a new name, has,
as we said above, been admitted over and over again by the Fathers of
the Church, and others. Aringhus (in his account of subterraneous Rome)
acknowledges the conformity between the Pagan and Christian form of
worship, and defends the admission <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>of the ceremonies of heathenism into
the service of the Church, by the authority of the wisest prelates and
governors, whom, he says, found it necessary, in the conversion of the
Gentiles, to dissemble, and wink at many things, and yield to the times;
and not to use force against customs which the people were so
obstinately fond of.<a name="FNanchor_409:1_2203" id="FNanchor_409:1_2203"></a><a href="#Footnote_409:1_2203" class="fnanchor">[409:1]</a></p>

<p>Melito (a Christian bishop of Sardis), in an <i>apology</i> delivered to the
Emperor Marcus Antoninus, in the year 170, claims the patronage of the
emperor, for the <i>now</i> called Christian religion, which he calls "<i>our
philosophy</i>," "on account of its <i>high antiquity</i>, as having been
<i>imported</i> from countries lying beyond the limits of the Roman empire,
in the region of his ancestor Augustus, who found its <i>importation</i>
ominous of good fortune to his government."<a name="FNanchor_409:2_2204" id="FNanchor_409:2_2204"></a><a href="#Footnote_409:2_2204" class="fnanchor">[409:2]</a> This is an absolute
demonstration that Christianity did <i>not</i> originate in Judea, which was
a Roman province, but really was an exotic oriental fable, <i>imported</i>
from India, and that Paul was doing as he claimed, viz.: preaching a God
manifest in the flesh who had been "believed on in the world" centuries
before his time, and a doctrine which had already been preached "unto
every creature under heaven."</p>

<p>Baronius (an eminent Catholic ecclesiastical historian) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is permitted to the Church to use, <i>for the purpose of
piety</i>, the ceremonies which the pagans used <i>for the purpose
of impiety</i> in a superstitious religion, after having first
expiated them by consecration&mdash;to the end, that the devil
might receive a greater affront from employing, in honor of
Jesus Christ, that which his enemy had destined for his own
service."<a name="FNanchor_409:3_2205" id="FNanchor_409:3_2205"></a><a href="#Footnote_409:3_2205" class="fnanchor">[409:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Clarke, in his "Evidences of Revealed Religion," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Some of the ancient writers of the church have not scrupled
expressly to call the Athenian <i>Socrates</i>, and some others of
the best of the <i>heathen moralists</i>, by the name of
<i>Christians</i>, and to affirm, as the law was as it were a
schoolmaster, to bring the Jews unto Christ, so true moral
philosophy was to the Gentiles a preparative to receive the
gospel."<a name="FNanchor_409:4_2206" id="FNanchor_409:4_2206"></a><a href="#Footnote_409:4_2206" class="fnanchor">[409:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Clemens Alexandrinus says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Those who lived according to the <i>Logos</i> were really
<i>Christians</i>, though they have been thought to be atheists; as
Socrates and Heraclitus were among the Greeks, and such as
resembled them."<a name="FNanchor_409:5_2207" id="FNanchor_409:5_2207"></a><a href="#Footnote_409:5_2207" class="fnanchor">[409:5]</a></p></div>

<p>And St. Augustine says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>That</i>, in our times, is the <i>Christian religion</i>, which to
know and follow is the most sure and certain health, called
according to that name, but not according <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>to the thing
itself, of which it is the name; for the thing itself which is
now called the <i>Christian religion</i>, really was known to the
ancients, nor was wanting at any time from the beginning of
the human race, until the time when Christ came in the flesh,
from whence the true religion, <i>which had previously existed</i>,
began to be called <i>Christian</i>; and this in our days is the
Christian religion, not as having been wanting in former
times, but as having in later times received this
name."<a name="FNanchor_410:1_2208" id="FNanchor_410:1_2208"></a><a href="#Footnote_410:1_2208" class="fnanchor">[410:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Eusebius, the great champion of Christianity, admits that that which is
called the Christian religion, is neither new nor strange, but&mdash;if it be
lawful to testify the truth&mdash;was known to the <i>ancients</i>.<a name="FNanchor_410:2_2209" id="FNanchor_410:2_2209"></a><a href="#Footnote_410:2_2209" class="fnanchor">[410:2]</a></p>

<p>How the common people were Christianized, we gather from a remarkable
passage which Mosheim, the ecclesiastical historian, has preserved for
us, in the life of Gregory, surnamed "<i>Thaumaturgus</i>," that is, "the
wonder worker." The passage is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When Gregory perceived that the simple and unskilled
multitude persisted in their worship of images, on account of
the pleasures and sensual gratifications which they enjoyed at
the Pagan festivals, <i>he granted them a permission to indulge
themselves in the like pleasures</i>, in celebrating the memory
of the holy martyrs, hoping that in process of time, they
would return of their own accord, to a more virtuous and
regular course of life."<a name="FNanchor_410:3_2210" id="FNanchor_410:3_2210"></a><a href="#Footnote_410:3_2210" class="fnanchor">[410:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The historian remarks that there is no sort of doubt, that by this
permission, Gregory allowed the Christians to dance, sport, and feast at
the tombs of the martyrs, upon their respective festivals, and to do
everything which the Pagans were accustomed to do in their temples,
during the feasts celebrated in honor of their gods.</p>

<p>The learned Christian advocate, M. Turretin, in describing the state of
Christianity in the fourth century, has a well-turned rhetoricism, the
point of which is, that "it was not so much the empire that was brought
over to the faith, as the faith that was brought over to the empire; not
the Pagans who were converted to Christianity, but Christianity that was
converted to Paganism."<a name="FNanchor_410:4_2211" id="FNanchor_410:4_2211"></a><a href="#Footnote_410:4_2211" class="fnanchor">[410:4]</a></p>

<p>Edward Gibbon says:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"It must be confessed that the ministers of the Catholic
church imitated the profane model which they were impatient to
destroy. The most respectable bishops had persuaded
themselves, that the ignorant rusties would more cheerfully
renounce the superstitions of Paganism, if they found some
resemblance, some compensation, in the bosom of Christianity.
The religion of Constantine achieved, in less than a century,
the final conquest of the Roman empire: <i>but the victors
themselves were insensibly subdued by the arts of their

<p>Faustus, writing to St. Augustine, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"You have substituted your agap&aelig; for the sacrifices of the
Pagans; for their idols your martyrs, whom you serve with the
very same honors. You appease the shades of the dead with wine
and feasts; you celebrate the solemn festivities of the

their manners, those you have retained without any alteration.
<i>Nothing distinguishes you from the Pagans, except that you

<p>Ammonius Saccus (a Greek philosopher, founder of the Neo-platonic
school) taught that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Christianity and Paganism, when rightly understood, differ in
no essential points, but had a common origin, <i>and are really
one and the same thing</i>."<a name="FNanchor_411:3_2214" id="FNanchor_411:3_2214"></a><a href="#Footnote_411:3_2214" class="fnanchor">[411:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Justin explains the thing in the following manner:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It having reached the devil's ears that the prophets had
foretold that Christ would come .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he (the devil) set the
heathen poets to bring forward a great many who should be
called sons of Jove, (<i>i. e.</i>, "The Sons of God.") The devil
laying his scheme in this, to get men to imagine that the
<i>true</i> history of Christ was of the same character as the
prodigious fables and poetic stories."<a name="FNanchor_411:4_2215" id="FNanchor_411:4_2215"></a><a href="#Footnote_411:4_2215" class="fnanchor">[411:4]</a></p></div>

<p>C&aelig;cilius, in the Octavius of Minucius Felix, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"All these fragments of crack-brained opiniatry and silly
solaces played off in the sweetness of song by (the) deceitful
(Pagan) poets, by you too credulous creatures (<i>i. e.</i>, the
Christians) have been shamefully reformed and made over to
your own god."<a name="FNanchor_411:5_2216" id="FNanchor_411:5_2216"></a><a href="#Footnote_411:5_2216" class="fnanchor">[411:5]</a></p></div>

<p>Celsus, the Epicurean philosopher, wrote that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Christian religion contains nothing but what Christians
hold in common with heathens; nothing new, or truly
great."<a name="FNanchor_411:6_2217" id="FNanchor_411:6_2217"></a><a href="#Footnote_411:6_2217" class="fnanchor">[411:6]</a></p></div>

<p>This assertion is fully verified by Justin Martyr, in his apology to the
Emperor Adrian, which is one of the most remarkable admissions ever made
by a Christian writer. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In saying that all things were made in this beautiful order
by God, what do we seem to say more than Plato? When we teach
a general conflagration, what do we teach more than the
Stoics? By opposing the worship of the works of men's hands,
we concur with Menander, the comedian; and by declaring the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>Logos, the first begotten of God, our master Jesus Christ, to
be born of a virgin, without any human mixture, to be
crucified and dead, and to have rose again, and ascended into
heaven: <i>we say no more in this, than what you say of those
whom you style the Sons of Jove</i>. For you need not be told
what a parcel of sons, the writers most in vogue among you,
assign to Jove; there's Mercury, Jove's interpreter, in
imitation of the Logos, in worship among you. There's
&AElig;sculapius, the physician, smitten by a thunderbolt, and after
that ascending into heaven. There's Bacchus, torn to pieces;
and Hercules, burnt to get rid of his pains. There's Pollux
and Castor, the sons of Jove by Leda, and Perseus by Danae;
and not to mention others, I would fain know why you always
deify the departed emperors and have a fellow at hand to make
affidavit that he saw C&aelig;sar mount to heaven from the funeral
pile?</p>

<p>"As to the son of God, called Jesus, should we allow him to be
nothing more than man, yet the title of the son of God is very
justifiable, upon the account of his wisdom, considering that
you have your Mercury in worship, under the title of the Word
and Messenger of God.</p>

<p>"<i>As to the objection of our Jesus's being crucified</i>, I say,
that suffering was common to all the forementioned sons of
Jove, but only they suffered another kind of death. As to his
being born of a virgin, you have your Perseus to balance that.
As to his curing the lame, and the paralytic, and such as were
cripples from birth, this is little more than what you say of
your &AElig;sculapius."<a name="FNanchor_412:1_2218" id="FNanchor_412:1_2218"></a><a href="#Footnote_412:1_2218" class="fnanchor">[412:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The most celebrated Fathers of the Christian church, the most frequently
quoted, and those whose names stand the highest were nothing more nor
less than Pagans, being born and educated Pagans. Pantaenus (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 193)
was one of these half-Pagan, half-Christian, Fathers. He at one time
presided in the school of the faithful in <i>Alexandria</i> in Egypt, and was
celebrated on account of his learning. He was brought up in the Stoic
philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_412:2_2219" id="FNanchor_412:2_2219"></a><a href="#Footnote_412:2_2219" class="fnanchor">[412:2]</a></p>

<p>Clemens Alexandrinus (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 194) or St. Clement of Alexandria, was
another Christian Father of the same sort, being originally a Pagan. He
succeeded Pantaenus as president of the <i>monkish</i> university at
Alexandria. His works are very extensive, and his authority very high in
the church.<a name="FNanchor_412:3_2220" id="FNanchor_412:3_2220"></a><a href="#Footnote_412:3_2220" class="fnanchor">[412:3]</a></p>

<p>Tertullian (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 200) may next be mentioned. He also was originally a
Pagan, and at one time Presbyter of the Christian church of Carthage, in
Africa. The following is a specimen of his manner of reasoning on the
evidences of Christianity. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I find no other means to prove myself to be impudent with
success, and happily a fool, than by my contempt of shame; as,
for instance&mdash;I maintain that the Son of God was born; why am
I not ashamed of maintaining such a thing? Why! but because it
is itself a shameful thing. I maintain that the Son of God
died: well, that is wholly credible because it is monstrously
absurd. I maintain that after having been buried, he rose
again: and that I take to be absolutely true, because it was

was another Father of this class. Porphyry (a Neo-platonist philosopher)
objects to him on this account.<a name="FNanchor_413:1_2222" id="FNanchor_413:1_2222"></a><a href="#Footnote_413:1_2222" class="fnanchor">[413:1]</a></p>

<p>He also was born in the great cradle and nursery of
superstition&mdash;Egypt&mdash;and studied under that celebrated philosopher,
Ammonius Saccus, who taught that "Christianity and Paganism, when
rightly understood, differed in no essential point, but had a common
origin." This man was so sincere in his devotion to the cause of
monkery, or Essenism, that he made himself an eunuch "for the kingdom of
heaven's sake."<a name="FNanchor_413:2_2223" id="FNanchor_413:2_2223"></a><a href="#Footnote_413:2_2223" class="fnanchor">[413:2]</a> The writer of the twelfth verse of the nineteenth
chapter of Matthew, was without doubt an Egyptian monk. The words are
put into the mouth of the <i>Jewish</i> Jesus, which is simply ridiculous,
when it is considered that the Jews did not allow an eunuch so much as
to enter the congregation of the Lord.<a name="FNanchor_413:3_2224" id="FNanchor_413:3_2224"></a><a href="#Footnote_413:3_2224" class="fnanchor">[413:3]</a></p>

<p>St. Gregory (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 240), bishop of Neo-C&aelig;sarea in Pontus, was another
celebrated Christian Father, born of Pagan parents and educated a Pagan.
He is called Thaumaturgus, or the wonder-worker, and is said to have
performed miracles when still a Pagan.<a name="FNanchor_413:4_2225" id="FNanchor_413:4_2225"></a><a href="#Footnote_413:4_2225" class="fnanchor">[413:4]</a> He, too, was an
Alexandrian student. This is the Gregory who was commended by his
namesake of Nyssa for changing the Pagan festivals into Christian
holidays, the better to draw the heathen to the religion of
Christ.<a name="FNanchor_413:5_2226" id="FNanchor_413:5_2226"></a><a href="#Footnote_413:5_2226" class="fnanchor">[413:5]</a></p>

<p>Mosheim, the ecclesiastical historian, in speaking of the Christian
church during the second century, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The profound respect that was paid to the Greek and Roman
<i>mysteries</i>, and the extraordinary sanctity that was
attributed to them, induced the Christians to give their
religion a <i>mystic</i> air, in order to put it upon an equal
footing, in point of dignity, with that of the Pagans. For
this purpose they gave the name of <i>mysteries</i> to the
institutions of the gospel, and decorated, particularly the
holy sacrament, with that solemn title. They used, in that
sacred institution, as also in that of baptism, several of the
terms employed in the heathen mysteries, and proceeded so far
at length, as even to adopt some of the rites and ceremonies
of which those renowned mysteries consisted."<a name="FNanchor_413:6_2227" id="FNanchor_413:6_2227"></a><a href="#Footnote_413:6_2227" class="fnanchor">[413:6]</a></p></div>

<p>We have seen, then, that the only difference between Christianity and
Paganism is that Brahma, Ormuzd, Osiris, Zeus, Jupiter, etc., are called
by another name; Crishna, Buddha, Bacchus, Adonis, Mithras, etc., have
been turned into Christ Jesus: Venus' pigeon into the Holy Ghost; Diana,
Isis, Devaki, etc., into the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>Virgin Mary; and the demi-gods and heroes
into saints. The exploits of the one were represented as the miracles of
the other. Pagan festivals became Christian holidays, and Pagan temples
became Christian churches.</p>

<p>Mr. Mahaffy, Fellow and Tutor in Trinity College, and Lecturer on
Ancient History in the University of Dublin, ends his "Prolegomena to
Ancient History" in the following manner:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is indeed, hardly a great or fruitful idea in the
Jewish or Christian systems, which has not its analogy in the
(ancient) Egyptian faith. The development of the one God into
a <i>trinity</i>; the incarnation of the mediating deity in a
Virgin, and without a father; his conflict and his momentary
defeat by the powers of darkness; his partial victory (for the
enemy is not destroyed); his resurrection and reign over an
eternal kingdom with his justified saints; his distinction
from, and yet identity with, the uncreate incomprehensible
Father, whose form is unknown, and who dwelleth not in temples
made with hands&mdash;<i>all these theological conceptions pervade
the oldest religion of Egypt</i>. So, too, the contrast and even
the apparent inconsistencies between our moral and theological
beliefs&mdash;the vacillating attribution of sin and guilt partly
to moral weakness, partly to the interference of evil spirits,
and likewise of righteousness to moral worth, and again to the
help of good genii or angels; the immortality of the soul and
its final judgment&mdash;<i>all these things have met us in the
Egyptian ritual and moral treatises</i>. So, too, the purely
human side of morals, and the catalogue of virtues and vices,
are by natural consequences as like as are the theological
systems. <i>But I recoil from opening this great subject now; it
is enough to have lifted the veil and shown the scene of many
a future contest.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_414:1_2228" id="FNanchor_414:1_2228"></a><a href="#Footnote_414:1_2228" class="fnanchor">[414:1]</a></p></div>

<p>In regard to the <i>moral sentiments</i> expressed in the books of the New
Testament, and believed by the majority of Christians to be peculiar to
Christianity, we shall touch them but lightly, as this has already been
done so frequently by many able scholars.</p>

<p>The moral doctrines that appear in the New Testament, even the sayings
of the Sermon on the Mount and the Lord's Prayer, are found with slight
variation, among the Rabbins, who have certainly borrowed nothing out of
the New Testament.</p>

<p>Christian teachers have delighted to exhibit the essential superiority
of Christianity to Judaism, have quoted with triumph the maxims that are
said to have fallen from the lips of Jesus, and which, they surmised,
could not be paralleled in the elder Scriptures, and have put the least
favorable construction on such passages in the ancient books as seemed
to contain the thoughts of evangelists and apostles. A more ingenious
study of the Hebrew law, according to the oldest traditions, as well as
its later interpretations by the prophets, reduces these differences
materially by bringing into relief sentiments and precepts whereof the
New Testament morality is but an echo.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p><p>There are passages in Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, even tenderer in
their humanity than anything in the Gospels. The preacher from the
Mount, the prophet of the Beatitudes, does but repeat with persuasive
lips what the law-givers of his race proclaimed in mighty tones of
command. Such an acquaintance with the later literature of the Jews as
is really obtained now from popular sources, will convince the
ordinarily fair mind that the originality of the New Testament has been
greatly over-estimated.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the
naked, bury the dead, loyally serve the king, forms the first
duty of a pious man and faithful subject,"</p></div>

<p>is an abstract from the Egyptian "Book of the Dead," the oldest Bible in
the world.</p>

<p>Confucius, the Chinese philosopher, born 551 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Obey Heaven, and follow the orders of Him who governs it.
<i>Love your neighbor as yourself.</i> Do to another what you would
he should do unto you; and do not unto another what you would
should not be done unto you; thou only needest this law alone,
it is the foundation and principle of all the rest.
Acknowledge thy benefits by the return of other benefits, <i>but
never revenge injuries</i>."<a name="FNanchor_415:1_2229" id="FNanchor_415:1_2229"></a><a href="#Footnote_415:1_2229" class="fnanchor">[415:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The following extracts from Manu and the <i>Maha-bharata</i>, an Indian epic
poem, written many centuries before the time of Christ Jesus,<a name="FNanchor_415:2_2230" id="FNanchor_415:2_2230"></a><a href="#Footnote_415:2_2230" class="fnanchor">[415:2]</a>

his native ugliness. This statue sits as St. Peter, under the cupola of
the church of St. Peter. It is looked upon with the most profound

<h3>WHY CHRISTIANITY PROSPERED.</h3>

<p>We now come to the question, Why did Christianity prosper, and why was
Jesus of Nazareth believed to be a divine incarnation and Saviour?</p>

<p>There were many causes for this, but as we can devote but one chapter to
the subject, we must necessarily treat it briefly.</p>

<p>For many centuries before the time of Christ Jesus there lived a sect of
religious monks known as <i>Essenes</i>, or <i>Therapeut&aelig;</i>;<a name="FNanchor_419:1_2231" id="FNanchor_419:1_2231"></a><a href="#Footnote_419:1_2231" class="fnanchor">[419:1]</a> <i>these
entirely disappeared from history shortly after the time assigned for
the crucifixion of Jesus</i>. There were thousands of them, and their
<i>monasteries</i> were to be counted by the score. Many have asked the
question, "What became of them?" We now propose to show, 1. That they
were expecting the advent of an <i>Angel-Messiah</i>; 2. That they considered
Jesus of Nazareth to be <i>the</i> Messiah; 3. That they came over to
Christianity in a body; and, 4. That they brought the legendary
histories of the former Angel-Messiahs with them.</p>

<p>The origin of the sect known as <i>Essenes</i> is enveloped in mist, and will
probably never be revealed. To speak of all the different ideas
entertained as to their origin would make a volume of itself, we can
therefore but glance at the subject. It has been the object of Christian
writers up to a comparatively recent date, to claim that almost
everything originated with God's chosen people, the <i>Jews</i>, and that
even all languages can be traced to the <i>Hebrew</i>. Under these
circumstances, then, it is not to be wondered at that we find they have
also traced the Essenes to Hebrew origin.</p>

<p>Theophilus Gale, who wrote a work called "The Court of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>Gentiles"
(Oxford, 1671), to demonstrate that "the origin of <i>all human
literature</i>, both philology and philosophy, is from the Scriptures and
the Jewish church," undoubtedly hits upon the truth when he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Now, the origination or rise of these Essenes (among the
Jews) I conceive by the best conjectures I can make from
antiquity, <i>to be in or immediately after the Babylonian
captivity</i>, though some make them later."</p></div>

<p>Some Christian writers trace them to Moses or some of the prophets, but
that they originated in <i>India</i>, and were a sort of Buddhist sect, we
believe is their true history.</p>

<p>Gfr&ouml;rer, who wrote concerning them in 1835, and said that "<i>the Essenes
and the Therapeut&aelig; are the same sect, and hold the same views</i>," was
undoubtedly another writer who was touching upon historical ground.</p>

<p>The identity of many of the precepts and practices of <i>Essenism</i> and
those of the <i>New Testament</i> is unquestionable. Essenism urged on its
disciples to seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.<a name="FNanchor_420:1_2232" id="FNanchor_420:1_2232"></a><a href="#Footnote_420:1_2232" class="fnanchor">[420:1]</a>
The Essenes forbade the laying up of treasures upon earth.<a name="FNanchor_420:2_2233" id="FNanchor_420:2_2233"></a><a href="#Footnote_420:2_2233" class="fnanchor">[420:2]</a> The
Essenes demanded of those who wished to join them to sell all their
possessions, and to divide it among the poor brethren.<a name="FNanchor_420:3_2234" id="FNanchor_420:3_2234"></a><a href="#Footnote_420:3_2234" class="fnanchor">[420:3]</a> The
Essenes had all things in common, and appointed one of the brethren as
steward to manage the common bag.<a name="FNanchor_420:4_2235" id="FNanchor_420:4_2235"></a><a href="#Footnote_420:4_2235" class="fnanchor">[420:4]</a> Essenism put all its members on
the same level, forbidding the exercise of authority of one over the
other, and enjoining mutual service.<a name="FNanchor_420:5_2236" id="FNanchor_420:5_2236"></a><a href="#Footnote_420:5_2236" class="fnanchor">[420:5]</a> Essenism commanded its
disciples to call no man master upon the earth.<a name="FNanchor_420:6_2237" id="FNanchor_420:6_2237"></a><a href="#Footnote_420:6_2237" class="fnanchor">[420:6]</a> Essenism laid the
greatest stress upon being meek and lowly in spirit.<a name="FNanchor_420:7_2238" id="FNanchor_420:7_2238"></a><a href="#Footnote_420:7_2238" class="fnanchor">[420:7]</a> The Essenes
commended the poor in spirit, those who hunger and thirst after
righteousness, the merciful, the pure in heart, and the peacemaker. They
combined the healing of the body with that of the soul. They declared
that the power to cast out evil spirits, to perform miraculous cures,
&amp;c., should be possessed by their disciples as signs of their
belief.<a name="FNanchor_420:8_2239" id="FNanchor_420:8_2239"></a><a href="#Footnote_420:8_2239" class="fnanchor">[420:8]</a> The Essenes did not swear at all; their answer was yea,
yea, and nay, nay.<a name="FNanchor_420:9_2240" id="FNanchor_420:9_2240"></a><a href="#Footnote_420:9_2240" class="fnanchor">[420:9]</a> When the Essenes started on a mission of
mercy, they provided neither gold nor silver, neither two coats, neither
shoes, but relied on hospitality for support.<a name="FNanchor_420:10_2241" id="FNanchor_420:10_2241"></a><a href="#Footnote_420:10_2241" class="fnanchor">[420:10]</a> The Essenes,
though repudiating offensive war, yet took weapons with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>them when they
went on a perilous journey.<a name="FNanchor_421:1_2242" id="FNanchor_421:1_2242"></a><a href="#Footnote_421:1_2242" class="fnanchor">[421:1]</a> The Essenes abstained from connubial
intercourse.<a name="FNanchor_421:2_2243" id="FNanchor_421:2_2243"></a><a href="#Footnote_421:2_2243" class="fnanchor">[421:2]</a> The Essenes did not offer animal sacrifices, but
strove to present their bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable
unto God, which they regarded as a reasonable service.<a name="FNanchor_421:3_2244" id="FNanchor_421:3_2244"></a><a href="#Footnote_421:3_2244" class="fnanchor">[421:3]</a> It was the
great aim of the Essenes to live such a life of purity and holiness as
to be the temples of the Holy Spirit, and to be able to prophesy.<a name="FNanchor_421:4_2245" id="FNanchor_421:4_2245"></a><a href="#Footnote_421:4_2245" class="fnanchor">[421:4]</a></p>

<p>Many other comparisons might be made, but these are sufficient to show
that there is a great similarity between the two.<a name="FNanchor_421:5_2246" id="FNanchor_421:5_2246"></a><a href="#Footnote_421:5_2246" class="fnanchor">[421:5]</a> These
similarities have led many Christian writers to believe that Jesus
belonged to this order. Dr. Ginsburg, an advocate of this theory, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It will hardly be doubted that <i>our</i> Saviour himself belonged
to this holy brotherhood. This will especially be apparent
when we remember that the whole Jewish community, at the
advent of Christ, was divided into three parties, the
Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Essenes, and that every Jew
had to belong to one of these sects. Jesus, who, in all
things, conformed to the Jewish law, and who was holy,
harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners, would
therefore naturally associate himself with that order of
Judaism which was most congenial to his holy nature. Moreover,
the fact that Christ, with the exception of once, was not
heard of in public until his thirtieth year, implying that he
lived in seclusion with this fraternity, and that though he
frequently rebuked the scribes, Pharisees and Sadducees, he
never denounced the Essenes, strongly confirms this
conclusion."<a name="FNanchor_421:6_2247" id="FNanchor_421:6_2247"></a><a href="#Footnote_421:6_2247" class="fnanchor">[421:6]</a></p></div>

<p>The <i>facts</i>&mdash;as Dr. Ginsburg calls them&mdash;which confirm his conclusions,
are simply <i>no facts at all</i>. Jesus may or may not have been a member of
this order; but when it is stated as a fact that he never rebuked the
Essenes, it is implying too much. We know not whether the words <i>said to
have been</i> uttered by Jesus were ever uttered by him or not, and it is
almost certain that <i>had he</i> rebuked the Essenes, and had his words been
written in the Gospels, <i>they would not remain there long</i>. We hear very
little of the Essenes after <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 40,<a name="FNanchor_421:7_2248" id="FNanchor_421:7_2248"></a><a href="#Footnote_421:7_2248" class="fnanchor">[421:7]</a> therefore, when we read of
the "<i>primitive Christians</i>," we are reading of <i>Essenes</i>, and others.</p>

<p>The statement that, with the exception of once, Jesus was not heard in
public life till his <i>thirtieth</i> year, is also uncertain. One of the
early Christian Fathers (Iren&aelig;us) tells us that he did not begin <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>to
teach until he was <i>forty</i> years of age, or thereabout, and that he
lived to be nearly <i>fifty</i> years old.<a name="FNanchor_422:1_2249" id="FNanchor_422:1_2249"></a><a href="#Footnote_422:1_2249" class="fnanchor">[422:1]</a> "<i>The records of his life
are very scanty; and these have been so shaped and colored and modified
by the hands of ignorance and superstition and party prejudice and
ecclesiastical purpose, that it is hard to be sure of the original
outlines.</i>"</p>

<p>The similarity of the sentiments of the Essenes, or Therapeut&aelig;, to those
of the Church of Rome, induced the learned Jesuit, Nicolaus Serarius, to
seek for them an honorable origin. He contended therefore, that they
were Asideans, and derived them from the Rechabites, described so
circumstantially in the thirty-fifth chapter of Jeremiah; at the same
time, he asserted that the first Christian monks were Essenes.<a name="FNanchor_422:2_2250" id="FNanchor_422:2_2250"></a><a href="#Footnote_422:2_2250" class="fnanchor">[422:2]</a></p>

<p>Mr. King, speaking of the <i>Christian</i> sect called Gnostics, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Their chief doctrines had been held for centuries before
(their time) in many of the cities of Asia Minor. There, it is
probable, they first came into existence as 'Myst&aelig;,' <i>upon the
establishment of a direct intercourse with India under the
Seleucid&aelig; and the Ptolemies</i>. The colleges of <i>Essenes</i> and
Megabyzae at Ephesus, the Orphics of Thrace, the Curetes of
Crete, <i>are all merely branches of one antique and common
religion, and that originally Asiatic</i>."<a name="FNanchor_422:3_2251" id="FNanchor_422:3_2251"></a><a href="#Footnote_422:3_2251" class="fnanchor">[422:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The introduction of <i>Buddhism</i> into Egypt and Palestine
<i>affords the only true solution of innumerable difficulties in
the history of religion</i>."<a name="FNanchor_422:4_2252" id="FNanchor_422:4_2252"></a><a href="#Footnote_422:4_2252" class="fnanchor">[422:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That Buddhism had actually been planted in the dominions of
the Seleucid&aelig; and Ptolemies (Palestine belonging to the
former) before the beginning of the third century <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, is

<p>Eusebius, in quoting from Philo concerning the Essenes, seems to take it
for granted that <i>they and the Christians were one and the same</i>, and
from the manner in which he writes, it would appear that it was
generally understood so. He says that Philo called them "Worshipers,"
and concludes by saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"But whether he himself gave them this name, or whether at the
<i>beginning</i> they were so called, <i>when as yet the name of
Christians was not everywhere published</i>, I think it not
needful curiosity to sift out."<a name="FNanchor_422:6_2254" id="FNanchor_422:6_2254"></a><a href="#Footnote_422:6_2254" class="fnanchor">[422:6]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span></p><p>This celebrated ecclesiastical historian considered it very probable
that the writings of the Essenic Therapeuts in Egypt had been
incorporated into the gospels of the New Testament, and into some
Pauline epistles. His words are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is very likely that the commentaries (Scriptures) which
were among them (the Essenes) were the Gospels, and the works
of the apostles, and certain expositions of the ancient
prophets, such as partly that epistle unto the Hebrews, and
also the other epistles of Paul do contain."<a name="FNanchor_423:1_2255" id="FNanchor_423:1_2255"></a><a href="#Footnote_423:1_2255" class="fnanchor">[423:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The principal doctrines and rites of the Essenes can be connected with
the <i>East</i>, with Parsism, and especially with <i>Buddhism</i>. Among the
doctrines which Essenes and Buddhists had in common was that of the
<i>Angel-Messiah</i>.<a name="FNanchor_423:2_2256" id="FNanchor_423:2_2256"></a><a href="#Footnote_423:2_2256" class="fnanchor">[423:2]</a></p>

<p>Godfrey Higgins says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>Essenes</i> were called physicians of the soul, or
<i>Therapeut&aelig;</i>; being resident both in Judea and Egypt, they
probably spoke or had their sacred books in Chaldee. They were
<i>Pythagoreans</i>, as is proved by all their forms, ceremonies,
and doctrines, and they called themselves sons of Jesse. If
the Pythagoreans or Conobit&aelig;, as they are called by Jamblicus,
were Buddhists, the Essenes were Buddhists. The Essenes lived
in Egypt, on the lake of Parembole or Maria, in <i>monasteries</i>.
These are the very places in which we formerly found the
<i>Gymnosophists</i>, or <i>Samaneans</i>, or <i>Buddhist</i> priests to have
lived; which Gymnosophist&aelig; are placed also by Ptolemy in
north-eastern India."</p>

<p>"Their (the Essenes) parishes, churches, bishops, priests,
deacons, festivals are all identically the same (as the
Christians). They had apostolic founders; the manners which
distinguished the immediate apostles of Christ; scriptures
divinely inspired; the same allegorical mode of interpreting
them, which has since obtained among Christians, and the same
order of performing public worship. They had missionary
stations or colonies of their community established in Rome,
Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, Phillippi, Colosse, and
Thessalonica, precisely such, and in the same circumstances,
as were those to whom St. Paul addressed his letters in those
places. All the fine moral doctrines which are attributed to
the Samaritan Nazarite, and I doubt not justly attributed to
him, are to be found among the doctrines of these
ascetics."<a name="FNanchor_423:3_2257" id="FNanchor_423:3_2257"></a><a href="#Footnote_423:3_2257" class="fnanchor">[423:3]</a></p></div>

<p>And Arthur Lillie says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is asserted by calm thinkers like Dean Mansel that within
two generations of the time of Alexander the Great, the
missionaries of Buddha made their appearance at
<i>Alexandria</i>.<a name="FNanchor_423:4_2258" id="FNanchor_423:4_2258"></a><a href="#Footnote_423:4_2258" class="fnanchor">[423:4]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>This theory is confirmed&mdash;in the east by
the Asoka monuments&mdash;in the west by Philo. He expressly
maintains the identity in creed of the higher Judaism and that
of the <i>Gymnosophists</i> of India who abstained from the
'sacrifice of living animals'&mdash;in a word, the <span class="smcap">Buddhists</span>. It
would follow from this that the priestly religion of
Babylonia, Palestine, Egypt, and Greece were undermined by
certain kindred mystical societies organized by Buddha's
missionaries under the various names of Therapeutes, Essenes,
Neo-Pythagoreans, Neo-Zoroastrians, &amp;c. <i>Thus Buddhism
prepared the way for Christianity.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_424:1_2259" id="FNanchor_424:1_2259"></a><a href="#Footnote_424:1_2259" class="fnanchor">[424:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The Buddhists have the "eight-fold holy path" (Dhammapada), eight
spiritual states leading up to Buddhahood. The first state of the
Essenes resulted from baptism, and it seems to correspond with the first
Buddhistic state, those who have entered the (mystic) stream. Patience,
purity, and the mastery of passion were aimed at by both devotees in the
other stages. In the last, magical powers, healing the sick, casting out
evil spirits, etc., were supposed to be gained. Buddhists and Essenes
seem to have doubled up this eight-fold path into four, for some reason
or other. Buddhists and Essenes had three orders of ascetics or monks,
but this classification is distinct from the spiritual
classifications.<a name="FNanchor_424:2_2260" id="FNanchor_424:2_2260"></a><a href="#Footnote_424:2_2260" class="fnanchor">[424:2]</a></p>

<p>The doctrine of the "<i>Anointed Angel</i>," of the man from heaven, the
Creator of the world, the doctrine of the atoning sacrificial death of
Jesus by the blood of his cross, the doctrine of the Messianic antetype
of the Paschal lamb of the Paschal omer, and thus of the resurrection of
Christ Jesus, the third day, according to the Scriptures, these
doctrines of Paul can, with more or less certainty, be connected with
the Essenes. It becomes almost a certainty that Eusebius was right in
surmising that <i>Essenic writings have been used by Paul and the
evangelists</i>. Not Jesus, but Paul, is the cause of the separation of the
Jews from the Christians.<a name="FNanchor_424:3_2261" id="FNanchor_424:3_2261"></a><a href="#Footnote_424:3_2261" class="fnanchor">[424:3]</a></p>

<p>The probability, then, that that sect of vagrant quack-doctors, the
Therapeut&aelig;, who were established in Egypt and its neighborhood many ages
before the period assigned by later theologians as that of the birth of
Christ Jesus, were the original fabricators of the writings contained in
the New Testament, becomes a certainty on the basis of evidence, than
which history has nothing more certain, furnished by the unguarded, but
explicit, unwary, but most unqualified and positive statement of the
historian Eusebius, that "<i>those ancient Therapeut&aelig; were Christians, and
that their ancient writings were our gospels and epistles</i>."</p>

<p>The Essenes, the Therapeuts, the Ascetics, the Monks, the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>Ecclesiastics,
and the Eclectics, are but different names for one and the self-same
sect.</p>

<p>The word "<i>Essene</i>" is nothing more than the Egyptian word for that of
which Therapeut is the Greek, each of them signifying "healer" or
"doctor," and designating the character of the sect as professing to be
endued with the miraculous gift of healing; and more especially so with
respect to diseases of the mind.</p>

<p>Their name of "<i>Ascetics</i>" indicated the severe discipline and exercise
of self-mortification, long fastings, prayers, contemplation, and even
making of themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake, as did
Origen, Melito, and others who derived their Christianity from the same
school; Jesus himself is represented to have recognized and approved
their practice.</p>

<p>Their name of "<i>Monks</i>" indicated their delight in solitude, their
contemplative life, and their entire segregation and abstraction from
the world, which Jesus, in the Gospel, is in like manner represented as
describing, as characteristic of the community of which he was a member.</p>

<p>Their name of "<i>Ecclesiastics</i>" was of the same sense, and indicated
their being called out, elected, separated from the general fraternity
of mankind, and set apart to the more immediate service and honor of
God.</p>

<p>They had a flourishing university, or corporate body, established upon
these principles, at Alexandria in Egypt, long before the period
assigned for the birth of Christ Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_425:1_2262" id="FNanchor_425:1_2262"></a><a href="#Footnote_425:1_2262" class="fnanchor">[425:1]</a></p>

<p>From this body they sent out missionaries, and had established colonies,
auxiliary branches, and affiliated communities, in various cities of
Asia Minor, which colonies were in a flourishing condition, before the
preaching of St. Paul.</p>

<p>"<i>The very ancient and Eastern doctrine of an Angel-Messiah had been
applied to Gautama-Buddha, and so it was applied to Jesus Christ by the
Essenes of Egypt and of Palestine, who introduced this new Messianic
doctrine into Essenic Judaism and Essenic Christianity.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_425:2_2263" id="FNanchor_425:2_2263"></a><a href="#Footnote_425:2_2263" class="fnanchor">[425:2]</a></p>

<p>In the Pali and Sanscrit texts the word <i>Buddha</i> is always used as a
<i>title</i>, not as a name. It means "The Enlightened One." Gautama Buddha
is represented to have taught that he was only one of a long series of
Buddhas, who appear at intervals in the world, and who all teach the
same system. After the death of each Buddha his religion flourishes for
a time, but finally wickedness and vice <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>again rule over the land. Then
a <i>new</i> Buddha appears, who again preaches the lost <i>Dharma</i> or truth.
The names of twenty-four of these Buddhas who appeared previous to
Gautama have been handed down to us. The <i>Buddhavansa</i>, or "History of
the Buddhas," the last book of the <i>Khuddaka Nikaya</i> in the second
Pitca, gives the lives of all the previous Buddhas before commencing its
account of Gautama himself; and the Pali commentary on the <i>Jatakas</i>
gives certain details regarding each of the twenty-four.<a name="FNanchor_426:1_2264" id="FNanchor_426:1_2264"></a><a href="#Footnote_426:1_2264" class="fnanchor">[426:1]</a></p>

<p>An <i>Avatar</i> was expected about every six hundred years.<a name="FNanchor_426:2_2265" id="FNanchor_426:2_2265"></a><a href="#Footnote_426:2_2265" class="fnanchor">[426:2]</a> At the
time of Jesus of Nazareth an Avatar was expected, not by some of the
Jews alone, but by most every eastern nation.<a name="FNanchor_426:3_2266" id="FNanchor_426:3_2266"></a><a href="#Footnote_426:3_2266" class="fnanchor">[426:3]</a> Many persons were
thought at that time to be, and undoubtedly thought themselves to be,
<i>the</i> Christ, and the only reason why the name of Jesus of Nazareth
succeeded above all others, is because the <i>Essenes</i>&mdash;who were expecting
an Angel-Messiah&mdash;espoused it. Had it not been for this almost
indisputable fact, the name of Jesus of Nazareth would undoubtedly not
be known at the present day.</p>

<p>Epiphanius, a Christian bishop and writer of the fourth century, says,
in speaking of the Essenes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They who believed on Christ were called <span class="smcap">Jess&aelig;i</span> (or Essenes),
<i>before they were called Christians</i>. These derived their
constitution from the signification of the name Jesus, which
in Hebrew signifies the same as <i>Therapeutes</i>, that is, a
saviour or physician."</p></div>

<p>Thus we see that, according to Christian authority, the Essenes and
Therapeutes are one, and that the Essenes espoused the cause of Jesus of
Nazareth, accepted him as an Angel-Messiah, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>became known to history
as <i>Christians</i>, or believers in the Anointed Angel.</p>

<p>This ascetic <i>Buddhist</i> sect called Essenes were therefore expecting an
Angel-Messiah, for had not Gautama announced to his disciples that
another Buddha, and therefore another angel in human form, another organ
or advocate of the wisdom from above, would descend from heaven to
earth, and would be called the "Son of Love."</p>

<p>The learned Thomas Maurice says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"From the earliest post-diluvian age, to that in which the
Messiah appeared, together with the traditions which so
expressly recorded the fall of the human race from a state of
original rectitude and felicity, there appears, from an
infinite variety of hieroglyphic monuments and of written
documents, to have prevailed, from generation to generation,
<i>throughout all the regions of the higher Asia</i>, an uniform
belief that, in the course of revolving ages, <i>there should
arise a sacred personage, a mighty deliverer of mankind from
the thraldom of sin and of death</i>. In fact, the memory of the
grand original promise, that the seed of the woman should
eventually crush the serpent, was carefully preserved in the
breasts of the <i>Asiatics</i>; it entered deeply into their
symbolic superstitions, and was engraved aloft amidst their
mythologic sculptures."<a name="FNanchor_427:1_2267" id="FNanchor_427:1_2267"></a><a href="#Footnote_427:1_2267" class="fnanchor">[427:1]</a></p></div>

<p>That an Angel-Messiah was generally expected at this time may be
inferred from the following facts: Some of the Gnostic sects of
Christians, who believed that Jesus was an emanation from God, likewise
supposed that there were several <i>&AElig;ons</i>, or emanations from the Eternal
Father. Among those who taught this doctrine was <i>Basilides</i> and his
followers.<a name="FNanchor_427:2_2268" id="FNanchor_427:2_2268"></a><a href="#Footnote_427:2_2268" class="fnanchor">[427:2]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon Magus</span> was believed to be "He who should come." Simon was worshiped
in Samaria and other countries, as the expected Angel-Messiah, as a God.</p>

<p>Justin Martyr says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"After the ascension of our Lord into heaven, certain <i>men</i>
were suborned by demons as their agents, who said that they
were gods (<i>i. e.</i>, <i>the</i> Angel Messiah). Among these was
<i>Simon</i>, a certain Samaritan, whom nearly all the Samaritans
and a few also of other nations, worshiped, confessing him as
a Supreme God."<a name="FNanchor_427:3_2269" id="FNanchor_427:3_2269"></a><a href="#Footnote_427:3_2269" class="fnanchor">[427:3]</a></p></div>

<p>His miracles were notorious, and admitted by all. His followers became
so numerous that they were to be found in all countries. In Rome, in the
reign of Claudius, a statue was erected in his honor. Clement of Rome,
speaking of Simon Magus, says that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He wishes to be considered an exalted person, and to be
considered 'the Christ.' He claims that he can never be
dissolved, asserting that he will endure to eternity."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span></p><p>Montanus was another person who evidently believed himself to be an
Angel-Messiah. He was called by himself and his followers the
"Paraclete," or "Holy Spirit."<a name="FNanchor_428:1_2270" id="FNanchor_428:1_2270"></a><a href="#Footnote_428:1_2270" class="fnanchor">[428:1]</a></p>

<p>Socrates, in his Ecclesiastical History, tells us of one <i>Buddhas</i> (who
lived after Jesus):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Who afore that time was called Terebynthus, which went to the
coasts of Babylon, inhabited by Persians, and there published
of himself many false wonders: that he was born of a virgin,
that he was bred and brought up in the mountains, etc."<a name="FNanchor_428:2_2271" id="FNanchor_428:2_2271"></a><a href="#Footnote_428:2_2271" class="fnanchor">[428:2]</a></p></div>

<p>He was evidently one of the many fanatics who believed themselves to be
the Paraclete or Comforter, the "Expected One."</p>

<p>Another one of these <i>Christs</i> was <i>Apollonius</i>. This remarkable man was
born a few years before the commencement of the Christian era, and
during his career, sustained the role of a philosopher, religious
teacher and reformer, and a worker of miracles. He is said to have lived
to be a hundred years old. From the history of his life, written by the
learned sophist and scholar, Philostratus, we glean the following:</p>

<p>Before his birth a god appeared to his mother and informed her that he
himself should be born of her. At the time of her delivery, the most
wonderful things happened. All the people of the country acknowledged
that he was the "Son of God." As he grew in stature, his wonderful
powers, greatness of memory, and marvelous beauty attracted the
attention of all. A great part of his time was spent, when a youth,
among the learned doctors; the disciples of Plato, Chrysippus and
Aristotle. When he came to man's estate, he became an enthusiastic
admirer and devoted follower of Pythagoras. His fame soon spread far and
near, and wherever he went he reformed the religious worship of the day.
He went to Ephesus, like Christ Jesus to Jerusalem, where the people
flocked about him. While at Athens, in Greece, he cast out an evil
spirit from a youth. As soon as Apollonius fixed his eyes upon him, the
demon broke out into the most angry and horrid expressions, and then
swore he would depart out of the youth. He put an end to a plague which
was raging at Ephesus, and at Corinth he raised a dead maiden to life,
by simply taking her by the hand and bidding her arise. The miracles of
Apollonius were extensively believed, <i>by Christians as well as others</i>,
for centuries after his time. In the fourth century Hierocles drew a
parallel between the two Christs&mdash;Apollonius and Jesus&mdash;which was
answered by Eusebius, the great champion <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>of the Christian church. In it
he admits the miracles of Apollonius, but attributes them to sorcery.</p>

<p>Apollonius was worshiped as a god, in different countries, as late as
the fourth century. A beautiful temple was built in honor of him, and he
was held in high esteem by many of the Pagan emperors. Eunapius, who
wrote concerning him in the fifth century, says that his history should
have been entitled "<i>The Descent of a God</i> upon Earth." It is as Albert
Reville says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The universal respect in which Apollonius was held by the
whole pagan world, testified to the deep impression which the
life of this <i>Supernatural Being</i> had left indelibly fixed in
their minds; an expression which caused one of his
contemporaries to exclaim, '<i>We have a God living among us.</i>'"</p></div>

<p>A Samaritan, by name Menander, who was contemporary with the apostles of
Jesus, was another of these fanatics who believed himself to be the
Christ. He went about performing miracles, claiming that he was a
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span>, "sent down from above from the invisible worlds, <i>for the
salvation of mankind</i>."<a name="FNanchor_429:1_2272" id="FNanchor_429:1_2272"></a><a href="#Footnote_429:1_2272" class="fnanchor">[429:1]</a> He baptized his followers in his own
name. His influence was great, and continued for several centuries.
Justin Martyr and other Christian Fathers wrote against him.</p>

<p>Manes evidently believed himself to be "the Christ," or "he who was to
come." His followers also believed the same concerning him. Eusebius,
speaking of him, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He presumed to represent the person of Christ; he proclaimed
himself to be the Comforter and the Holy Ghost, and being
puffed up with this frantic pride, chose, as if he were
Christ, <i>twelve</i> partners of his new-found doctrine, patching
into one heap false and detestable doctrines of old, rotten,
and rooted out heresies, <i>the which he brought out of
Persia</i>."<a name="FNanchor_429:2_2273" id="FNanchor_429:2_2273"></a><a href="#Footnote_429:2_2273" class="fnanchor">[429:2]</a></p></div>

<p>The word Manes, says Usher in his Annals, has the meaning of Paraclete
or Comforter or Saviour. This at once lets us into the secret&mdash;a new
incarnation, an Angel-Messiah, a Christ&mdash;born from the side of his
mother, and put to a violent death&mdash;flayed alive, and hung up, or
crucified, by a king of Persia.<a name="FNanchor_429:3_2274" id="FNanchor_429:3_2274"></a><a href="#Footnote_429:3_2274" class="fnanchor">[429:3]</a> This is the teacher with his
twelve apostles on the rock of Gualior.</p>

<p>Du Perron, in his life of Zoroaster, gives an account of certain
prophecies to be found in the sacred books of the <i>Persians</i>. One of
these is to the effect that, at successive periods of time, there will
appear on earth certain "Sons of Zoroaster," who are to be the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>result
of <i>immaculate conceptions</i>. These virgin-born gods will come upon earth
for the purpose of establishing the law of God. It is also asserted that
Zoroaster, when on earth, declared that in the "latter days" a pure
virgin would conceive, and bear a son, and that as soon as the child was
born a <i>star</i> would appear, blazing even at noonday, with undiminished
splendor. This Christ is to be called <i>Sosiosh</i>. He will redeem mankind,
and subdue the Devs, who have been tempting and leading men astray ever
since the fall of our first parents.</p>

<p>Among the Greeks the same prophecy was found. The Oracle of Delphi was
the depository, according to Plato, of an ancient and <i>secret</i> prophecy
of the birth of a "Son of Apollo," who was to restore the reign of
justice and virtue on the earth.<a name="FNanchor_430:1_2275" id="FNanchor_430:1_2275"></a><a href="#Footnote_430:1_2275" class="fnanchor">[430:1]</a></p>

<p>Those who believed in successive emanations of &AElig;ons from the Throne of
Light, pointed to the passage in the Gospels where Jesus is made to say
that he will be succeeded by the Paraclete or Comforter. Mahommed was
believed by many to be this Paraclete, and it is said that he too told
his disciples that <i>another</i> Paraclete would succeed him. From present
appearances, however, there is some reason for believing that the
Mohammedans are to have their ancient prophecy set at naught by the
multiplicity of those who pretend to be divinely appointed to fulfill
it. The present year was designated as the period at which this great
reformer was to arise, who should be almost, if not quite, the equal of
Mahommed. His mission was to be to to purify the religion from its
corruptions; to overthrow those who had usurped its control, and to
rule, as a great spiritual caliph, over the faithful. According to
accepted tradition, the prophet himself designated the line of descent
in which his most important successor would be found, and even indicated
his personal appearance. The time having arrived, it is not strange that
the man is forthcoming, only in this instance there is more than one
claimant. There is a "holy man" in Morocco who has allowed it to be
announced that he is the designated reformer, while cable reports show
that a rival pretender has appeared in Yemen, in southern Arabia, and
his supporters, sword in hand, are now advancing upon Mecca, for the
purpose of proclaiming their leader as caliph within the sacred city
itself.</p>

<p>History then relates to us the indisputable fact that at the time of
Jesus of Nazareth an Angel-Messiah was expected, that many persons
claimed, and were believed to be, <i>the</i> "Expected One," and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>that the
reason why <i>Jesus</i> was accepted above all others was because the
Essenes&mdash;a very numerous sect&mdash;believed him to be the true Messiah, and
came over to his followers in a body. It was because there were so many
of these <i>Christs</i> in existence that some follower of Jesus&mdash;but no one
knows <i>who</i>&mdash;wrote as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If any man shall say to you, Lo, <i>here is Christ</i>, or, lo, he
is <i>there</i>; believe him not; for <i>false Christs</i> and false
prophets shall rise, <i>and shall show signs and wonders</i> to
seduce, if it were possible, even the elect."<a name="FNanchor_431:1_2276" id="FNanchor_431:1_2276"></a><a href="#Footnote_431:1_2276" class="fnanchor">[431:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The reasons why Jesus was not accepted as the Messiah by the <i>majority</i>
of the Jews was because the majority expected a daring and irresistible
warrior and conqueror, who, armed with greater power than C&aelig;sar, was to
come upon earth to rend the fetters in which their hapless nation had so
long groaned, to avenge them upon their haughty oppressors, and to
re-establish the kingdom of Judah; and this Jesus&mdash;although he evidently
claimed to be the Messiah&mdash;did not do.</p>

<p>Tacitus, the Roman historian, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The generality had a strong persuasion that it was contained
in the ancient writings of the priests, that at that very time
the east should prevail: and that some one, who should come
out of Judea, <i>should obtain the empire of the world</i>; which
ambiguities foretold Vespasian and Titus. But the common
people (of the Jews), according to the influence of human
wishes, appropriated to themselves, by their interpretation,
this vast grandeur foretold by the fates, nor could be brought
to change their opinion for the true, by all their
adversities."</p></div>

<p>Suetonius, another Roman historian, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There had been for a long time all over the east a constant
persuasion that it was recorded in the fates (books of the
fates, or foretellings), that at that time some one who should
come out of Judea <i>should obtain universal dominion</i>. It
appears by the event, that this prediction referred to the
Roman emperor; but the Jews, referring it to themselves,
rebelled."</p></div>

<p>This is corroborated by Josephus, the Jewish historian, who says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That which, chiefly excited them (the Jews) to war, was an
<i>ambiguous prophecy</i>, which was also found in the sacred
books, that at that time some one, within their country,
should arise, that should obtain <i>the empire of the whole
world</i>. For this they had received by tradition, that it was
spoken of one of their nation; and many wise men were deceived
with the interpretation. But, in truth, Vespasian's empire was
designed in this prophecy, who was created emperor (of Rome)
<i>in Judea</i>."</p></div>

<p>As the Rev. Dr. Geikie remarks, the central and dominant characteristic
of the teaching of the rabbis, was the certain advent of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>a great
national <i>Deliverer</i>&mdash;the Messiah&mdash;but not a God from heaven.</p>

<p>For a time <i>Cyrus</i> appeared to realize the promised Deliverer, or, at
least, to be the chosen instrument to prepare the way for him, and, in
his turn, <i>Zerubabel</i> became the centre of Messianic hopes. In fact, the
national mind had become so inflammable, by constant brooding on this
one theme, that any bold spirit, rising in revolt against the Roman
power, could find an army of fierce disciples who trusted that it should
be he who would redeem Israel.<a name="FNanchor_432:1_2277" id="FNanchor_432:1_2277"></a><a href="#Footnote_432:1_2277" class="fnanchor">[432:1]</a></p>

<p>The "<i>taxing</i>" which took place under Cyrenius, Governor of Syria (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span>
7), excited the wildest uproar against the Roman power. The Hebrew
spirit was stung into exasperation; the puritans of the nation, the
enthusiasts, fanatics, the zealots of the law, the literal
constructionists of prophecy, appealed to the national temper, revived
the national faith, and fanned into flame the combustible elements that
smoldered in the bosom of the race. The Messianic hope was strong in
these people; all the stronger on account of their political
degradation. Born in sorrow, the anticipation grew keen in bitter hours.
That Jehovah would abandon them could not be believed. The thought would
be atheism. The hope kept the eastern Jews in a perpetual state of
insurrection. The cry "Lo here, lo there!" was incessant. Claimant after
claimant of the dangerous supremacy of the <i>Messiah</i> appeared, pitched a
camp in the wilderness, raised the banner, gathered a force, was
attacked, defeated, banished, or crucified; but the frenzy did not
abate.</p>

<p>The last insurrection among the Jews, that of Bar-Cochba&mdash;"Son of the
Star"&mdash;revealed an astonishing frenzy of zeal. It was purely a
<i>Messianic</i> uprising. Judaism had excited the fears of the Emperor
Hadrian, and induced him to inflict unusual severities on the people.
The effect of the violence was to stimulate that conviction to fury. The
night of their despair was once more illumined by the star of the east.
The banner of the Messiah was raised. <ins class="corr" title="[original Potents]">Portents</ins>, as of old, were seen in
the sky; the clouds were watched for the glory that should appear.
<i>Bar-Cochba</i> seemed to fill out the popular idea of the deliverer.
Miracles were ascribed to him; flames issued from his mouth. The vulgar
imagination made haste to transform the audacious fanatic into a child
of David. Multitudes flocked to his standard. The whole Jewish race
throughout the world was in commotion. The insurrection gained head. The
heights about Jerusalem were seized and occupied, and fortifications
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>were erected; nothing but the "host of angels" was needed to insure
victory. The angels did not appear; the Roman legions did. The
"Messiah," not proving himself a conqueror, was held to have proved
himself an impostor, the "son of a lie."<a name="FNanchor_433:1_2278" id="FNanchor_433:1_2278"></a><a href="#Footnote_433:1_2278" class="fnanchor">[433:1]</a></p>

<p>The impetuous zeal with which the Jews rushed to the standard of this
Messianic impostor, in the 130th year of the Christian era, demonstrates
the true Jewish character, and shows how readily any one who made the
claim, was believed to be "He who should come." Even the celebrated
Rabbi Akiba sanctioned this daring fraud. Akiba declared that the
so-called prophecy of Balaam,&mdash;"<i>a star shall rise out of Jacob</i>,"&mdash;was
accomplished. Hence the impostor took his title of <i>Bar-Cochabas</i>, or
<i>Son of the Star</i>; and Akiba not only publicly anointed him "<span class="smcap">King of the
Jews</span>," and placed an imperial diadem upon his head, but followed him to
the field at the head of four-and-twenty thousand of his disciples, and
acted in the capacity of master of his horse.</p>

<p>Those who believed on the meek and benevolent Jesus&mdash;and whose number
was very small&mdash;were of that class who believed in the doctrine of the
<i>Angel-Messiah</i>,<a name="FNanchor_433:2_2279" id="FNanchor_433:2_2279"></a><a href="#Footnote_433:2_2279" class="fnanchor">[433:2]</a> first heard of among them when taken captives to
Babylon. These believed that just as Buddha appeared at different
intervals, and as Vishnu appeared at different intervals, the avatars
appeared among the Jews. Adam, and Enoch, and Noah, and Elijah or Elias,
might in outward appearance be different men, but they were really the
self-same divine person successively animating various human
bodies.<a name="FNanchor_433:3_2280" id="FNanchor_433:3_2280"></a><a href="#Footnote_433:3_2280" class="fnanchor">[433:3]</a> Christ <i>Jesus</i> was the <i>avatar</i> of the ninth age, Christ
<i>Cyrus</i> was the <i>avatar</i> of the eighth. Of the hero of the eighth age it
is said: "Thus said the Lord to his Anointed (<i>i. e.</i>, his <i>Christ</i>),
his Messiah, to Cyrus, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>whose right hand I have holden to subdue
nations."<a name="FNanchor_434:1_2281" id="FNanchor_434:1_2281"></a><a href="#Footnote_434:1_2281" class="fnanchor">[434:1]</a> The eighth period began about the Babylonish captivity,
about six hundred years before Christ <i>Jesus</i>. The ninth began with
Christ Jesus, making in all eight cycles before Jesus.</p>

<p>"What was known in Judea more than a century before the birth of Jesus
Christ cannot have been introduced among Buddhists by Christian
missionaries. It will become equally certain that the bishop and
church-historian, Eusebius, was right when he wrote, that he considered
it highly probable that the writings of the Essenic Therapeuts in Egypt
had been incorporated into our Gospels, and into some Pauline
epistles."<a name="FNanchor_434:2_2282" id="FNanchor_434:2_2282"></a><a href="#Footnote_434:2_2282" class="fnanchor">[434:2]</a></p>

<p>For further information on the subject of the connection between
Essenism and Christianity, the reader is referred to Taylor's Diegesis,
Bunsen's Angel-Messiah, and the works of S. F. Dunlap. We shall now
speak of another powerful lever which was brought to bear upon the
promulgation of Christianity; namely, that of <span class="smcap">Fraud</span>.</p>

<p>It was a common thing among the early Christian Fathers and saints to
lie and deceive, if their lies and deceits helped the cause of their
Christ. Lactantius, an eminent Christian author who flourished in the
fourth century, has well said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Among those who seek power and gain from their religion,
there will never be wanting an inclination to forge and lie
for it."<a name="FNanchor_434:3_2283" id="FNanchor_434:3_2283"></a><a href="#Footnote_434:3_2283" class="fnanchor">[434:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Gregory of Nazianzus, writing to St. Jerome, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A little jargon is all that is necessary to impose on the
people. The less they comprehend, the more they admire. Our
forefathers and doctors have often said, not what they
thought, but what circumstances and necessity
dictated."<a name="FNanchor_434:4_2284" id="FNanchor_434:4_2284"></a><a href="#Footnote_434:4_2284" class="fnanchor">[434:4]</a></p></div>

<p>The celebrated <i>Eusebius</i>, Bishop of <span class="smcap">C&aelig;sarea</span>, and friend of Constantine
the Great, who is our chief guide for the early history of the Church,
<i>confesses that he was by no means scrupulous to record the whole truth
concerning the early Christians in the various works which he has left
behind him</i>.<a name="FNanchor_434:5_2285" id="FNanchor_434:5_2285"></a><a href="#Footnote_434:5_2285" class="fnanchor">[434:5]</a> Edward Gibbon, speaking of him, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The gravest of the ecclesiastical historians, Eusebius
himself, indirectly confesses that he has related what might
redound to the glory, and that he has suppressed all that
could tend to the disgrace of religion. Such an acknowledgment
will naturally excite a suspicion that a writer who has so
openly violated one of the fundamental laws of history, has
not paid a very strict regard to the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>observance of the other;
and the suspicion will derive additional credit from the
character of Eusebius, which was less tinctured with
credulity, and more practiced in the arts of courts, than that
of almost any of his contemporaries."<a name="FNanchor_435:1_2286" id="FNanchor_435:1_2286"></a><a href="#Footnote_435:1_2286" class="fnanchor">[435:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The great theologian, Beausobre, in his "Histoire de Manichee," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We see in the history which I have related, a sort of
hypocrisy, that has been perhaps, but too common at all times;
that churchmen not only do not say what they think, but they
do say the direct contrary of what they think. Philosophers in
their cabinets; out of them they are content with fables,
though they well know they are fables. Nay, more; they deliver
honest men to the executioner, for having uttered what they
themselves know to be true. How many atheists and pagans have
burned holy men under the pretext of heresy? Every day do
hypocrites consecrate, and make people adore the host, though
as well convinced as I am, that it is nothing but a bit of
bread."<a name="FNanchor_435:2_2287" id="FNanchor_435:2_2287"></a><a href="#Footnote_435:2_2287" class="fnanchor">[435:2]</a></p></div>

<p>M. Daille says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This opinion has always been in the world, that to settle a
certain and assured estimation upon that which is good and
true, it is necessary to remove out of the way, whatsoever may
be an hinderance to it. <i>Neither ought we to wonder that even
those of the honest, innocent, primitive times made use of
these deceits, seeing for a good end they made no scruple to
forge whole books.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_435:3_2288" id="FNanchor_435:3_2288"></a><a href="#Footnote_435:3_2288" class="fnanchor">[435:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Reeves, in his "Apologies of the Fathers," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was a Catholic opinion among the philosophers, that pious
frauds were good things, and that the people ought to be
imposed on in matters of religion."<a name="FNanchor_435:4_2289" id="FNanchor_435:4_2289"></a><a href="#Footnote_435:4_2289" class="fnanchor">[435:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Mosheim, the ecclesiastical historian, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was held as a maxim that it was not only lawful but
praiseworthy to <i>deceive</i>, and even to use the expedient of a
<i>lie</i>, in order to advance the cause of truth and
piety."<a name="FNanchor_435:5_2290" id="FNanchor_435:5_2290"></a><a href="#Footnote_435:5_2290" class="fnanchor">[435:5]</a></p></div>

<p>Isaac de Casaubon, the great ecclesiastical scholar, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It mightily affects me, to see how many there were in the
earliest times of the church, who considered it as a capital
exploit, to lend to heavenly truth the help of their own
inventions, in order that the new doctrine might be more
readily allowed by the wise among the Gentiles. <i>These
officious lies, they were wont to say, were devised for a good
end.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_435:6_2291" id="FNanchor_435:6_2291"></a><a href="#Footnote_435:6_2291" class="fnanchor">[435:6]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span></p><p>The Apostolic Father, Hermas, who was the fellow-laborer of St. Paul in
the work of the ministry; who is greeted as such in the New Testament;
and whose writings are expressly quoted as of divine inspiration, by the
early Fathers, ingenuously confesses that lying was the easily-besetting
sin of a Christian. His words are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"O Lord, I never spake a true word in my life, but I have
always lived in dissimulation, and affirmed a lie for truth to
all men, and no man contradicted me, but all gave credit to my
words."</p></div>

<p>To which the holy angel, whom he addresses, condescendingly admonishes
him, that as the lie was up, now, he had better keep it up, and as in
time it would come to be believed, it would answer as well as
truth.<a name="FNanchor_436:1_2292" id="FNanchor_436:1_2292"></a><a href="#Footnote_436:1_2292" class="fnanchor">[436:1]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Mosheim admits, that the Platonists and Pythagoreans held it as a
maxim, that it was not only lawful, but praiseworthy, to deceive, and
even to use the expedient of a lie, in order to advance the cause of
truth and piety. The Jews who lived in Egypt, had learned and received
this maxim from them, before the coming of Christ Jesus, as appears
incontestably from a multitude of ancient records, <i>and the Christians
were infected from both these sources, with the same pernicious
error</i>.<a name="FNanchor_436:2_2293" id="FNanchor_436:2_2293"></a><a href="#Footnote_436:2_2293" class="fnanchor">[436:2]</a></p>

<p>Of the fifteen letters ascribed to Ignatius (Bishop of Antioch after 69
<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span>), <i>eight have been rejected by Christian writers as being
forgeries</i>, having no authority whatever. "<i>The remaining seven</i>
epistles were accounted genuine by most critics, although disputed by
some, previous to the discoveries of Mr. Cureton, <i>which have shaken,
and indeed almost wholly destroyed the credit and authenticity of all
alike</i>."<a name="FNanchor_436:3_2294" id="FNanchor_436:3_2294"></a><a href="#Footnote_436:3_2294" class="fnanchor">[436:3]</a></p>

<p>Paul of Tarsus, who was preaching a doctrine which had already been
preached to every nation on earth,<a name="FNanchor_436:4_2295" id="FNanchor_436:4_2295"></a><a href="#Footnote_436:4_2295" class="fnanchor">[436:4]</a> inculcates and avows the
principle of deceiving the common people, talks of his having been

guile,<a name="FNanchor_436:5_2296" id="FNanchor_436:5_2296"></a><a href="#Footnote_436:5_2296" class="fnanchor">[436:5]</a> and of his known and willful lies, abounding to the glory

<p>Even the orthodox Doctor Burnet, an eminent English author, in his
treatise "<i>De Statu Mortuorum</i>," purposely written in Latin, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>that it
might serve for the instruction of the clergy only, and not come to the
knowledge of the laity, because, as he said, "<i>too much light is hurtful
for weak eyes</i>," not only justified but recommended the practice of the
most consummate hypocrisy, and would have his clergy seriously preach
and maintain the reality and eternity of hell torments, even though they
should believe nothing of the sort themselves.<a name="FNanchor_437:1_2298" id="FNanchor_437:1_2298"></a><a href="#Footnote_437:1_2298" class="fnanchor">[437:1]</a></p>

<p>The incredible and very ridiculous stories related by Christian Fathers
and ecclesiastical historians, <i>on whom we are obliged to rely for
information on the most important of subjects</i>, show us how
untrustworthy these men were. We have, for instance, the story related
by St. Augustine, who is styled "the greatest of the Latin Fathers," of
his preaching the Gospel to people <i>without heads</i>. In his 33d Sermon he
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I was already Bishop of Hippo, when I went into Ethiopia with
some servants of Christ there to preach the Gospel. In this
country we saw many men and women without heads, who had two
great eyes in their breasts; and in countries still more
southly, we saw people who had but one eye in their
foreheads."<a name="FNanchor_437:2_2299" id="FNanchor_437:2_2299"></a><a href="#Footnote_437:2_2299" class="fnanchor">[437:2]</a></p></div>

<p>This same holy Father bears an equally unquestionable testimony to
several resurrections of the dead, of <i>which he himself had been an
eye-witness</i>.</p>

<p>In a book written "towards the close of the second century, by some
zealous believer," and fathered upon one Nicodemus, who is said to have
been a disciple of Christ Jesus, we find the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We all know the blessed Simeon, the high priest, who took
Jesus when an infant into his arms in the temple. This same
Simeon had two sons of his own, <i>and we were all present at
their death and funeral</i>. Go therefore and see their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>tombs,
for these are open, and they are risen; and behold, <i>they are
in the city of Arimath&aelig;a, spending their time together in
offices of devotion</i>."<a name="FNanchor_438:1_2300" id="FNanchor_438:1_2300"></a><a href="#Footnote_438:1_2300" class="fnanchor">[438:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Eusebius, "the Father of ecclesiastical history," Bishop of C&aelig;sarea, and
one of the most prominent personages at the Council of Nice, relates as
truth, the ridiculous story of King Agbarus writing a letter to Christ
Jesus, and of Jesus' answer to the same.<a name="FNanchor_438:2_2301" id="FNanchor_438:2_2301"></a><a href="#Footnote_438:2_2301" class="fnanchor">[438:2]</a> And Socrates relates how
the Empress Helen, mother of the Emperor Constantine, went to Jerusalem
for the purpose of finding, if possible, "the cross of Christ." This she
succeeded in doing, also the nails with which he was nailed to the
cross.<a name="FNanchor_438:3_2302" id="FNanchor_438:3_2302"></a><a href="#Footnote_438:3_2302" class="fnanchor">[438:3]</a></p>

<p>Beside forging, lying, and deceiving for the cause of Christ, the
Christian Fathers destroyed all evidence against themselves and their
religion, which they came across. Christian divines seem to have always
been afraid of too much light. In the very infancy of printing, Cardinal
Wolsey foresaw its effect on Christianity, and in a speech to the
clergy, publicly forewarned them, that, <i>if they did not destroy the
Press, the Press would destroy them</i>.<a name="FNanchor_438:4_2303" id="FNanchor_438:4_2303"></a><a href="#Footnote_438:4_2303" class="fnanchor">[438:4]</a> There can be no doubt, that

and other opponents of the Christian faith, been permitted to come down
to us, the plagiarism in the Christian Scriptures from previously
existing Pagan documents, is the specific charge they would have
presented us. But these were ordered to be burned, by the prudent piety
of the Christian emperors.</p>

<p>In Alexandria, in Egypt, there was an immense library, founded by the
Ptolemies. This library was situated in the Alexandrian Museum; the
apartments which were allotted for it were beautifully sculptured, and
crowded with the choicest statues and pictures; the building was built
of marble. This library eventually comprised <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>four hundred thousand
volumes. In the course of time, probably on account of inadequate
accommodation for so many books, an additional library was established,
and placed in the temple of Serapis. The number of volumes in this
library, which was called the daughter of that in the museum, was
eventually three hundred thousand. There were, therefore, <i>seven hundred
thousand volumes in these royal collections</i>.</p>

<p>In the establishment of the museum, Ptolemy Soter, and his son
Philadelphus, had three objects in view: 1. The perpetuation of such
knowledge as was then in the world; 2. Its increase; 3. Its diffusion.</p>

<p>1. <i>For the perpetuation of knowledge.</i> Orders were given to the chief
librarian to buy, at the king's expense, whatever books he could. A body
of transcribers was maintained in the museum, whose duty it was to make
correct copies of such works as their owners were not disposed to sell.
<i>Any books brought by foreigners into Egypt</i> were taken at once to the
museum, and when correct copies had been made, the transcript was given
to the owner, and the original placed in the library. Often a very large
pecuniary indemnity was paid.</p>

<p>2. <i>For the increase of knowledge.</i> One of the chief objects of the
museum was that of serving as the home of a body of men who devoted
themselves to study, and were lodged and maintained at the king's
expense. In the original organization of the museum the residents were
divided into four faculties,&mdash;Literature, Mathematics, Astronomy, and
Medicine. An officer of very great distinction presided over the
establishment, and had general charge of its interests. Demetius
Phalareus, perhaps the most learned man of his age, who had been
Governor of Athens for many years, was the first so appointed. Under him
was the librarian, an office sometimes held by men whose names have
descended to our times, as Eratosthenes and Apollonius Rhodius. In
connection with the museum was a botanical and a zoological garden.
These gardens, as their names imply, were for the purpose of
facilitating the study of plants and animals. There was also an
astronomical observatory, containing armillary spheres, globes,
solstitial and equatorial armils, astrolabes, parallactic rules, and
other apparatus then in use, the graduation on the divided instruments
being into degrees and sixths.</p>

<p>3. <i>For the diffusion of knowledge.</i> In the museum was given, by
lectures, conversation, or other appropriate methods, instruction in all
the various departments of human knowledge.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span></p><p><i>There flocked to this great intellectual centre, students from all
countries.</i> It is said that at one time not fewer than fourteen thousand
were in attendance. Subsequently even the Christian church received from
it some of the most eminent of its Fathers, as Clemens Alexandrinus,
Origen, Athanasius, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The library in the museum was burned during the siege of Alexandria by
Julius C&aelig;sar. To make amends for this great loss, the library collected
by Eumenes, King of Pergamus, was presented by Mark Antony to Queen
Cleopatra. Originally it was founded as a rival to that of the
Ptolemies. It was added to the collection in the Serapion, or the temple
of Serapis.<a name="FNanchor_440:1_2307" id="FNanchor_440:1_2307"></a><a href="#Footnote_440:1_2307" class="fnanchor">[440:1]</a></p>

<p>It was not destined, however, to remain there many centuries, as this
very valuable library was willfully destroyed by the Christian
Theophilus, and on the spot where this beautiful temple of Serapis
stood, in fact, on its very foundation, was erected a church in honor of
the "noble army of martyrs," who had never existed.</p>

<p>This we learn from the historian Gibbon, who says that, after this
library was destroyed, "the appearance of the empty shelves excited the
regret and indignation of every spectator, whose mind was not totally
darkened by religious prejudice."<a name="FNanchor_440:2_2308" id="FNanchor_440:2_2308"></a><a href="#Footnote_440:2_2308" class="fnanchor">[440:2]</a></p>

<p>The destruction of this library was almost the death-blow to
free-thought&mdash;wherever Christianity ruled&mdash;for more than a thousand
years.</p>

<p>The death-blow was soon to be struck, however, which was done by <i>Saint
Cyril</i>, who succeeded <i>Theophilus</i> as Bishop of Alexandria.</p>

<p><i>Hypatia</i>, the daughter of Theon, the mathematician, endeavored to
continue the old-time instructions. Each day before her academy stood a
long train of chariots; her lecture-room was crowded with the wealth and
fashion of <i>Alexandria</i>. They came to listen to her discourses on those
questions which man in all ages has asked, but which have never yet been
answered: "What am I? Where am I? What can I know?"</p>

<p>Hypatia and Cyril; philosophy and bigotry; they cannot exist together.
As Hypatia repaired to her academy, she was assaulted by (Saint) Cyril's
mob&mdash;<i>a mob of many monks</i>. Stripped naked in the street, she was
dragged into a <i>church</i>, and there killed <i>by the club of Peter the
Reader</i>. The corpse was cut to pieces, the flesh was scraped from the
bones with shells, and the remnants cast into a fire. <i>For this
frightful crime Cyril was never called to account. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>It seemed to be
admitted that the end sanctified the means. So ended Greek philosophy in
Alexandria</i>, so came to an untimely close the learning that the
Ptolemies had done so much to promote.</p>

<p>The fate of Hypatia was a warning to all who would cultivate profane
knowledge. <i>Henceforth there was to be no freedom for human thought.
Every one must think as ecclesiastical authority ordered him</i>; <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span>
414. In Athens itself philosophy awaited its doom. Justinian at length
prohibited its teaching and caused all its schools in that city to be
closed.<a name="FNanchor_441:1_2309" id="FNanchor_441:1_2309"></a><a href="#Footnote_441:1_2309" class="fnanchor">[441:1]</a></p>

<p>After this followed the long and dreary <i>dark ages</i>, but the <i>sun of
science</i>, that bright and glorious luminary, was destined to rise again.</p>

<p>The history of this great Alexandrian library is one of the keys which
unlock the door, and exposes to our view the manner in which the Hindoo
incarnate god <i>Crishna</i>, and the meek and benevolent <i>Buddha</i>, came to
be worshiped under the name of <i>Christ Jesus</i>. For instance, we have
just seen:</p>

<p>1. That, "orders were given to the chief librarian to buy at the king's
expense <i>whatever books he could</i>."</p>

<p>2. That, "one of the chief objects of the museum was that of serving as
the home of a <i>body of men</i> who devoted themselves to study."</p>

<p>3. That, "any books brought by foreigners into Egypt were taken at once
to the museum and correct copies made."</p>

<p>4. That, "there flocked to this great intellectual centre students from
all countries."</p>

<p>5. That, "the Christian church received from it some of the most eminent
of its Fathers."</p>

<p>And also:</p>

<p>6. That, the chief doctrines of the Gnostic Christians "had been held
for centuries before their time in many of the cities in Asia Minor.
There, it is probable, they first came into existence as 'Myst&aelig;,' <i>upon
the establishment of a direct intercourse with India</i> under the
Seleucid&aelig; and the Ptolemies."</p>

<p>7. That, "the College of <span class="smcap">Essenes</span> at Ephesus, the Orphics of Thrace, the
Curetes of Crete, <i>are all merely branches of one</i> antique and common
religion, <i>and that originally Asiatic</i>."</p>

<p>8. That, "<i>the introduction of Buddhism into Egypt and Palestine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>affords the only true solution of innumerable difficulties in the
history of religion</i>."</p>

<p>9. That, "<i>Buddhism</i> had actually been planted in the dominions of the
Seleucid&aelig; and Ptolemies (Palestine belonging to the former) <i>before the
beginning of the third century</i> <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> and is proved to demonstration by
a passage in the edicts of Asoka."</p>

<p>10. That, "it is very likely that the commentaries (Scriptures) which
were among them (the <i>Essenes</i>) were the Gospels."</p>

<p>11. That, "the principal doctrines and rites of the <i>Essenes</i> can be
connected with the East, with Parsism, and especially with <i>Buddhism</i>."</p>

<p>12. That, "among the doctrines which the <i>Essenes</i> and <i>Buddhists</i> had
in common was that of the <i>Angel-Messiah</i>."</p>

<p>13. That, "they (the <i>Essenes</i>) had a flourishing university or
corporate body, established at <i>Alexandria, in Egypt</i>, long before the
period assigned for the birth of Christ."</p>

<p>14. That, "the <i>very ancient</i> and Eastern doctrine of the
<i>Angel-Messiah</i> had been applied to Gautama Buddha, <i>and so it was
applied to Jesus Christ by the Essenes of Egypt and Palestine</i>, who
introduced this new Messianic doctrine into Essenic Judaism and Essenic
Christianity."</p>

<p>15. That, "we hear very little of them (the <i>Essenes</i>) after <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 40;
and there can hardly be any doubt that the <i>Essenes</i> as a body must have
embraced Christianity."</p>

<p>Here is the solution of the problem. The sacred books of Hindoos and
Buddhists were among the <i>Essenes</i>, and in the library at Alexandria.
The <i>Essenes</i>, who were afterwards called <i>Christians</i>, applied the
legend of the <i>Angel-Messiah</i>&mdash;"the very ancient Eastern doctrine,"
which we have shown throughout this work&mdash;to Christ Jesus. It was simply
a transformation of names, <i>a transformation which had previously
occurred in many cases</i>.<a name="FNanchor_442:1_2310" id="FNanchor_442:1_2310"></a><a href="#Footnote_442:1_2310" class="fnanchor">[442:1]</a> After this came <i>additions</i> to the
legend from other sources. Portions of the legends related of the
Persian, Greek and Roman Saviours and Redeemers of mankind, were, from
time to time, added to the already legendary history of the Christian
Saviour. Thus <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>history was repeating itself. Thus the virgin-born God
and Saviour, worshiped by all nations of the earth, though called by
different names, was but one and the same.</p>

<p>In a subsequent chapter we shall see <i>who</i> this One God was, and <i>how</i>
the myth originated.</p>

<p>Albert Revill&eacute; says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Alexandria</i>, the home of Philonism, and Neo-Platonism (and
we might add <i>Essenism</i>), was naturally the centre <i>whence
spread the dogma of the deity of Jesus Christ</i>. In that city,
through the third century, flourished a school of
transcendental theology, afterwards looked upon with suspicion
by the conservators of ecclesiastical doctrine, but not the
less the real cradle of orthodoxy. It was still the Platonic
tendency which influenced the speculations of Clement, Origen
and Dionysius, and the theory of the Logos was at the
foundation of their theology."<a name="FNanchor_443:1_2311" id="FNanchor_443:1_2311"></a><a href="#Footnote_443:1_2311" class="fnanchor">[443:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Among the numerous gospels in circulation among the Christians of the
first three centuries, there was one entitled "The <a name="Gospel_of_the_Egyptians" id="Gospel_of_the_Egyptians"></a>Gospel of the
<i>Egyptians</i>." Epiphanius (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 385), speaking of it, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Many things are proposed (in this Gospel of the Egyptians) in
a hidden, <i>mysterious manner</i>, as by our Saviour, as though he
had said to his disciples, that the Father was the same
person, the Son the same person, and the Holy Ghost the same
person."</p></div>

<p>That this was one of the "<i>Scriptures</i>" of the Essenes, becomes very
evident when we find it admitted by the most learned of Christian
theologians that it was in existence "<i>before either of the canonical
Gospels</i>," and that it contained the doctrine of the <i>Trinity</i>, a
doctrine not established in the Christian church until <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 327, but
which was taught by this Buddhist sect in Alexandria, in Egypt, which
has been well called, "Egypt, the land of Trinities."</p>

<p>The learned Dr. Grabe thought it was composed by <i>some Christians in
Egypt</i>, and that it was published <i>before either of the canonical
Gospels</i>. Dr. Mill also believed that it was composed <i>before either of
the canonical Gospels</i>, and, what is more important than all, <i>that the
authors of it were Essenes</i>.</p>

<p><i>These "Scriptures" of the Essenes were undoubtedly amalgamated with the
"Gospels" of the Christians, the result being the canonical Gospels as
we now have them.</i> The "Gospel of the Hebrews," and such like, on the
one hand, and the "Gospel of the Egyptians," or Essenes, and such like,
on the other. That the "Gospel of the Hebrews" spoke of Jesus of
Nazareth as the son of Joseph and Mary, <i>according to the flesh</i>, and
that it taught <i>nothing</i> about his miracles, his resurrection from the
dead, and other such <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>prodigies, is admitted on all hands. That the
"Scriptures" of the Essenes contained the whole legend of the
Angel-Messiah, which was afterwards added to the history of Jesus,
<i>making him a</i> <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, <i>or an Anointed Angel</i>, is a probability almost
to a certainty. Do we now understand how all the traditions and legends,
originally <i>Indian</i>, escaping from the great focus through <i>Egypt</i>, were
able to reach Judea, Greece and Rome?</p>

<p>To continue with our subject, "why Christianity prospered," we must now
speak of another great support to the cause, <i>i. e.</i>, <i>Persecution</i>.
Ernest de Bunsen, speaking of Buddha, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"His religion has never been propagated by the sword. It has
been effected entirely by the influence of peaceable and
persevering devotees."</p></div>

<p>Can we say as much for what is termed "the religion of Christ?" No! this
religion has had the aid of the sword and firebrand, the rack and the
thumb-screw. "<i>Persecution</i>," is to be seen written on the pages of
ecclesiastical history, from the time of Constantine even to the present
day.<a name="FNanchor_444:1_2312" id="FNanchor_444:1_2312"></a><a href="#Footnote_444:1_2312" class="fnanchor">[444:1]</a> This Christian emperor and saint was the first to check
free-thought.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We search in vain," (says M. Renan), "in the collection of
Roman laws <i>before Constantine</i>, for any enactment aimed at
free thought, or in the history of the emperors, for a
persecution of abstract doctrine. Not a single <i>savant</i> was
disturbed. Men whom the Middle Ages would have burned&mdash;such as
Galen, Lucian, Plotinus&mdash;lived in peace, protected by the
law."<a name="FNanchor_444:2_2313" id="FNanchor_444:2_2313"></a><a href="#Footnote_444:2_2313" class="fnanchor">[444:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Born and educated a pagan, Constantine embraced the Christian faith from
the following motives. Having committed horrid crimes, in fact, having
committed murders,<a name="FNanchor_444:3_2314" id="FNanchor_444:3_2314"></a><a href="#Footnote_444:3_2314" class="fnanchor">[444:3]</a> and,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When he would have had his (Pagan) priests purge him by
sacrifice, of these horrible murders, and could not have his
purpose (for they answered plainly, it lay not in their power
to cleanse him)<a name="FNanchor_444:4_2315" id="FNanchor_444:4_2315"></a><a href="#Footnote_444:4_2315" class="fnanchor">[444:4]</a> he lighted at last upon an <i>Egyptian</i>
who came out of Iberia, and being persuaded by him that the
Christian faith was of force to wipe away every sin, were it
ever so heinous, he embraced willingly at whatever the
Egyptian told him."<a name="FNanchor_444:5_2316" id="FNanchor_444:5_2316"></a><a href="#Footnote_444:5_2316" class="fnanchor">[444:5]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span></p><p>Mons. Dupuis, speaking of this conversion, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Constantine, soiled with all sorts of crimes, and stained
with the blood of his wife, after repeated perjuries and
assassinations, presented himself before the heathen priests
in order to be absolved of so many outrages he had committed.
He was answered, that amongst the various kinds of expiations,
there was none which could expiate so many crimes, and that no
religion whatever could offer efficient protection against the
justice of the gods; and Constantine was emperor. One of the
courtiers of the palace, who witnessed the trouble and
agitation of his mind, torn by remorse, which nothing could
appease, informed him, that the evil he was suffering was not
without a remedy; that there existed in the religion of the
Christians certain purifications, which expiated every kind of
misdeeds, of whatever nature, and in whatsoever number they
were: that one of the promises of the religion was, that
whoever was converted to it, as impious and as great a villain
as he might be, could hope that his crimes were immediately
forgotten.<a name="FNanchor_445:1_2317" id="FNanchor_445:1_2317"></a><a href="#Footnote_445:1_2317" class="fnanchor">[445:1]</a> From that moment, Constantine declared
himself the protector of a sect which treats great criminals
with so much lenity.<a name="FNanchor_445:2_2318" id="FNanchor_445:2_2318"></a><a href="#Footnote_445:2_2318" class="fnanchor">[445:2]</a> He was a great villain, who tried
to lull himself with illusions to smother his remorse."<a name="FNanchor_445:3_2319" id="FNanchor_445:3_2319"></a><a href="#Footnote_445:3_2319" class="fnanchor">[445:3]</a></p></div>

<p>By the delay of baptism, a person who had accepted the <i>true</i> faith
could venture freely to indulge their passions in the enjoyment of this
world, while they still retained in their own hands the means of
salvation; therefore, we find that Constantine, although he accepted the
faith, did not get baptized until he was on his death-bed, as he wished
to continue, as long as possible, the wicked life he was leading. Mr.
Gibbon, speaking of him, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The example and reputation of Constantine seemed to
countenance the delay of baptism. Future tyrants were
encouraged to believe, that the innocent blood which they
might shed in a long reign would instantly be washed away in
the waters of regeneration; and the abuse of religion
dangerously undermined the foundations of moral
virtue."<a name="FNanchor_445:4_2320" id="FNanchor_445:4_2320"></a><a href="#Footnote_445:4_2320" class="fnanchor">[445:4]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span></p><p>Eusebius, in his "Life of Constantine," tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>When he thought that he was near his death</i>, he confessed
his sins, desiring pardon for them of God, and was baptized.</p>

<p>"Before doing so, he assembled the bishops of Nicomedia
together, and spake thus unto them:</p>

<p>"'Brethren, the salvation which I have earnestly desired of
God these many years, I do now this day expect. It is time
therefore that we should be sealed and signed with the badge
of immortality. And though I proposed to receive it in the
river Jordan, in which our Saviour for our example was
baptized, yet God, knowing what is fittest for me, hath
appointed that I shall receive it in this place, <i>therefore
let me not be delayed</i>.'"</p>

<p>"And so, after the service of baptism was read, they baptized
him with all the ceremonies belonging to this mysterious
sacrament. So that Constantine was the first of all the
emperors who was regenerated by the new birth of baptism, and
that was signed with the sign of the cross."<a name="FNanchor_446:1_2321" id="FNanchor_446:1_2321"></a><a href="#Footnote_446:1_2321" class="fnanchor">[446:1]</a></p></div>

<p>When Constantine had heard the good news from the Christian monk from
Egypt, he commenced by conferring many dignities on the Christians, and
those only who were addicted to Christianity, he made governors of his
provinces, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_446:2_2322" id="FNanchor_446:2_2322"></a><a href="#Footnote_446:2_2322" class="fnanchor">[446:2]</a> He then issued edicts against heretics,&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
those who, like Arius, did not believe that Christ was "<i>of one
substance with the Father</i>," and others&mdash;calling them "enemies of truth
and eternal life," "authors and councillors of death," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_446:3_2323" id="FNanchor_446:3_2323"></a><a href="#Footnote_446:3_2323" class="fnanchor">[446:3]</a> He
"<i>commanded by law</i>" that none should dare "to meet at conventicles,"
and that "all places where they were wont to keep their meetings should
be <i>demolished</i>," or "confiscated to the Catholic church;"<a name="FNanchor_446:4_2324" id="FNanchor_446:4_2324"></a><a href="#Footnote_446:4_2324" class="fnanchor">[446:4]</a> <i>and
Constantine was emperor</i>. "By this means," says Eusebius, "<i>such as
maintained doctrines and opinions contrary to the church, were
suppressed.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_446:5_2325" id="FNanchor_446:5_2325"></a><a href="#Footnote_446:5_2325" class="fnanchor">[446:5]</a></p>

<p>This Constantine, says Eusebius:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Caused his image to be engraven on his gold coins, in the
form of prayer, with his hands joined together, and looking up
towards Heaven." "And over divers gates of his palace, he was
drawn praying, and lifting up his hands and eyes to
heaven."<a name="FNanchor_446:6_2326" id="FNanchor_446:6_2326"></a><a href="#Footnote_446:6_2326" class="fnanchor">[446:6]</a></p></div>

<p>After his death, "effigies of this blessed man" were engraved on the
Roman coins, "sitting in and driving a chariot, and a hand reached down
from heaven to receive and take him up."<a name="FNanchor_446:7_2327" id="FNanchor_446:7_2327"></a><a href="#Footnote_446:7_2327" class="fnanchor">[446:7]</a></p>

<p>The hopes of wealth and honors, the example of an emperor, his
exhortations, his irresistible smiles, diffused conviction among <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>the
venal and obsequious crowds which <ins class="corr" title="original has unsually">usually</ins> fill the apartments of a
palace, and as the lower ranks of society are governed by example, the
conversion of those who possessed any eminence of birth, of power, or of
riches, <i>was soon followed by dependent multitudes</i>. Constantine passed
a law which gave freedom to all the slaves who should embrace
Christianity, and to those who were not slaves, he gave a white garment
and twenty pieces of gold, upon their embracing the Christian faith. The
common people were thus <i>purchased</i> at such an easy rate that, in one
year, <i>twelve thousand men were baptised at Rome</i>, besides a
proportionable number of women and children.<a name="FNanchor_447:1_2328" id="FNanchor_447:1_2328"></a><a href="#Footnote_447:1_2328" class="fnanchor">[447:1]</a></p>

<p>To suppress the opinions of philosophers, which were contrary to
Christianity, the Christian emperors published edicts. The respective
decrees of the emperors Constantine and Theodosius,<a name="FNanchor_447:2_2329" id="FNanchor_447:2_2329"></a><a href="#Footnote_447:2_2329" class="fnanchor">[447:2]</a> generally ran
in the words, "that all writings adverse to the claims of the Christian
religion, in the possession of whomsoever they should be found, should
be committed to the fire," as the pious emperors would not that those
things tending to provoke God to wrath, should be allowed to offend the
minds of the piously disposed.</p>

<p>The following is a decree of the Emperor Theodosius of this purport:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We decree, therefore, that all writings, whatever, which
Porphyry or anyone else hath written against the Christian
religion, in the possession of whomsoever they shall be found
should be committed to the fire; for we would not suffer any
of those things so much as to come to men's ears, which tend
to provoke God to wrath and offend the minds of the
<i>pious</i>."<a name="FNanchor_447:3_2330" id="FNanchor_447:3_2330"></a><a href="#Footnote_447:3_2330" class="fnanchor">[447:3]</a></p></div>

<p>A similar decree of the emperor for establishing the doctrine of the
Trinity, concludes with an admonition to all who shall object to it,
that,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Besides the condemnation of divine justice, they must expect
to suffer the severe penalties, which <i>our</i> authority, guided
by heavenly wisdom, may think proper to inflict upon
them."<a name="FNanchor_447:4_2331" id="FNanchor_447:4_2331"></a><a href="#Footnote_447:4_2331" class="fnanchor">[447:4]</a></p></div>

<p>This orthodox emperor (Theodosius) considered every heretic (as he
called those who did not believe as he and his ecclesiastics
<i>professed</i>) a rebel against the supreme powers of heaven and of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>earth
(he being one of the supreme powers of earth), <i>and each of the powers</i>
might exercise their peculiar jurisdiction <i>over the soul and body of
the guilty</i>.</p>

<p>The decrees of the Council of Constantinople had ascertained the <i>true</i>
standard of the faith, <i>and the ecclesiastics, who governed the
conscience of Theodosius, suggested the most effectual methods of
persecution</i>. In the space of fifteen years he promulgated at least
fifteen severe edicts against the heretics, <i>more especially against
those who rejected the doctrine of the Trinity</i>.<a name="FNanchor_448:1_2332" id="FNanchor_448:1_2332"></a><a href="#Footnote_448:1_2332" class="fnanchor">[448:1]</a></p>

<p><i>Arius</i> (the presbyter of whom we have spoken in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXXV">Chapter XXXV.</a>, as
declaring that, in the nature of things, <i>a father must be older than
his son</i>) was <i>excommunicated</i> for his so-called <i>heretical</i> notions
concerning the Trinity. His followers, who were very numerous, were
called Arians. Their writings, <i>if they had been permitted to
exist</i>,<a name="FNanchor_448:2_2333" id="FNanchor_448:2_2333"></a><a href="#Footnote_448:2_2333" class="fnanchor">[448:2]</a> would undoubtedly contain the lamentable story of the
persecution which affected the church under the reign of the impious
Emperor <i>Theodosius</i>.</p>

<p>In Asia Minor the people were persecuted by orders of Constantius, and
these orders were more than obeyed by Macedonius. The civil and military
powers were ordered to obey his commands; the consequence was, he
disgraced the reign of Constantius. "The rites of baptism were conferred
on women and children, who, for that purpose, had been torn from the
arms of their friends and parents; the mouths of the communicants were
held open by a wooden engine, while the consecrated bread was forced
down their throats; the breasts of tender virgins were either burned
with red-hot egg-shells, or inhumanly compressed between sharp and heavy
boards."<a name="FNanchor_448:3_2334" id="FNanchor_448:3_2334"></a><a href="#Footnote_448:3_2334" class="fnanchor">[448:3]</a> The principal assistants of Macedonius&mdash;the tool of
Constantius&mdash;in the work of persecution, were the two bishops of
Nicomedia and Cyzicus, who were esteemed for their virtues, and
especially for their charity.<a name="FNanchor_448:4_2335" id="FNanchor_448:4_2335"></a><a href="#Footnote_448:4_2335" class="fnanchor">[448:4]</a></p>

<p>Julian, the successor of Constantius, has described some of the
theological calamities which afflicted the empire, and more especially
in the East, in the reign of a prince who was the slave of his own
passions, and of those of his eunuchs: "Many were imprisoned, and
persecuted, and driven into exile. Whole troops of those who are styled
<i>heretics</i> were massacred, particularly at Cyzicus, and at Samosata. In
Paphlagonia, Bithynia, Gallatia, and in many <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>other provinces, towns and
villages were laid waste, and utterly destroyed."<a name="FNanchor_449:1_2336" id="FNanchor_449:1_2336"></a><a href="#Footnote_449:1_2336" class="fnanchor">[449:1]</a></p>

<p>Persecutions in the name of Christ Jesus were inflicted on the heathen
in most every part of the then known world. Even among the Norwegians,
the Christian sword was unsheathed. They clung tenaciously to the
worship of their forefathers, and numbers of them died real martyrs for
their faith, after suffering the most cruel torments from their
persecutors. It was by sheer compulsion that the Norwegians embraced
Christianity. The reign of Olaf Tryggvason, a Christian king of Norway,
was in fact entirely devoted to the propagation of the new faith, by
means the most revolting to humanity. His general practice was to enter
a district at the head of a formidable force, summon a <i>Thing</i>,<a name="FNanchor_449:2_2337" id="FNanchor_449:2_2337"></a><a href="#Footnote_449:2_2337" class="fnanchor">[449:2]</a>
and give the people the alternative of fighting with him, or of being
baptized. Most of them, of course, preferred baptism to the risk of a
battle with an adversary so well prepared for combat; and the recusants
were tortured to death with fiend-like ferocity, and their estates
confiscated.<a name="FNanchor_449:3_2338" id="FNanchor_449:3_2338"></a><a href="#Footnote_449:3_2338" class="fnanchor">[449:3]</a></p>

<p>These are some of the reasons "why Christianity prospered."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The learned Christian historian Pagi endeavors to smoothe over
the crimes of Constantine. He says: "As for those few murders (which
Eusebius says nothing about), had he thought it worth his while to refer
to them, he would perhaps, with Baronius himself have said, that the
young Licinius (his infant nephew), although the fact might not
generally have been known, had most likely been an accomplice in the
treason of his father. That as to the murder of his son, the Emperor is
rather to be considered as unfortunate than as criminal. And with
respect to his putting his wife to death, he ought to be pronounced
rather a just and righteous judge. As for his numerous friends, whom
Eutropius informs us he put to death one after another, we are bound to
believe that most of them deserved it, and they were found out to have
abused the Emperor's too great credulity, for the gratification of their
own inordinate wickedness, and insatiable avarice; and such no doubt was
that <span class="smcap">Sopater</span> the <ins class="corr" title="philospher">philosopher</ins>, who was at last put to death upon the
accusation of Adlabius, and that by the righteous dispensation of God,
for his having attempted to alienate the mind of Constantine from the
true religion." (<i>Pagi Ann.</i> 324, quoted in Latin by Dr. Lardner, vol.
iv. p. 371, in his notes for the benefit of the <i>learned</i> reader, but
gives no rendering into English.)</p>

Anacalypsis. It should be remembered that Gautama Buddha, the
"Angel-Messiah," and Cyrus, the "Anointed" of the Lord, are placed about
six hundred years before Jesus, the "Anointed." This cycle of six
hundred years was called the "<i>great year</i>." Josephus, the Jewish
historian, alludes to it when speaking of the patriarchs that lived to a
great age. "God afforded them a longer time of life," says he, "on
account of their virtue, and the good use they made of it in
astronomical and geometrical discoveries, which would not have afforded
the time for foretelling (the periods of the stars), unless they had
lived <i>six hundred years</i>; for the <i>great year</i> is completed in that
interval." (Josephus, Antiq., bk. i. c. iii.) "From this cycle of <i>six
hundred</i>," says Col. Vallancey, "came the name of the bird Ph&oelig;nix,
called by the Egyptians Phenu, with the well-known story of its going to
Egypt to burn itself on the altar of the Sun (at Heliopolis) and rise
again from its ashes, at the end of a certain period."</p></div>

to a certainty, that already in his time the Essenes did expect an
Angel-Messiah as one of a series of divine incarnations. Within about
fifty years after Philo's death, Elkesai the Essene probably applied
this doctrine to Jesus, and it was promulgated in Rome about the same
time, if not earlier, by the Pseudo-Clementines." (Bunsen: The
Angel-Messiah, p. 118.)</p>

<p>"There was, at this time (<i>i. e.</i>, at the time of the birth of Jesus), a
prevalent expectation that some remarkable personage was about to appear
in Judea. The Jews were anxiously looking for the coming of the
<i>Messiah</i>. By computing the time mentioned by Daniel (ch. ix. 23-27),
they knew that the period was approaching when the Messiah should
appear. This personage, <i>they supposed</i>, would be a temporal prince, and
they were expecting that he would deliver them from Roman bondage. <i>It
was natural that this expectation should spread into other countries.</i>"

alike, in Christ's day, was, that the Messiah would be simply a great
prince, who should found a kingdom of matchless splendor." "With a few,
however, the conception of the Messiah's kingdom was pure and lofty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Daniel, and all who wrote after him, painted the 'Expected One' as a
<i>heavenly being</i>. He was the 'messenger,' the 'Elect of God,' appointed
from eternity, to appear in due time, and <i>redeem</i> his people."
(Geikie's Life of Christ, vol. i. pp. 80, 81.)</p>

<p>In the book of <i>Daniel</i>, by some supposed to have been written during
the captivity, by others as late as Antiochus Epiphanes (<span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> 75), the
restoration of the Jews is described in tremendous language, and the
Messiah is portrayed as a supernatural personage, in close relation with
Jehovah himself. In the book of Enoch, supposed to have been written at
various intervals between 144 and 120 (<span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>) and to have been completed
in its present form in the first half of the second century that
preceded the advent of Jesus, the figure of the Messiah is invested with
superhuman attributes. He is called "The Son of God," "whose name was
spoken before the Sun was made;" "who existed from the beginning in the
presence of God," that is, was pre-existent. At the same time his human
characteristics are insisted on. He is called "Son of Man," even "Son of
Woman," "The Anointed" or "The Christ," "The Righteous One," &amp;c.

<p>Among the ancients, there were many stories current of countries, the
inhabitants of which were of peculiar size, form or features. Our
Christian saint evidently believed these tales, and thinking thus,
sought to make others believe them. We find the following examples
related by <i>Herodotus</i>: "Aristeas, son of Caystrobius, a native of
Proconesus, says in his epic verses that, inspired by Apollo, he came to
the Issedones; that beyond the Issedones dwell the Arimaspians, <i>a
people that have only one eye</i>." (Herodotus, book iv. ch. 13.) "When one
has passed through a considerable extent of the rugged country (of the
Seythians), a people are found living at the foot of lofty mountains,
<i>who are said to be all bald from their birth</i>, both men and women
alike, and they are flat-nosed, and have large chins." (Ibid. ch. 23.)
"These bald men say, what to me is incredible, that <i>men with goat's
feet</i> inhabit these mountains; and when one has passed beyond them,
other men are found, <i>who sleep six months at a time</i>, but this I do not
at all admit." (Ibid. ch. 24.) In the country westward of Libya, "there
are enormous serpents, and lions, elephants, bears, asps, and asses with
horns, and monsters with dog's heads and without heads, <i>who have eyes
in their breasts</i>, at least, as the Libyans say, and wild men and wild
women, and many other wild beasts which are not fabulous." (Ibid. ch.
192.)</p></div>

and Buddha. Mr. Cox, speaking of the former, says: "If it be urged that
the attribution to Crishna of qualities or powers belonging to the other
deities is a mere device by which <i>his</i> devotees sought to supersede the
more ancient gods, <i>the answer must be that nothing has been done in his
case which has not been done in the case of almost every other member of
the great company of the gods</i>." (Aryan Mythology, vol. ii. p. 130.)
These words apply to the case we have before us. Jesus was simply
attributed with the qualities or powers which <i>had been previously
attributed to other deities</i>. This we hope to be able to fully
demonstrate in our chapter on "<a href="#CHAPTER_XXXIX"><i>Explanation</i></a>."</p></div>

without any <i>good</i> excuse, so likewise is the death of the young
Licinianus, who could not have been more than a little above eleven
years of age, and appears not to have been charged with any fault, and
could hardly be suspected of any."</p></div>

Among the proselytes of Christianity, there were many who judged it
imprudent to precipitate a salutary rite, which could not be repeated.
By the delay of their baptism, they could venture freely to indulge
their passions in the enjoyments of this world, while they still
retained in their own hands the means of a sure and speedy absolution."

of Constantine, lib. 1, ch. xxii.), but it must be remembered that
Eusebius acknowledged that he told falsehoods. That night Christ
appeared unto Constantine in his dream, and commanded him to make the
figure of the cross which he had seen, and to wear it in his <i>banner</i>
when he went to battle with his enemies. (See Eusebius' Life of
Constantine, lib. 1, ch. xxiii. See also, Socrates: Eccl. Hist., lib. 1,

censured this criminal delay, could not deny the certain and victorious
efficacy even of a death-bed baptism. The ingenious rhetoric of
Chrysostom (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 347-407) could find only three arguments against these
prudent Christians. 1. "That we should love and pursue virtue for her
own sake, and not merely for the reward. 2. That we may be surprised by
death without an opportunity of baptism. 3. That although we shall be
placed in heaven, we shall only twinkle like little stars, when compared
to the suns of righteousness who have run their appointed course with
labor, with success, and with glory." (Chrysostom in Epist. ad Hebr&aelig;os.

<h3>THE ANTIQUITY OF PAGAN RELIGIONS.</h3>

<p>We shall now compare the great antiquity of the sacred books and
religions of Paganism with those of the Christian, so that there may be
no doubt as to which is the original, and which the copy. Allusions to
this subject have already been made throughout this work, we shall
therefore devote as little space to it here as possible.</p>

<p>In speaking of the sacred literature of India, Prof. Monier Williams
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Sanskrit literature, embracing as it does nearly every branch
of knowledge is entirely deficient in one department. It is
wholly destitute of trustworthy historical records. Hence,
little or nothing is known of the lives of ancient Indian
authors, and the dates of their most celebrated works cannot
be fixed with certainty. A fair conjecture, however, may be
arrived at by comparing the most ancient with the more modern
compositions, and estimating the period of time required to
effect the changes of structure and idiom observable in the
language. In this manner we may be justified in assuming that
the hymns of the Veda were probably composed by a succession
of poets at different dates between 1500 and 1000 years B.
C."<a name="FNanchor_450:1_2339" id="FNanchor_450:1_2339"></a><a href="#Footnote_450:1_2339" class="fnanchor">[450:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Prof. Wm. D. Whitney shows the great antiquity of the Vedic hymns from
the fact that,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The language of the Vedas is an <i>older</i> dialect, varying very
considerably, both in its grammatical and lexical character,
from the classical Sanscrit."</p></div>

<p>And M. de Coulanges, in his "Ancient City," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We learn from the hymns of the <i>Vedas</i>, which are certainly
very ancient, and from the laws of Manu," "what the Aryans of
the east thought nearly thirty-five centuries ago."<a name="FNanchor_450:2_2340" id="FNanchor_450:2_2340"></a><a href="#Footnote_450:2_2340" class="fnanchor">[450:2]</a></p></div>

<p>That the <i>Vedas</i> are of very high antiquity is unquestionable; but
however remote we may place the period when they were written, we must
necessarily presuppose that the Hindostanic race had <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>already attained
to a comparatively high degree of civilization, otherwise men capable of
framing such doctrines could not have been found. Now this state of
civilization must necessarily have been preceded by several centuries of
barbarism, during which we cannot possibly admit a more refined faith
than the popular belief in elementary deities.</p>

<p>We shall see in our <a href="#CHAPTER_XXXIX">next chapter</a> that these very ancient Vedic hymns
contain the <i>origin</i> of the legend of the Virgin-born God and Saviour,
the great benefactor of mankind, who is finally put to death, and rises
again to life and immortality on the third day.</p>

<p>The <i>Geetas</i> and <i>Puranas</i>, although of a comparatively modern date,
are, as we have already seen, nevertheless composed of matter to be
found in the two great epic poems, the <i>Ramayana</i> and the <i>Mahabharata</i>,
which were written many centuries before the time assigned as that of
the birth of Christ Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_451:1_2341" id="FNanchor_451:1_2341"></a><a href="#Footnote_451:1_2341" class="fnanchor">[451:1]</a></p>

<p>The Pali sacred books, which contain the legend of the virgin-born God
and Saviour&mdash;Sommona Cadom&mdash;are known to have been in existence 316 <span class="allcapsc">B.
C.</span><a name="FNanchor_451:2_2342" id="FNanchor_451:2_2342"></a><a href="#Footnote_451:2_2342" class="fnanchor">[451:2]</a></p>

<p>We have already seen that the religion known as Buddhism, and which
corresponds in such a striking manner with Christianity, has now existed
for upwards of twenty-four hundred years.<a name="FNanchor_451:3_2343" id="FNanchor_451:3_2343"></a><a href="#Footnote_451:3_2343" class="fnanchor">[451:3]</a></p>

<p>Prof. Rhys Davids says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is every reason to believe that the <i>Pitakas</i> (the
sacred books which contain the legend of 'The Buddha'), now
extant in Ceylon, are substantially identical with the books
of the Southern Canon, as settled at the Council of Patna
about the year 250 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span><a name="FNanchor_451:4_2344" id="FNanchor_451:4_2344"></a><a href="#Footnote_451:4_2344" class="fnanchor">[451:4]</a> As no works would have been
received into the Canon which were not <i>then</i> believed to be
very old, the <i>Pitakas</i> may be approximately placed in the
<i>fourth century</i> <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, and parts of them possibly reach back
very nearly, if not quite, to the time of Gautama
himself."<a name="FNanchor_451:5_2345" id="FNanchor_451:5_2345"></a><a href="#Footnote_451:5_2345" class="fnanchor">[451:5]</a></p></div>

<p>The religion of the ancient <i>Persians</i>, which corresponds in so very
many respects with that of the Christians, was established by
Zoroaster&mdash;who was undoubtedly a Brahman<a name="FNanchor_451:6_2346" id="FNanchor_451:6_2346"></a><a href="#Footnote_451:6_2346" class="fnanchor">[451:6]</a>&mdash;and is contained <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>in
the <i>Zend-Avesta</i>, their sacred book or Bible. This book is very
ancient. Prof. Max M&uuml;ller speaks of "the sacred book of the
Zoroastrians" as being "older in its language than the cuneiform
inscriptions of Cyrus (<span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> 560), Darius (<span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> 520), and Xerxes (<span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>
485) those ancient Kings of Persia, who knew that they were kings by the
grace of <i>Auramazda</i>, and who placed his sacred image high on the

<p>"The Babylonian and Phenician sacred books date back to a fabulous
antiquity;"<a name="FNanchor_452:3_2349" id="FNanchor_452:3_2349"></a><a href="#Footnote_452:3_2349" class="fnanchor">[452:3]</a> and so do the sacred books and religion of Egypt.</p>

<p>Prof. Mahaffy, in his "Prolegomena to Ancient History," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is indeed hardly a great and fruitful idea in the
Jewish or Christian systems which has not its analogy in the
Egyptian faith, and <i>all these theological conceptions pervade
the oldest religion of Egypt</i>."<a name="FNanchor_452:4_2350" id="FNanchor_452:4_2350"></a><a href="#Footnote_452:4_2350" class="fnanchor">[452:4]</a></p></div>

<p>The worship of Osiris, the Lord and Saviour, must have been of extremely
ancient date, for he is represented as "Judge of the Dead," in
sculptures contemporary with the building of the Pyramids, centuries
before Abraham is said to have been born. Among the many hieroglyphic
titles which accompany his figure in those sculptures, and in many other
places on the walls of temples and tombs, are, "Lord of Life," "The
Eternal Ruler," "Manifester of Good," "Revealer of Truth," "Full of
Goodness and Truth," etc.</p>

<p>In speaking of the "Myth of Osiris," Mr. Bonwick says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This great mystery of the Egyptians demands serious
consideration. Its antiquity&mdash;its universal hold upon the
people for over five thousand years&mdash;its identification with
the very life of the nation&mdash;<i>and its marvellous likeness to
the creed of modern date</i>, unite in exciting the greatest
interest."<a name="FNanchor_452:5_2351" id="FNanchor_452:5_2351"></a><a href="#Footnote_452:5_2351" class="fnanchor">[452:5]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span></p><p>This myth, and that of Isis and Horus, were known before the Pyramid
time.<a name="FNanchor_453:1_2352" id="FNanchor_453:1_2352"></a><a href="#Footnote_453:1_2352" class="fnanchor">[453:1]</a></p>

<p>The worship of the Virgin Mother in Egypt&mdash;from which country it was
imported into Europe<a name="FNanchor_453:2_2353" id="FNanchor_453:2_2353"></a><a href="#Footnote_453:2_2353" class="fnanchor">[453:2]</a>&mdash;dates back thousands of years <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> Mr.
Bonwick says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In all probability she was worshiped three thousand years
before Moses wrote. 'Isis nursing her child Horus, was
represented,' says Mariette Bey, 'at least six thousand years
ago.' We read the name of Isis on monuments of the fourth
dynasty, and she lost none of her popularity to the close of
the empire."</p>

<p>"The Egyptian Bible is by far the most ancient of all holy
books." "Plato was told that Egypt possessed hymns dating back
ten thousand years before his time."<a name="FNanchor_453:3_2354" id="FNanchor_453:3_2354"></a><a href="#Footnote_453:3_2354" class="fnanchor">[453:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Bunsen says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The origin of the ancient prayers and hymns of the 'Book of
the Dead,' is anterior to Menes; it implies that the system of
Osirian worship and mythology was already formed."<a name="FNanchor_453:4_2355" id="FNanchor_453:4_2355"></a><a href="#Footnote_453:4_2355" class="fnanchor">[453:4]</a></p></div>

<p>And, says Mr. Bonwick:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Besides opinions, we have facts as a basis for arriving at a
conclusion, and justifying the assertion of Dr. Birch, that
the work dated from a period long anterior to the rise of
Ammon worship at Thebes."<a name="FNanchor_453:5_2356" id="FNanchor_453:5_2356"></a><a href="#Footnote_453:5_2356" class="fnanchor">[453:5]</a></p></div>

<p>Now, "this most ancient of all holy books," establishes the fact that a
virgin-born and resurrected Saviour was worshiped in Egypt thousands of
year before the time of Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>P. Le Page Renouf says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>earliest monuments</i> which have been discovered present
to us the <i>very same</i> fully-developed civilization and the
<i>same religion</i> as the later monuments.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The gods whose
names appear in the <i>oldest tombs</i> were worshiped down to the
Christian times. The same kind of priesthoods which are
mentioned in the tablets of Canopus and Rosetta in the
Ptolemaic period are as ancient as the pyramids, and more
ancient than any pyramid of which we know the date."<a name="FNanchor_453:6_2357" id="FNanchor_453:6_2357"></a><a href="#Footnote_453:6_2357" class="fnanchor">[453:6]</a></p></div>

<p>In regard to the doctrine of the <i>Trinity</i>. We have just seen that "the
development of the One God into a Trinity" pervades the oldest religion
of Egypt, and the same may be said of India. Prof. Monier Williams,
speaking on this subject, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It should be observed that the native commentaries on the
Veda often allude to thirty-three gods, which number is also
mentioned in the Rig-Veda. This is a multiple of <i>three</i>,
which is a sacred number constantly appearing in the Hindu
religious system. It is probable, indeed, that although the
Tri-murti is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>not named in the Vedic hymns,<a name="FNanchor_454:1_2358" id="FNanchor_454:1_2358"></a><a href="#Footnote_454:1_2358" class="fnanchor">[454:1]</a> yet the
Veda is the real source of this Triad of personifications,
afterwards so conspicuous in Hindu mythology. This much, at
least, is clear, that the Vedic poets exhibited a tendency to
group all the forces and energies of nature under three heads,
and the assertion that the number of the gods was
thirty-three, amounted to saying that each of the three
leading personifications was capable of eleven
modifications."<a name="FNanchor_454:2_2359" id="FNanchor_454:2_2359"></a><a href="#Footnote_454:2_2359" class="fnanchor">[454:2]</a></p></div>

<p>The great antiquity of the legends referred to in this work is
demonstrated in the fact that they were found in a great measure on the
continent of America, by the first Europeans who set foot on its soil.
Now, how did they get there? Mr. Lundy, in his "Monumental
Christianity," speaking on this subject, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"So great was the resemblance between the two sacraments of
the Christian Church (viz., that of Baptism and the Eucharist)
and those of the ancient Mexicans; so many other points of
similarity, also, in <i>doctrine</i> existed, as to the unity of
God, the Triad, the Creation, the Incarnation and Sacrifice,
the Resurrection, etc., that Herman Witsius, no mean scholar
and thinker, was induced to believe that Christianity had been
preached on this continent by some one of the apostles,
perhaps St. Thomas, from the fact that he is reported to have
carried the Gospel to India and Tartary, whence he came to
America."<a name="FNanchor_454:3_2360" id="FNanchor_454:3_2360"></a><a href="#Footnote_454:3_2360" class="fnanchor">[454:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Some writers, who do not think that St. Thomas could have gotten to
America, believe that St. Patrick, or some other saint, must have, in
some unaccountable manner, reached the shores of the Western continent,
and preached their doctrine there.<a name="FNanchor_454:4_2361" id="FNanchor_454:4_2361"></a><a href="#Footnote_454:4_2361" class="fnanchor">[454:4]</a> Others have advocated the
devil theory, which is, that the devil, being jealous of the worship of
Christ Jesus, set up a religion of his own, and imitated, nearly as
possible, the religion of Christ. All of these theories being untenable,
we must, in the words of Burnouf, the eminent French Orientalist, "learn
one day that all ancient traditions disfigured by emigration and legend,
<i>belong to the history of India</i>."</p>

<p>That America was inhabited by Asiatic emigrants, and that the American
legends are of <i>Asiatic origin</i>, we believe to be indisputable. There is
an abundance of proof to this effect.<a name="FNanchor_454:5_2362" id="FNanchor_454:5_2362"></a><a href="#Footnote_454:5_2362" class="fnanchor">[454:5]</a></p>

<p>In contrast to the great antiquity of the sacred books and religions of
Paganism, we have the facts that the Gospels were not written by the
persons whose names they bear, that they were written many years after
the time these men are said to have lived, and that they are full of
interpolations and errors. The first that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>we know of the four gospels
is at the time of Iren&aelig;us, who, in the second century, intimates that he
had received four gospels, as authentic scriptures. This pious forger
was probably the author of the <i>fourth</i>, as we shall presently see.</p>

<p>Besides these gospels there were many more which were subsequently
deemed apocryphal; the narratives related in them of Christ Jesus and
his apostles were stamped as forgeries.</p>

<p>"The Gospel according to Matthew" is believed by the majority of
biblical scholars of the present day to be the oldest of the four, and
to be made up principally of a pre-existing one, called "The Gospel of
the Hebrews." The principal difference in these two gospels being that
"<i>The Gospel of the Hebrews</i>" commenced with giving the genealogy of
Jesus from David, through Joseph "<i>according to the flesh</i>." The story
of Jesus being born of a virgin <i>was not to be found there</i>, it being an
afterpiece, originating either with the writer of "<i>The Gospel according
to Matthew</i>," or some one after him, and was evidently taken from "The
Gospel of the Egyptians." "<i>The Gospel of the Hebrews</i>"&mdash;from which, we
have said, the <i>Matthew</i> narrator copied&mdash;<i>was an intensely Jewish
gospel</i>, and was to be found&mdash;in one of its forms&mdash;among the Ebionites,
who were the narrowest Jewish Christians of the second century. "<i>The
Gospel according to Matthew</i>" is, therefore, the most Jewish gospel of
the four; in fact, the most Jewish book in the New Testament, excepting,
perhaps, the <i>Apocalypse</i> and the <i>Epistle of James</i>.</p>

<p>Some of the more conspicuous Jewish traits, to be found in this gospel,
are as follows:</p>

<p>Jesus is sent <i>only</i> to the lost sheep of the house of <i>Israel</i>. The
twelve are forbidden to go among the <i>Gentiles</i> or the <i>Samaritans</i>.
They are to sit on twelve thrones, <i>judging the twelve tribes of
Israel</i>. The genealogy of Jesus is traced back to <i>Abraham</i>, and there
stops.<a name="FNanchor_455:1_2363" id="FNanchor_455:1_2363"></a><a href="#Footnote_455:1_2363" class="fnanchor">[455:1]</a> The works of the <i>law</i> are frequently insisted on. There
is a superstitious regard for the <i>Sabbath</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>There is no evidence of the existence of the Gospel of Matthew,&mdash;<i>in its
present form</i>&mdash;until the year 173, <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> It is at this time, also, that
it is first ascribed to Matthew, by Apollinaris, Bishop of Hierapolis.
The original oracles of the Gospel of the Hebrews, however,&mdash;which were
made use of by the author of our present <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>Gospel of Matthew,&mdash;were
written, likely enough, not long before the destruction of Jerusalem,
but the Gospel itself dates from about <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 100.<a name="FNanchor_456:1_2364" id="FNanchor_456:1_2364"></a><a href="#Footnote_456:1_2364" class="fnanchor">[456:1]</a></p>

<p>"<i>The Gospel according to Luke</i>" is believed to come next&mdash;in
chronological order&mdash;to that of Matthew, and to have been written some
fifteen or twenty years after it. The author was a <i>foreigner</i>, as his
writings plainly show that he was far removed from the events which he
records.</p>

<p>In writing his Gospel, the author made use of that of Matthew, the
Gospel of the Hebrews, and Marcion's Gospel. He must have had, also,
still other sources, as there are parables peculiar to it, which are not
found in them. Among these may be mentioned that of the "<i>Prodigal
Son</i>," and the "<i>Good Samaritan</i>." Other parables peculiar to it are
that of the two debtors; the friend borrowing bread at night; the rich
man's barns; Dives and Lazarus; the lost piece of silver; the unjust
steward; the Pharisee and the Publican.</p>

<p>Several miracles are also peculiar to the Luke narrator's Gospel, the
raising of the widow of Nain's son being the most remarkable. Perhaps
these stories were delivered to him <i>orally</i>, and perhaps <i>he is the
author of them</i>,&mdash;we shall never know. The foundation of the legends,
however, undoubtedly came from the "<i>certain scriptures</i>" of the Essenes
in Egypt. The principal <i>object</i> which the writer of this gospel had in
view was to reconcile <i>Paulinism</i> and the <i>more Jewish</i> forms of
Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_456:2_2365" id="FNanchor_456:2_2365"></a><a href="#Footnote_456:2_2365" class="fnanchor">[456:2]</a></p>

<p>The next in chronological order, according to the same school of
critics, is "The Gospel according to Mark." This gospel is supposed to
have been written within ten years of the former, and its author, as of
the other two gospels, is unknown. It was probably written at <i>Rome</i>, as
the Latinisms of the author's style, and the apparent motive of his
work, strongly suggest that he was a Jewish citizen of the Eternal City.
He made use of the Gospel of Matthew as his principal authority, and
probably referred to that of Luke, as he has things in common with Luke
only.</p>

<p>The object which the writer had in view, was to have a neutral
go-between, a compromise between Matthew as too Petrine (Jewish), and
Luke as too Pauline (Gentile). The different aspects of Matthew and Luke
were found to be confusing to believers, and provocative of hostile
criticism from without; hence the idea of writing a shorter gospel, that
should combine the most essential elements of both. Luke was itself a
compromise between the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>opposing Jewish and universal tendencies of
early Christianity, but Mark endeavors by avoidance and omission to
effect what Luke did more by addition and contrast. Luke proposed to
himself to open a door for the admission of Pauline ideas without
offending Gentile Christianity; Mark, on the contrary, in a negative
spirit, to publish a Gospel which should not hurt the feelings of either
party. Hence his avoidance of all those disputed questions which
disturbed the church during the first quarter of the second century. The
genealogy of Jesus is omitted; this being offensive to Gentile
Christians, and even to some of the more liberal Judaizers. The
supernatural birth of Jesus is omitted, this being offensive to the
Ebonitish (extreme Jewish) and some of the Gnostic Christians. For every
Judaizing feature that is sacrificed, a universal one is also
sacrificed. Hard words against the Jews are left out, but with equal
care, hard words about the Gentiles.<a name="FNanchor_457:1_2366" id="FNanchor_457:1_2366"></a><a href="#Footnote_457:1_2366" class="fnanchor">[457:1]</a></p>

<p>We now come to the fourth, and last gospel, that "<i>according to John</i>,"
which was not written until many years after that "according to
Matthew."</p>

<p>"It is impossible to pass from the Synoptic<a name="FNanchor_457:2_2367" id="FNanchor_457:2_2367"></a><a href="#Footnote_457:2_2367" class="fnanchor">[457:2]</a> Gospels," says Canon
Westcott, "to the fourth, without feeling that the transition involves
the passage from one world of thought to another. No familiarity with
the general teachings of the Gospels, no wide conception of the
character of the Saviour, is sufficient to destroy the contrast which
exists in form and spirit between the earlier and later narratives."</p>

<p>The discrepancies between the fourth and the Synoptic Gospels are
numerous. If Jesus was the <i>man</i> of Matthew's Gospel, he was not the
<i>mysterious being</i> of the fourth. If his ministry was only <i>one</i> year
long, it was not <i>three</i>. If he made but <i>one</i> journey to Jerusalem, he
did not make <i>many</i>. If his method of teaching was that of the
Synoptics, it was not that of the fourth Gospel. If he was the <i>Jew</i> of
Matthew, he was not the <i>Anti-Jew</i> of John.<a name="FNanchor_457:3_2368" id="FNanchor_457:3_2368"></a><a href="#Footnote_457:3_2368" class="fnanchor">[457:3]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p><p>Everywhere in John we come upon a more developed stage of Christianity
than in the Synoptics. The scene, the atmosphere, is different. In the
Synoptics Judaism, the Temple, the Law and the Messianic Kingdom are
omnipresent. In John they are remote and vague. In Matthew Jesus is
always yearning for <i>his own</i> nation. In John he has no other sentiment
for it than <i>hate and scorn</i>. In Matthew the sanction of the Prophets is
his great credential. In John his dignity can tolerate no previous
approximation.</p>

<p>"Do we ask," says Francis Tiffany, "who wrote this wondrous Gospel?
Mysterious its origin, as that wind of which its author speaks, which
bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof and canst
not tell whence it cometh or whither it goeth. As with the Great Unknown
of the book of Job, the Great Unknown of the later Isaiah, the ages keep
his secret. <i>The first absolutely indisputable evidence of the existence
of the book dates from the latter half of the second century.</i>"</p>

<p>The first that we know of the <i>fourth</i> Gospel, for certainty, is at the
time of Iren&aelig;us (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 179).<a name="FNanchor_458:1_2369" id="FNanchor_458:1_2369"></a><a href="#Footnote_458:1_2369" class="fnanchor">[458:1]</a> We look in vain for an express
recognition of the <i>four</i> canonical Gospels, or for a <i>distinct mention</i>
of any one of them, in the writings of St. Clement (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 96), St.
Ignatius (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 107), St. Justin (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 140), or St. Polycarp (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span>
108). All we can find is incidents from the life of Jesus, sayings, etc.</p>

<p>That Iren&aelig;us is the author of it is very evident. This learned and pious
forger says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"John, the disciple of the Lord, wrote his Gospel to confute
the doctrine <i>lately</i> taught by Cerinthus, and a great while
before by those called Nicolaitans, a branch of the Gnostics;
and to show that there is one God who made all things by his
WORD: and not, as they say, that there is one the Creator, and
another the Father of our Lord: and one the Son of the
Creator, and another, even the Christ, who descended from
above upon the Son of the Creator, and continued impassible,
and at length returned to his pleroma or fulness."<a name="FNanchor_458:2_2370" id="FNanchor_458:2_2370"></a><a href="#Footnote_458:2_2370" class="fnanchor">[458:2]</a></p></div>

<p>The idea of God having inspired <i>four</i> different men to write a history
of the <i>same transactions</i>,&mdash;or rather, of many <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>different men having
undertaken to write such a history, of whom God inspired <i>four only</i> to
write correctly, leaving the others to their own unaided resources, and
giving us no test by which to distinguish the inspired from the
uninspired&mdash;certainly appears self-confuting, and anything but natural.</p>

<p>The reasons assigned by Iren&aelig;us for <ins class="corr" title="original has their">there</ins> being <i>four</i> Gospels are as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is impossible that there could be more or less than
<i>four</i>. For there are <i>four</i> climates, and <i>four</i> cardinal
winds; but the Gospel is the pillar and foundation of the
church, and its breath of life. <i>The church therefore was to
have four pillars, blowing immortality from every quarter, and
giving life to man.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_459:1_2371" id="FNanchor_459:1_2371"></a><a href="#Footnote_459:1_2371" class="fnanchor">[459:1]</a></p></div>

<p>It was by this Iren&aelig;us, with the assistance of Clement of Alexandria,
and Tertullian, one of the Latin Fathers, that the four Gospels were
introduced into <i>general</i> use among the Christians.</p>

<p>In these four spurious Gospels, and in some which are considered
<i>Apocryphal</i>&mdash;because the bishops at the Council of Laodicea (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 365)
rejected them&mdash;we have the only history of Jesus of Nazareth. Now, if
all accounts or narratives of Christ Jesus and his Apostles were
forgeries, as it is admitted that all the <i>Apocryphal</i> ones were, what
can the superior character of the received Gospels prove for them, but
that they are merely superiorly executed forgeries? The existence of
Jesus is implied in the New Testament outside of the Gospels, <i>but
hardly an incident of his life is mentioned, hardly a sentence that he
spoke has been preserved</i>. Paul, writing from twenty to thirty years
after his death, has but a single reference to anything he ever said or
did.</p>

<p>Beside these four Gospels there were, as we said above, many others,
for, in the words of Mosheim, the ecclesiastical historian:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Not long after Christ's ascension into heaven, several
histories of his life and doctrines, full of <i>pious frauds</i>
and <i>fabulous wonders</i>, were composed by persons whose
intentions, perhaps, were not bad, but whose writings
discovered the greatest superstition and ignorance. Nor was
this all; <i>productions appeared, which were imposed upon the
world by fraudulent men, as the writings of the holy
apostles</i>."<a name="FNanchor_459:2_2372" id="FNanchor_459:2_2372"></a><a href="#Footnote_459:2_2372" class="fnanchor">[459:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Dr. Conyers Middleton, speaking on this subject, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There never was any period of time in all ecclesiastical
history, in which so many rank heresies were publicly
professed, <i>nor in which so many spurious books were forged</i>
and published by the Christians, under the names of Christ,
and the Apostles, and the Apostolic writers, as in those
primitive ages. <i>Several of these forged books are frequently
cited and applied to the defense of Christianity, by the most
eminent fathers of the same ages, as true and genuine
pieces.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_459:3_2373" id="FNanchor_459:3_2373"></a><a href="#Footnote_459:3_2373" class="fnanchor">[459:3]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span></p><p>Archbishop Wake also admits that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It would be useless to insist on all the spurious pieces
which were attributed to St. Paul alone, in the primitive ages
of Christianity."<a name="FNanchor_460:1_2374" id="FNanchor_460:1_2374"></a><a href="#Footnote_460:1_2374" class="fnanchor">[460:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Some of the "spurious pieces which were attributed to St. Paul," may be
found <ins class="corr" title="original has to day">to-day</ins> in our canonical New Testament, and are believed by many to
be the word of God.<a name="FNanchor_460:2_2375" id="FNanchor_460:2_2375"></a><a href="#Footnote_460:2_2375" class="fnanchor">[460:2]</a></p>

<p>The learned Bishop Faustus, in speaking of the authenticity of the <i>New
Testament</i>, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is certain that the New Testament was not written by
Christ himself, nor by his apostles, but a long while after
them, <i>by some unknown persons</i>, who, lest they should not be
credited when they wrote of affairs they were little
acquainted with, affixed to their works the names of the
apostles, or of such as were supposed to have been their
companions, asserting that what they had written themselves,
was written according to these persons to whom they ascribed
it."<a name="FNanchor_460:3_2376" id="FNanchor_460:3_2376"></a><a href="#Footnote_460:3_2376" class="fnanchor">[460:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Again he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Many things have been inserted by our ancestors in the
speeches of our Lord, which, though put forth under his name,
agree not with his faith; especially since&mdash;<i>as already it has
been often proved</i>&mdash;these things were not written by Christ,
nor his apostles, but a long while after their assumption, by
I know not what sort of half Jews, not even agreeing with
themselves, who made up their tale out of reports and opinions
merely, and yet, fathering the whole upon the names of the
apostles of the Lord, or on those who were supposed to follow
the apostles, they mendaciously pretended that they had
written their lies and conceits according to them."<a name="FNanchor_460:4_2377" id="FNanchor_460:4_2377"></a><a href="#Footnote_460:4_2377" class="fnanchor">[460:4]</a></p></div>

<p>What had been said to have been done in <i>India</i>, was said by these
"half-Jews" to have been done in <i>Palestine</i>; the change of names and
places, with the mixing up of various sketches of the Egyptian, Persian,
Phenician, Greek and Roman mythology, was all that was necessary. They
had an abundance of material, and with it they built. The foundation
upon which they built was undoubtedly the "<i>Scriptures</i>," or Diegesis,
of the Essenes in Alexandria in Egypt, which fact led Eusebius, the
ecclesiastical historian&mdash;"without whom," says Tillemont, "we should
scarce have had any knowledge of the history of the first ages of
Christianity, or of the authors who wrote in that time"&mdash;to say that the
sacred writings used by this sect were none other than "<i>Our Gospels</i>."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span></p><p>We offer below a few of the many proofs showing the Gospels to have
been written a long time after the events narrated are said to have
occurred, and by persons unacquainted with the country of which they

<p>"He (Jesus) came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the
coasts of Decapolis," is an assertion made by the Mark narrator (vii.
31), when there were no coasts of Decapolis, nor was the name so much as
known before the reign of the emperor Nero.</p>

<p>Again, "He (Jesus) departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of
Judea, beyond Jordan," is an assertion made by the Matthew narrator
(xix. 1), when the Jordan itself was the eastern boundary of Judea, and
there were no coasts of Judea beyond it.</p>

<p>Again, "But when he (Joseph) heard that Archelaus did reign in Judea, in
the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither,
notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into
the parts of Galilee, and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth;
that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the prophets, he shall
be called a Nazarene," is another assertion made by the Matthew narrator
(ii. 22, 23), when&mdash;1. It was a son of Herod who reigned in Galilee as
well as Judea, so that he could not be more secure in one province than
in the other; and when&mdash;2. It was impossible for him to have gone from
Egypt to Nazareth, without traveling through the whole extent of
Archelaus's kingdom, or making a peregrination through the deserts on
the north and east of the Lake Asphaltites, and the country of Moab; and
then, either crossing the Jordan into Samaria or the Lake of Gennesareth
into Galilee, and from thence going to the city of Nazareth, which is no
better geography, than if one should describe a person as <i>turning
aside</i> from Cheapside into the parts of Yorkshire; and when&mdash;3. There
were no prophets whatever who had prophesied that Jesus "<i>should be
called a Nazarene</i>."</p>

<p>The Matthew narrator (iv. 13) states that "He departed into Galilee, and
leaving Nazareth, came and dwelt in Capernaum," as if he imagined that
the city of Nazareth was not as properly in Galilee as Capernaum was;
which is much such geographical accuracy, as if one should relate the
travels of a hero, who departed into Middlesex, and leaving London, came
and dwelt in Lombard street.<a name="FNanchor_461:1_2378" id="FNanchor_461:1_2378"></a><a href="#Footnote_461:1_2378" class="fnanchor">[461:1]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span></p><p>There are many other falsehoods in gospel geography beside these,
which, it is needless to mention, plainly show that the writers were not
the persons they are generally supposed to be.</p>

<p>Of gospel statistics there are many falsehoods; among them may be
mentioned the following:</p>

<p>"Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto
John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness," is an assertion made by
the Luke narrator (Luke iii. 2); when all Jews, or persons living among
them, must have known that there never was but <i>one</i> high priest at a
time, as with ourselves there is but one mayor of a city.</p>

<p>Again we read (John vii. 52), "Search (the Scriptures) and look, for out
of Galilee ariseth no prophet," when the most distinguished of the
Jewish prophets&mdash;Nahum and Jonah&mdash;were both Galileans.</p>

<p>See reference in the Epistles to "<i>Saints</i>," a religious order, owing
its origin to the popes. Also, references to the distinct orders of
"<i>Bishops</i>," "<i>Priests</i>," and "<i>Deacons</i>," and calls to a monastic life;
to fasting, etc., when, the titles of "Bishop," "Priest," and "Deacon"
were given to the Essenes&mdash;whom Eusebius calls Christians&mdash;and, as is
well known, <i>monasteries</i> were the abode of the Essenes or Therapeuts.</p>

<p>See the words for "<i>legion</i>," "<i>aprons</i>," "<i>handkerchiefs</i>,"
"<i>centurion</i>," etc., in the original, not being Greek, but Latin,
written in Greek characters, a practice first to be found in the
historian Herodian, in the third century.</p>

<p>In Matt. xvi. 18, and Matt. xviii. 17, the word "<i>Church</i>" is used, and
its <i>papistical</i> and infallible authority referred to as then existing,
which is known not to have existed till ages after. And the passage in
Matt. xi. 12:&mdash;"From the days of John the Baptist until <i>now</i>, the
kingdom of heaven suffereth violence," etc., could not have been written
till a very late period.</p>

<p>Luke ii. 1, shows that the writer (whoever he may have been) lived long
after the events related. His dates, about the fifteenth year of
Tiberius, and the government of Cyrenius (the only indications of time
in the New Testament), are manifestly false. The general ignorance of
the four Evangelists, not merely of the geography and statistics of
Judea, but even of its language,&mdash;their egregious blunders, which no
writers who had lived in that age could be conceived of as
making,&mdash;prove that they were not only no such persons as those who have
been willing to be deceived have taken them to be, but that they were
not Jews, had never been in Palestine, and neither lived at, or at
anywhere near the times to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>which their narratives seem to refer. The
ablest divines at the present day, of all denominations, have yielded as
much as this.<a name="FNanchor_463:1_2379" id="FNanchor_463:1_2379"></a><a href="#Footnote_463:1_2379" class="fnanchor">[463:1]</a></p>

<p>The Scriptures were in the hands of the clergy only, and they had every
opportunity to insert whatsoever they pleased; thus we find them full of
<i>interpolations</i>. Johann Solomo Semler, one of the most influential
theologians of the eighteenth century, speaking of this, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Christian doctors never brought their sacred books before
the common people; although people in general have been wont
to think otherwise; during the first ages, they were in the
hands of the clergy only."<a name="FNanchor_463:2_2380" id="FNanchor_463:2_2380"></a><a href="#Footnote_463:2_2380" class="fnanchor">[463:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Concerning the <i>time</i> when the canon of the New Testament was settled,
Mosheim says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The opinions, or rather the <i>conjectures</i>, of the learned
concerning the <i>time</i> when the books of the New Testament were
collected into one volume; as also about the authors of that
collection, are extremely different. This important question
is attended with great and almost insuperable difficulties to
us in these later times."<a name="FNanchor_463:3_2381" id="FNanchor_463:3_2381"></a><a href="#Footnote_463:3_2381" class="fnanchor">[463:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The Rev. B. F. Westcott says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is impossible to point to any period as marking the date
at which our present canon was determined. When it first
appears, it is presented not as a novelty, but as an ancient
tradition."<a name="FNanchor_463:4_2382" id="FNanchor_463:4_2382"></a><a href="#Footnote_463:4_2382" class="fnanchor">[463:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Dr. Lardner says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Even so late as the middle of the <i>sixth century</i>, the canon
of the New Testament had not been settled by any authority
that was decisive and universally <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>acknowledged, but Christian
people were at liberty to judge for themselves concerning the
genuineness of writings proposed to them as apostolical, and
to determine according to evidence."<a name="FNanchor_464:1_2383" id="FNanchor_464:1_2383"></a><a href="#Footnote_464:1_2383" class="fnanchor">[464:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The learned Michaelis says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"No manuscript of the New Testament now extant is prior to the
<i>sixth century</i>, and what is to be lamented, various readings
which, as appears from the quotations of the Fathers, were in
the text of the Greek Testament, are to be found in none of
the manuscripts which are at present remaining."<a name="FNanchor_464:2_2384" id="FNanchor_464:2_2384"></a><a href="#Footnote_464:2_2384" class="fnanchor">[464:2]</a></p></div>

<p>And Bishop Marsh says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is a certain fact, that several readings in our common
printed text are nothing more than <i>alterations</i> made by
Origen, whose authority was so great in the Christian Church
(<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 230) that emendations which he proposed, though, as he
himself acknowledged, they were supported by the evidence of
no manuscript, were very generally received."<a name="FNanchor_464:3_2385" id="FNanchor_464:3_2385"></a><a href="#Footnote_464:3_2385" class="fnanchor">[464:3]</a></p></div>

<p>In his Ecclesiastical History, Eusebius gives us a list of what books at
that time (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 315) were considered canonical. They are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The four-fold writings of the Evangelists," "The Acts of the
Apostles," "The Epistles of Peter," "after these the <i>first</i>
of John, and that of Peter," "<i>All these are received for
undoubted.</i>" "The Revelation of St. John, <i>some disavow</i>."</p>

<p>"The books which are <i>gainsaid</i>, though well known unto many,
are these: the Epistle of James, the Epistle of Jude, the
<i>latter</i> of Peter, the <i>second</i> and <i>third</i> of John, <i>whether
they were John the Evangelist, or some other of the same
name</i>."<a name="FNanchor_464:4_2386" id="FNanchor_464:4_2386"></a><a href="#Footnote_464:4_2386" class="fnanchor">[464:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Though Iren&aelig;us, in the second century, is the first who mentions the
evangelists, and Origen, in the third century, is the first who gives us
a catalogue of the books contained in the New Testament, Mosheim's
admission still stands before us. We have no grounds of assurance that
the mere mention of the <i>names</i> of the evangelists by Iren&aelig;us, or the
arbitrary drawing up of a particular catalogue by Origen, were of any
authority. It is still unknown <i>by whom</i>, or <i>where</i>, or <i>when</i>, the
canon of the New Testament was settled. But in this absence of positive
evidence we have abundance of negative proof. We know when it was <i>not</i>
settled. We know it was not settled in the time of the Emperor
Justinian, nor in the time of Cassiodorus; that is, not at any time
<i>before the middle of the sixth century</i>, "by any authority that was
decisive and universally acknowledged; but Christian people were at
liberty to judge for themselves concerning the <ins class="corr" title="original has genuiness">genuineness</ins> of writings
proposed to them as apostolical."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span></p><p>We cannot do better than close this chapter with the words of Prof. Max
M&uuml;ller, who, in speaking of Buddhism, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We have in the history of Buddhism an excellent opportunity
for watching the process by which a canon of sacred books is
called into existence. We see here, <i>as elsewhere</i>, that
during the life-time of the teacher, no record of events, no
sacred code containing the sayings of the Master, was wanted.
His presence was enough, and thoughts of the future, and more
particularly, of future greatness, seldom entered the minds of
those who followed him. It was only after Buddha had left the
world to enter into <i>Nirv&acirc;na</i>, that his disciples attempted to
recall the sayings and doings of their departed friend and
master. At that time, everything that seemed to redound to the
glory of Buddha, however extraordinary and incredible, was
eagerly welcomed, while witnesses who would have ventured to
criticise or reject unsupported statements, or to detract in
any way from the holy character of Buddha, had no chance of
ever being listened to. And when, in spite of all this,
differences of opinion arose, they were not brought to the
test by a careful weighing of evidence, but the names of
'<i>unbeliever</i>' and '<i>heretic</i>' were quickly invented in India
<i>as elsewhere</i>, and bandied backwards and forwards between
contending parties, till at last, when the doctors disagreed,
the help of the secular power had to be invoked, and kings and
emperors assembled councils for the suppression of schism, for
the settlement of an orthodox creed, and for the completion of
a <i>sacred canon</i>."<a name="FNanchor_465:1_2387" id="FNanchor_465:1_2387"></a><a href="#Footnote_465:1_2387" class="fnanchor">[465:1]</a></p></div>

<p>That which Prof. M&uuml;ller describes as taking place in the religion of
Christ Buddha, is exactly what took place in the religion of Christ
Jesus. That the miraculous, and many of the non-miraculous, events
related in the Gospels never happened, is demonstrable from the facts
which we have seen in this work, that nearly all of these events, had
been previously related of the gods and goddesses of heathen nations of
antiquity, more especially of the Hindoo Saviour <i>Crishna</i>, and the
Buddhist Saviour <i>Buddha</i>, whose religion, with less alterations than
time and translations have made in the Jewish Scriptures, may be traced
in nearly every dogma and every ceremony of the evangelical mythology.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The <i>Codex Sinaiticus</i>, referred to on the preceding page,
(<a href="#Footnote_464:2_2384"><i>note</i> 2</a>,) was found at the Convent of St. Catherine on Mt. Sinai, by
Tischendorf, in 1859. He <i>supposes</i> that it belongs to the 4th cent.;
but Dr. Davidson (in Kitto's Bib. Ency., Art. MSS.) thinks different. He
says: "<i>Probably</i> it is of the 6th <i>cent.</i>," while he states that the
<i>Codex Vaticanus</i> "is <i>believed</i> to belong to the 4th cent.," and the
<i>Codex</i> Alexandrinus to the 5th cent. McClintock &amp; Strong's Ency. (Art.
MSS.,) relying probably on Tischendorf's conjecture, places the <i>Codex
Sinaiticus</i> first. "It is <i>probably</i> the oldest of the MSS. of the N.
T., and of the 4th cent.," say they. The <i>Codex Vaticanus</i> is considered
the next oldest, and the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i> is placed third in order,
and "was <i>probably</i> written in the first half of the 5th cent." The
writer of the art. N. T. in Smith's <i>Bib. Dic.</i> says: "The <i>Codex
Sinaiticus</i> is probably the oldest of the MSS. of the N. T., and of the
4th cent.;" and that the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i> "was <i>probably</i> written in
the first half of the 5th cent." Thus we see that in determining the
dates of the MSS. of the N. T., Christian divines are obliged to resort
to <i>conjecture</i>; there being no certainty whatever in the matter. But
with all their "suppositions," "probabilities," "beliefs" and
"conjectures," we have the words of the learned Michaelis still before
us, that: "No MSS. of the N. T. now extant are prior to the <i>sixth
cent.</i>" This remark, however, does not cover the <i>Codex Sinaiticus</i>,
which was discovered since Michaelis wrote his work on the N. T.; but,
as we saw above, Dr. Davidson does not agree with Tischendorf in regard
to its antiquity, and places it in the 6th cent.</p>

Japan, from Ceylon and Siam to the borders of Mongolia and Siberia. Like
his Christian prototype Constantine, he was converted by a miracle.
After his conversion, which took place in the tenth year of his reign,
he became a very zealous supporter of the new religion. He himself built
many monasteries and dagabas, and provided many <i>monks</i> with the

native land by the Mohammedan conquerors under the Khalif Omar, in the
seventh century of our era. Adhering to the ancient religion of Persia,
which resembles that of the <i>Veda</i>, and bringing with them the records
of their faith, the <i>Zend-Avesta</i> of their prophet Zoroaster, they
settled down in the neighborhood of Surat, about one thousand one
hundred years ago, and became great merchants and shipbuilders. For two
or three centuries we know little of their history. Their religion
prevented them from making proselytes, and they never multiplied within
themselves to any extent, nor did they amalgamate with the Hindoo
population, so that even now their number only amounts to about seventy
thousand. Nevertheless, from their busy, enterprising habits, in which
they emulate Europeans, they form an important section of the population
of Bombay and Western India.</p></div>

contrast as that already indicated on turning from the <i>Macbeth</i> or
<i>Othello</i> of Shakespeare to the <i>Comus</i> of Milton or to Spenser's
<i>Faerie Queene</i>." (Francis Tiffany.)</p>

<p>"To learn how far we may trust them (the Gospels) we must in the first
place compare them with each other. The moment we do so we notice that
the <i>fourth</i> stands quite alone, while the <i>first three form a single
group</i>, not only following the same general course, but sometimes even
showing a verbal agreement which cannot possibly be accidental." (The
Bible for Learners, vol. ii. p. 27.)</p></div>

external evidence points to the conclusion <i>that the synoptic gospels
are non-apostolic digests of spoken and written</i> apostolic tradition,
and that the arrangement of the earlier material in orderly form took
place only gradually and by many essays."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Hooykaas</i>, speaking of the four "Gospels," and "Acts," says of
them: "Not one of these five books was really written by the person
whose name it bears, and they are all of more recent date than the
heading would lead us to suppose."
</p>

<p>"We cannot say that the "Gospels" and book of "Acts" are <i>unauthentic</i>,
for not one of them professes to give the name of its author. <i>They
appeared anonymously.</i> The titles placed above them in our Bibles owe
their origin to a later ecclesiastical tradition which deserves no
confidence whatever." (Bible for Learners, vol. iii. pp. 24, 25.)
</p>

<p>These Gospels "can hardly be said to have had authors at all. <i>They had
only editors or compilers.</i> What I mean is, that those who enriched the
old Christian literature with these Gospels did not go to work as
independent writers and compose their own narratives out of the accounts
they had collected, but simply took up the different stories or sets of
stories which they found current in the <i>oral</i> tradition or already
reduced to writing, <i>adding here</i> and <i>expanding there</i>, and so sent out
into the world a very artless kind of composition. These works were
then, from time to time, somewhat enriched by <i>introductory matter or
interpolations</i> from the hands of later Christians, and perhaps were
modified a little here and there. Our first two Gospels appear to have
passed through more than one such revision. The third, whose writer says
in his preface, that 'many had undertaken to put together a narrative
(Gospel),' before him, appears to proceed from a single collecting,
arranging, and modifying hand." (Ibid. p. 29.)</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

<h3>EXPLANATION.</h3>

<p>After what we have seen concerning the numerous virgin-born, crucified
and resurrected Saviours, believed on in the Pagan world for so many
centuries before the time assigned for the birth of the Christian
Saviour, the questions naturally arise: were they real personages? did
they ever exist in the flesh? whence came these stories concerning them?
have they a foundation in truth, or are they simply creations of the
imagination?</p>

<p>The <i>historical</i> theory&mdash;according to which <i>all</i> the persons mentioned
in mythology were once real human beings, and the legends and fabulous
traditions relating to them were merely the additions and embellishments
of later times&mdash;which was so popular with scholars of the last century,
has been altogether abandoned.</p>

<p>Under the historical point of view the gods are mere deified mortals,
either heroes who have been deified after their death, or
Pontiff-chieftains who have passed themselves off for gods, and who, it
is gratuitously supposed, found people stupid enough to believe in their
pretended divinity. This was the manner in which, formerly, writers
explained the mythology of nations of antiquity; but a method that
pre-supposed an historical Crishna, an historical Osiris, an historical
Mithra, an historical Hercules, an historical Apollo, or an historical
Thor, was found untenable, and therefore, does not, at the present day,
stand in need of a refutation. As a writer of the early part of the
present century said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We shall never have an ancient history worthy of the perusal
of men of common sense, till we cease treating poems as
history, and send back such personages as Hercules, Theseus,
Bacchus, etc., to the heavens, whence their history is taken,
and whence they never descended to the earth."</p></div>

<p>The historical theory was succeeded by the <i>allegorical</i> theory, which
supposes that all the myths of the ancients were <i>allegorical</i> and
<i>symbolical</i>, and contain some moral, religious, or philosophical <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>truth
or historical fact under the form of an allegory, which came in process
of time to be understood literally.</p>

<p>In the preceding pages we have spoken of the several virgin-born,
crucified and resurrected Saviours, as real personages. We have
attributed to these individuals words and acts, and have regarded the
words and acts recorded in the several sacred books from which we have
quoted, as said and done by them. But in doing this, we have simply used
the language of others. These gods and heroes were not real personages;
<i>they are merely personifications of the</i> <span class="smcap">Sun</span>. As Prof. Max M&uuml;ller
observes in his Lectures on the Science of Religion:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"One of the earliest objects that would strike and stir the
mind of man, and for which a <i>sign</i> or a <i>name</i> would soon be
wanted, is surely the <i>Sun</i>.<a name="FNanchor_467:1_2388" id="FNanchor_467:1_2388"></a><a href="#Footnote_467:1_2388" class="fnanchor">[467:1]</a> It is very hard for us to
realize the feelings with which the first dwellers on the
earth looked upon the Sun, or to understand fully what they
meant by a morning prayer or a morning sacrifice. Perhaps
there are few people who have watched a sunrise more than once
or twice in their life; few people who have ever known the
meaning of a morning prayer, or a morning sacrifice. But think
of man at the very dawn of time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. think of the Sun awakening
the eyes of man from sleep, and his mind from slumber! Was not
the sunrise to him the first wonder, the first beginning of
all reflection, all thought, all philosophy? Was it not to him
the first revelation, the first beginning of all trust, of all
religion? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Few nations only have preserved in their ancient poetry some
remnants of the natural awe with which the earlier dwellers on
the earth saw that brilliant being slowly rising from out of
the darkness of the night, raising itself by its own might
higher and higher, till it stood triumphant on the arch of
heaven, and then descended and sank down in its fiery glory
into the dark abyss of the heaving and hissing sea. In the
hymns of the <i>Veda</i>, the poet still wonders whether the Sun
will rise again; he asks how he can climb the vault of heaven?
why he does not fall back? why there is no dust on his path?
And when the rays of the morning rouse him from sleep and call
him back to new life, when he sees the Sun, as he says,
stretching out his golden arms to bless the world and rescue
it from the terror of darkness, he exclaims, 'Arise, our life,
our spirit has come back! the darkness is gone, the light
approaches.<ins class="corr" title="single quote missing in original">'"</ins></p></div>

<p>Many years ago, the learned Sir William Jones said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We must not be surprised at finding, on a close examination,
that the characters of all the Pagan deities, male and female,
melt into each other, and at last into one or two; for it
seems as well founded opinion, that the whole crowd of gods
and goddesses of ancient Rome, and modern Var&#257;nes, mean
only the powers of nature, and principally those of the SUN,
expressed in a variety of ways, and by a multitude of fanciful
names."<a name="FNanchor_467:2_2389" id="FNanchor_467:2_2389"></a><a href="#Footnote_467:2_2389" class="fnanchor">[467:2]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p><p>Since the first learned president of the Royal Asiatic Society paved
the way for the science of <i>comparative mythology</i>, much has been
learned on this subject, so that, as the Rev. George W. Cox remarks,
"recent discussions on the subject seem to justify the conviction that
the foundations of the science of <i>comparative mythology</i> have been
firmly laid, and that its method is unassailable."<a name="FNanchor_468:1_2390" id="FNanchor_468:1_2390"></a><a href="#Footnote_468:1_2390" class="fnanchor">[468:1]</a></p>

<p>If we wish to find the gods and goddesses of the ancestors of our race,
we must look to the sun, the moon, the stars, the sky, the earth, the
sea, the dawn, the clouds, the wind, &amp;c., <i>which they personified and
worshiped</i>. That these have been the gods and goddesses of all nations
of antiquity, is an established fact.<a name="FNanchor_468:2_2391" id="FNanchor_468:2_2391"></a><a href="#Footnote_468:2_2391" class="fnanchor">[468:2]</a></p>

<p>The words which had denoted the sun and moon would denote not merely
living things but living persons. From personification to deification
the steps would be but few; and the process of disintegration would at
once furnish the materials for a vast fabric of mythology. All the
expressions which had attached a living force to natural objects would
remain as the description of personal and anthropomorphous gods. Every
word would become an attribute, and all ideas, once grouped around a
simple object, would branch off into distinct personifications. The sun
had been the lord of light, the driver of the chariot of the day; he had
toiled and labored for the sons of men, and sunk down to rest, after a
hard battle, in the evening. But now the lord of light would be Phoibos
Apollon, while Helios would remain enthroned in his fiery chariot, and
his toils and labors and death-struggles would be transferred to
Hercules. The violet clouds which greet his rising and his setting would
now be represented by herds of cows which feed in earthly pastures.
There would be other expressions which would still remain as floating
phrases, not attached to any definite deities. These would gradually be
converted into incidents in the life of heroes, and be woven at length
into systematic narratives. Finally, these gods or heroes, and the
incidents of their mythical career, would receive each "a local
habitation and a name." <i>These would remain as genuine history, when the
origin and meaning of the words had been either wholly or in part
forgotten.</i></p>

<p>For the proofs of these assertions, the Vedic poems furnish indisputable
evidence, that such as this was the origin and growth of Greek and
Teutonic mythology. In these poems, the names of many, perhaps of most,
of the Greek gods, indicate natural objects which, if endued with life,
have not been reduced to human <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>personality. In them Daphne is still
simply the morning twilight ushering in the splendor of the new born
sun; the cattle of Helios there are still the light-colored clouds which
the dawn leads out into the fields of the sky. There the idea of
Hercules has not been separated from the image of the toiling and
struggling sun, and the glory of the life-giving Helios has not been
transferred to the god of Delos and Pytho. In the Vedas the myths of
Endymion, of Kephalos and Prokris, Orpheus and Eurydike, are exhibited
in the form of detached mythical phrases, which furnished for each their
germ. The analysis may be extended indefinitely: but the conclusion can
only be, that in the Vedic language we have the foundation, not only of
the glowing legends of Hellas, but of the dark and sombre mythology of
the Scandinavian and the Teuton. Both alike have grown up chiefly from
names which have been grouped around the sun; but the former has been
grounded on those expressions which describe the recurrence of day and
night, the latter on the great tragedy of nature, in the alternation of
summer and winter.</p>

<p>Of this vast mass of solar myths, some have emerged into independent
legends, others have furnished the groundwork of whole epics, others
have remained simply as floating tales whose intrinsic beauty no poet
has wedded to his verse.<a name="FNanchor_469:1_2392" id="FNanchor_469:1_2392"></a><a href="#Footnote_469:1_2392" class="fnanchor">[469:1]</a></p>

<p>"The results obtained from the examination of language in its several
forms leaves no room for doubt that the general system of mythology has
been traced to its fountain head. We can no longer shut our eyes to the
fact that there was a stage in the history of human speech, during which
all the abstract words in constant use among ourselves were utterly
unknown, when men had formed no notions of virtue or prudence, of
thought and intellect, of slavery or freedom, but spoke only of the man
who was strong, who could point the way to others and choose one thing
out of many, of the man who was not bound to any other and able to do as
he pleased.</p>

<p>"That even this stage was not the earliest in the history of language is
now a growing opinion among philologists; but for the <i>comparison</i> of
legends current in different countries it is not necessary to carry the
search further back. Language without words denoting abstract qualities
implies a condition of thought in which men were only awakening to a
sense of the objects which surrounded them, and points to a time when
the world was to them full of strange sights and sounds, some beautiful,
some bewildering, some terrific, when, in short, they knew little of
themselves beyond <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>the vague consciousness of their existence, and
nothing of the phenomena of the world without. <i>In such a state they
could but attribute to all that they saw or touched or heard, a life
which was like their own in its consciousness, its joys, and its
sufferings.</i> That power of sympathizing with nature which we are apt to
regard as the peculiar gift of the poet was then shared alike by all.
This sympathy was not the result of any effort, it was inseparably bound
up with the words which rose to their lips. It implied no special purity
of heart or mind; it pointed to no Arcadian paradise where shepherds
knew not how to wrong or oppress or torment each other. We say that the
morning light rests on the mountains; they said that the sun was
greeting his bride, as naturally as our own poet would speak of the
sunlight clasping the earth, or the moonbeams as kissing the sea.</p>

<p>"We have then before us a stage of language corresponding to a stage in
the history of the human mind <i>in which all sensible objects were
regarded as instinct with a conscious life</i>. The varying phases of that
life were therefore described as truthfully as they described their own
feelings or sufferings; and hence every phase became a picture. But so
long as the conditions of their life remained unchanged, they knew
perfectly what the picture meant, and ran no risk of confusing one with
another. Thus they had but to describe the things which they saw, felt,
or heard, in order to keep up an inexhaustible store of phrases
faithfully describing the facts of the world from their point of view.
This language was indeed the result of an observation not less keen than
that by which the inductive philosopher extorts the secrets of the
natural world. Nor was its range much narrower. Each object received its
own measure of attention, and no one phenomenon was so treated as to
leave no room for others in their turn. They could not fail to note the
changes of days and years, of growth and decay, of calm and storm; <i>but
the objects which so changed were to them living things, and the rising
and setting of the sun, the return of winter and summer, became a drama
in which the actors were their enemies or their friends</i>.</p>

<p>"That this is a strict statement of facts in the history of the human
mind, philology alone would abundantly prove; but not a few of these
phrases have come down to us in their earliest form, and point to the
long-buried stratum of language of which they are the fragments. <i>These
relics exhibit in their germs the myths which afterwards became the
legends of gods and heroes with human <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>forms, and furnished the
groundwork of the epic poems, whether of the eastern or the western
world.</i></p>

<p>"The mythical or mythmaking language of mankind had no partialities; and
if the career of the <i>Sun</i> occupies a large extent of the horizon, we
cannot fairly simulate ignorance of the cause. Men so placed would not
fail to put into words the thoughts or emotions roused in them by the
varying phases of that mighty world on which we, not less than they,
feel that our life depends, although we may know something more of its
nature.</p>

<p>"Thus grew up a multitude of expressions which described the sun as the
child of the night, as the destroyer of the darkness, as the lover of
the dawn and the dew&mdash;of phrases which would go on to speak of him as
killing the dew with his spears, and of forsaking the dawn as he rose in
the heaven. The feeling that the fruits of the earth were called forth
by his warmth would find utterance in words which spoke of him as the
friend and the benefactor of man; while the constant recurrence of his
work would lead them to describe him as a being constrained to toil for
others, as doomed to travel over many lands, and as finding everywhere
things on which he could bestow his love or which he might destroy by
his power. His journey, again, might be across cloudless skies, or amid
alternations of storm and calm; his light might break fitfully through
the clouds, or be hidden for many a weary hour, to burst forth at last
with dazzling splendor as he sank down in the western sky. He would thus
be described as facing many dangers and many enemies, none of whom,
however, may arrest his course; as sullen, or capricious, or resentful;
as grieving for the loss of the dawn whom he had loved, or as nursing
his great wrath and vowing a pitiless vengeance. Then as the veil was
rent at eventide, they would speak of the chief, who had long remained
still, girding on his armor; or of the wanderer throwing off his
disguise, and seizing his bow or spear to smite his enemies; of the
invincible warrior whose face gleams with the flush of victory when the
fight is over, as he greets the fair-haired Dawn who closes, as she had
begun, the day. To the wealth of images thus lavished on the daily life
and death of the Sun there would be no limit. He was the child of the
morning, or her husband, or her destroyer; he forsook her and he
returned to her, either in calm serenity or only to sink presently in
deeper gloom.</p>

<p>"So with other sights and sounds. The darkness of night brought with it
a feeling of vague horror and dread; the return of daylight cheered them
with a sense of unspeakable gladness; and thus the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>Sun who scattered
the black shade of night would be the mighty champion doing battle with
the biting snake which lurked in its dreary hiding-place. But as the Sun
accomplishes his journey day by day through the heaven, the character of
the seasons is changed. The buds and blossoms of spring-time expand in
the flowers and fruits of summer, and the leaves fall and wither on the
approach of winter. Thus the daughter of the earth would be spoken of as
dying or as dead, as severed from her mother for five or six weary
months, not to be restored to her again until the time for her return
from the dark land should once more arrive. But as no other power than
that of the Sun can recall vegetation to life, this child of the earth
would be represented as buried in a sleep from which the touch of the
Sun alone could arouse her, when he slays the frost and cold which lie
like snakes around her motionless form.</p>

<p>"<i>That these phrases would furnish the germs of myths or legends teeming
with human feeling, as soon as the meaning of the phrases were in part
or wholly forgotten, was as inevitable as that in the infancy of our
race men should attribute to all sensible objects the same kind of life
which they were conscious of possessing themselves.</i>"</p>

<p>Let us compare the history of the <i>Saviour</i> which we have already seen,
with that of the <i>Sun</i>, as it is found in the <i>Vedas</i>.</p>

<p>We can follow in the <i>Vedic</i> hymns, step by step, the development which
changes the <i>Sun</i> from a mere luminary into a "<i>Creator</i>,"
"<i>Preserver</i>," "<i>Ruler</i>," and "<i>Rewarder of the World</i>"&mdash;in fact, into a
<i>Divine or Supreme Being</i>.</p>

<p>The first step leads us from the mere light of the Sun to that light
which in the morning wakes man from sleep, and seems to give new life,
not only to man, but to the whole of nature. He who wakes us in the
morning, who recalls all nature to new life, is soon called "<i>The Giver
of Daily Life</i>."</p>

<p>Secondly, by another and bolder step, the Giver of Daily Light and Life
becomes the giver of light and life in general. <i>He who brings light and
life to-day, is the same who brought light and life on the first of
days.</i> As light is the beginning of the day, so light was the beginning
of creation, and the Sun, from being a mere light-bringer or life-giver,
becomes a Creator, and, if a Creator, then soon also a Ruler of the
World.</p>

<p>Thirdly, as driving away the dreaded darkness of the night, and likewise
as fertilizing the earth, the Sun is conceived as a "Defender" and kind
"Protector" of all living things.</p>

<p>Fourthly, the Sun sees everything, both that which is good and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>that
which is evil; and how natural therefore that the evil-doer should be
told that the sun sees what no human eye may have seen, and that the
innocent, when all other help fails him, should appeal to the sun to
attest his guiltlessness!</p>

<p>Let us examine now, says Prof. M&uuml;ller, from whose work we have quoted
the above, a few passages (from the <i>Rig-Veda</i>) illustrating every one
of these perfectly natural transitions.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In hymn vii. we find the Sun invoked as '<i>The Protector of
everything that moves or stands, of all that exists</i>.'"</p>

<p>"Frequent allusion is made to the Sun's power of seeing
everything. The stars flee before the all-seeing Sun, like
thieves (R. V. vii.). He sees the right and the wrong among
men (Ibid.). He who looks upon the world, knows also all the
thoughts in men (Ibid.)."</p>

<p>"As the Sun sees everything and knows everything, he is asked
to forget and forgive what he alone has seen and knows (R. V.
iv.)."</p>

<p>"The Sun is asked to drive away illness and bad dreams (R. V.
x.)."</p>

<p>"Having once, and more than once, been invoked as the
life-bringer, the Sun is also called the breath or life of all
that moves and rests (R. V. i.); and lastly, he becomes <i>the
maker of all things</i>, by whom all the worlds have been brought
together (R. V. x.), and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lord of man and of all living
creatures."</p>

<p>"He is the God among gods (R. V. i.); he is the divine leader
of all the gods (R. V. viii.)."</p>

<p>"He alone rules the whole world (R. V. v.). The laws which he
has established are firm (R. V. iv.), and the other gods not
only praise him (R. V. vii.), but have to follow him as their
leader (R. V. v.)."<a name="FNanchor_473:1_2393" id="FNanchor_473:1_2393"></a><a href="#Footnote_473:1_2393" class="fnanchor">[473:1]</a></p></div>

<p>That the history of <i>Christ</i> Jesus, the Christian Saviour,&mdash;"the true
<i>Light</i>, which lighteth every man that cometh into the
world,"<a name="FNanchor_473:2_2394" id="FNanchor_473:2_2394"></a><a href="#Footnote_473:2_2394" class="fnanchor">[473:2]</a>&mdash;is simply the history of the <i>Sun</i>&mdash;the real Saviour of
mankind&mdash;is demonstrated beyond a doubt from the following indisputable
facts:</p>

<p>1. <i>The birth of Christ Jesus</i> is said to have taken place at <i>early
dawn</i><a name="FNanchor_473:3_2395" id="FNanchor_473:3_2395"></a><a href="#Footnote_473:3_2395" class="fnanchor">[473:3]</a> on the 25th day of December. Now, this is the <i>Sun's
birthday</i>. At the commencement of the sun's apparent annual revolution
round the earth, he was said to have been born, and, on the first moment
after midnight of the 24th of December, all the heathen nations of the
earth, as if by common consent, celebrated the accouchement of the
"<i>Queen of Heaven</i>," of the "<i>Celestial Virgin of the Sphere</i>," and the
birth of the god <i>Sol</i>. On that day the sun having fully entered the
winter solstice, the <i>Sign of the Virgin</i> was rising on the eastern
horizon. The woman's symbol of this stellar sign was represented first
by ears of corn, then with a new-born male child in her arms. Such was
the picture of the <i>Persian</i> sphere cited by Aben-Ezra:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"The division of the first decan of the Virgin represents a
beautiful virgin with flowing hair, sitting in a chair, with
two ears of corn in her hand, and suckling an infant called
<span class="smcap">Iesus</span> by some nations, and <i>Christ</i> in Greek."<a name="FNanchor_474:1_2396" id="FNanchor_474:1_2396"></a><a href="#Footnote_474:1_2396" class="fnanchor">[474:1]</a></p></div>

<p>This denotes the <i>Sun</i>, which, at the moment of the winter solstice,
precisely when the Persian magi drew the horoscope of the new year, was
placed on the bosom of the Virgin, rising heliacally in the eastern
horizon. On this account he was figured in their astronomical pictures
under the form of a child suckled by a chaste virgin.<a name="FNanchor_474:2_2397" id="FNanchor_474:2_2397"></a><a href="#Footnote_474:2_2397" class="fnanchor">[474:2]</a></p>

<p>Thus we see that Christ Jesus was born on the same day as Buddha,
Mithras, Osiris, Horus, Hercules, Bacchus, Adonis and other
<i>personifications of the</i> <span class="smcap">Sun</span>.<a name="FNanchor_474:3_2398" id="FNanchor_474:3_2398"></a><a href="#Footnote_474:3_2398" class="fnanchor">[474:3]</a></p>

<p>2. <i>Christ Jesus was born of a Virgin.</i> In this respect he is also the
<i>Sun</i>, for 'tis the sun alone who can be born of an immaculate virgin,
who conceived him without carnal intercourse, and who is still, after
the birth of her child, a virgin.</p>

<p>This Virgin, of whom the Sun, the true "Saviour of Mankind," is born, is
either the bright and beautiful <i>Dawn</i>,<a name="FNanchor_474:4_2399" id="FNanchor_474:4_2399"></a><a href="#Footnote_474:4_2399" class="fnanchor">[474:4]</a> or the dark
<i>Earth</i>,<a name="FNanchor_474:5_2400" id="FNanchor_474:5_2400"></a><a href="#Footnote_474:5_2400" class="fnanchor">[474:5]</a> or <i>Night</i>.<a name="FNanchor_474:6_2401" id="FNanchor_474:6_2401"></a><a href="#Footnote_474:6_2401" class="fnanchor">[474:6]</a> Hence we have, as we have already
seen, the <i>Virgin</i>, or <i>Virgo</i>, as one of the signs of the
zodiac.<a name="FNanchor_474:7_2402" id="FNanchor_474:7_2402"></a><a href="#Footnote_474:7_2402" class="fnanchor">[474:7]</a></p>

<p>This Celestial Virgin was feigned to be a mother. She is represented in
the Indian Zodiac of Sir William Jones, with ears of corn in one hand,
and the lotus in the other. In Kircher's Zodiac of Hermes, she has corn
in both hands. In other planispheres of the Egyptian priests she carries
ears of corn in one hand, and the infant Saviour <i>Horus</i> in the other.
In Roman Catholic countries, she is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>generally represented with the
child in one hand, and the lotus or lily in the other. In Vol. II. of
Montfaucon's work, she is represented as a female nursing a child, with
ears of corn in her hand, and the legend <span class="allcapsc">IAO</span>. She is seated on clouds, a
star is at her head. The reading of the Greek letters, from right to
left, show this to be very ancient.</p>

<p>In the Vedic hymns Aditi, <i>the Dawn</i>, is called the "<i>Mother of the
Gods</i>." "She is the mother with powerful, terrible, with <i>royal sons</i>."
She is said to have given birth to the <i>Sun</i>.<a name="FNanchor_475:1_2403" id="FNanchor_475:1_2403"></a><a href="#Footnote_475:1_2403" class="fnanchor">[475:1]</a> "As the <i>Sun</i> and
all the <i>solar deities</i> rise from the <i>east</i>," says Prof. Max M&uuml;ller,
"we can well understand how Aditi (the Dawn) came to be called the
'Mother of the Bright Gods.'"<a name="FNanchor_475:2_2404" id="FNanchor_475:2_2404"></a><a href="#Footnote_475:2_2404" class="fnanchor">[475:2]</a></p>

<p>The poets of the Veda indulged freely in theogonic speculations without
being frightened by any contradictions. They knew of Indra as the
greatest of gods, they knew of Agni as the god of gods, they knew of
Varuna as the ruler of all; but they were by no means startled at the
idea that their Indra had a mother, or that Varuna was nursed in the lap
of Aditi. All this was true to nature; for their god was the <i>Sun</i>, and
the mother who bore and nursed him was the <i>Dawn</i>.<a name="FNanchor_475:3_2405" id="FNanchor_475:3_2405"></a><a href="#Footnote_475:3_2405" class="fnanchor">[475:3]</a></p>

<p>We find in the <i>Vishnu Purana</i>, that Devaki (the virgin mother of the
Hindoo Saviour Crishna, whose history, as we have seen, corresponds in
most every particular with that of Christ Jesus) <i>is called
Aditi</i>,<a name="FNanchor_475:4_2406" id="FNanchor_475:4_2406"></a><a href="#Footnote_475:4_2406" class="fnanchor">[475:4]</a> which, in the <i>Rig-Veda</i>, is the name for the <i>Dawn</i>.
Thus we see the legend is complete. Devaki is Aditi, Aditi is the Dawn,
and the Dawn is the Virgin Mother. "The Saviour of Mankind" who is born
of her is the Sun, the Sun is Crishna, and Crishna is Christ.</p>

<p>In the <i>Mahabharata</i>, Crishna is also represented as the "Son of
<i>Aditi</i>."<a name="FNanchor_475:5_2407" id="FNanchor_475:5_2407"></a><a href="#Footnote_475:5_2407" class="fnanchor">[475:5]</a> As the hour of his birth grew near, the mother became
more beautiful, and her form more brilliant.<a name="FNanchor_475:6_2408" id="FNanchor_475:6_2408"></a><a href="#Footnote_475:6_2408" class="fnanchor">[475:6]</a></p>

<p><i>Indra</i>, the sun, who was worshiped in some parts of India as a
<i>Crucified God</i>, is also represented in the Vedic hymns as the <i>Son of
the Dawn</i>. He is said to have been born of Dahana, who is Daphne, a
personification of the Dawn.<a name="FNanchor_475:7_2409" id="FNanchor_475:7_2409"></a><a href="#Footnote_475:7_2409" class="fnanchor">[475:7]</a></p>

<p>The <i>humanity</i> of this <span class="allcapsc">SOLAR GOD-MAN</span>, this demiurge, is strongly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>insisted on in the <i>Rig-Veda</i>. He is the son of God, but also the son
of Aditi. He is Purusha, the man, the male. Agni is frequently called
the "Son of man." It is expressly explained that the titles Agni, Indra,
Mitra, &amp;c., all refer to <i>one Sun god</i> under "many names." And when we
find the name of a mortal, <i>Yama</i>, who once lived upon earth, included
among these names, the humanity of the demiurge becomes still more
accentuated, and we get at the root idea.</p>

<p><i>Horus</i>, the Egyptian Saviour, was the son of the virgin <i>Isis</i>. Now,
this Isis, in Egyptian mythology, is the same as the virgin Devaki in
Hindoo mythology. She is the <i>Dawn</i>.<a name="FNanchor_476:1_2410" id="FNanchor_476:1_2410"></a><a href="#Footnote_476:1_2410" class="fnanchor">[476:1]</a> <i>Isis</i>, as we have already
seen, is represented suckling the infant Horus, and, in the words of
Prof. Renouf, we may say, "in whose lap can the <i>Sun</i> be nursed more
fitly than in that of the <i>Dawn</i>?"<a name="FNanchor_476:2_2411" id="FNanchor_476:2_2411"></a><a href="#Footnote_476:2_2411" class="fnanchor">[476:2]</a></p>

<p>Among the goddesses of Egypt, the highest was Neith, who reigned
inseparably with Amun in the upper sphere. She was called "Mother of the
gods," "Mother of the sun." She was the feminine origin of all things,
as Amun was the male origin. She held the same rank at Sais as Amun did
at Thebes. Her temples there are said to have exceeded in colossal
grandeur anything ever seen before. On one of these was the celebrated
inscription thus deciphered by Champollion:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am all that has been, all that is, all that will be. No
mortal has ever raised the veil that conceals me. <i>My
offspring is the Sun.</i>"</p></div>

<p>She was mother of the <i>Sun</i>-god <i>Ra</i>, and, says Prof. Renouf, "is
commonly supposed to represent <i>Heaven</i>; but some expressions which are
hardly applicable to heaven, render it more probable that she is one of
the many names of the <i>Dawn</i>."<a name="FNanchor_476:3_2412" id="FNanchor_476:3_2412"></a><a href="#Footnote_476:3_2412" class="fnanchor">[476:3]</a></p>

<p>If we turn from Indian and Egyptian, to Grecian mythology, we shall also
find that their <i>Sun-gods</i> and <i>solar heroes</i> are born of the same
virgin mother. Theseus was said to have been born of Aithra, "<i>the pure
air</i>," and &OElig;dipus of Iokaste, "<i>the violet light of morning</i>."
Perseus was born of the virgin Danae, and was called the "<i>Son of the
bright morning</i>."<a name="FNanchor_476:4_2413" id="FNanchor_476:4_2413"></a><a href="#Footnote_476:4_2413" class="fnanchor">[476:4]</a> In I&ocirc;, the mother of the "sacred bull,"<a name="FNanchor_476:5_2414" id="FNanchor_476:5_2414"></a><a href="#Footnote_476:5_2414" class="fnanchor">[476:5]</a>
the mother also of Hercules, we see the <i>violet-tinted morning</i> from
which the sun is born; all these gods and heroes being, like <i>Christ</i>
Jesus, <i>personifications of the Sun</i>.<a name="FNanchor_476:6_2415" id="FNanchor_476:6_2415"></a><a href="#Footnote_476:6_2415" class="fnanchor">[476:6]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span></p><p>"The Saviour of Mankind" was also represented as being born of the
"<i>dusky mother</i>," which accounts for many Pagan, and so-called
Christian, goddesses being represented <i>black</i>.<a name="FNanchor_477:1_2416" id="FNanchor_477:1_2416"></a><a href="#Footnote_477:1_2416" class="fnanchor">[477:1]</a> This is the <i>dark
night</i>, who for many weary hours travails with the birth of her child.
The Sun, which scatters the darkness, is also the child of the darkness,
and so the phrase naturally went <i>that he was born of her</i>. Of the two
legends related in the poems afterwards combined in the "Hymn to
Apollo," the former relates the birth of Apollo, the <i>Sun</i>, from Leto,
the <i>Darkness</i>, which is called his mother.<a name="FNanchor_477:2_2417" id="FNanchor_477:2_2417"></a><a href="#Footnote_477:2_2417" class="fnanchor">[477:2]</a> In this case, Leto
would be <i>personified</i> as a "black virgin," either with or without the
child in her arms.</p>

<p>The <i>dark earth</i> was also represented as being the mother of the god
Sun, who apparently came out of, or was born of her, in the East,<a name="FNanchor_477:3_2418" id="FNanchor_477:3_2418"></a><a href="#Footnote_477:3_2418" class="fnanchor">[477:3]</a>
as Minos (the sun) was represented to have been born of Ida (the
earth).<a name="FNanchor_477:4_2419" id="FNanchor_477:4_2419"></a><a href="#Footnote_477:4_2419" class="fnanchor">[477:4]</a></p>

<p>In Hindoo mythology, the <i>Earth</i>, under the name of <i>Prithivi</i>, receives
a certain share of honors as one of the primitive goddesses of the Veda,
being thought of as the "<i>kind mother</i>." Moreover, various <i>deities</i>
were regarded as the progeny resulting from the fancied union of the
Earth with Dyaus (<i>Heaven</i>).<a name="FNanchor_477:5_2420" id="FNanchor_477:5_2420"></a><a href="#Footnote_477:5_2420" class="fnanchor">[477:5]</a></p>

<p>Our Aryan forefathers looked up to the <i>heavens</i> and they gave it the
name of <i>Dyaus</i>, from a root-word which means "<i>to shine</i>." And when,
out of the forces and forms of nature, they afterwards fashioned other
gods, this name of Dyaus became <i>Dyaus pitar</i>, the <i>Heaven-father</i>, or
Lord of All; and in far later times, when the western Aryans had found
their home in Europe, the <i>Dyaus pitar</i> of the central Asian land became
the <i>Zeupater</i> of the Greeks, and the <i>Jupiter</i> of the Romans, and the
first part of his name gave <i>us</i> the word <i>Deity</i>.</p>

<p>According to Egyptian mythology, Isis was also the Earth.<a name="FNanchor_477:6_2421" id="FNanchor_477:6_2421"></a><a href="#Footnote_477:6_2421" class="fnanchor">[477:6]</a> Again,
from the union of Seb and Nut sprung the mild Osiris. Seb is the
<i>Earth</i>, Nut is <i>Heaven</i>, and Osiris is the <i>Sun</i>.<a name="FNanchor_477:7_2422" id="FNanchor_477:7_2422"></a><a href="#Footnote_477:7_2422" class="fnanchor">[477:7]</a></p>

<p>Tacitus, the Roman historian, speaking of the Germans in <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 98, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is nothing in these several tribes that merit
attention, except that they all agree in worshiping the
goddess <i>Earth</i>, or as they call her, <i>Herth</i>, whom they
consider as the common mother of all."<a name="FNanchor_477:8_2423" id="FNanchor_477:8_2423"></a><a href="#Footnote_477:8_2423" class="fnanchor">[477:8]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span></p><p>These virgin mothers, and virgin goddesses of antiquity, were also, at
times, personifications of the <i>Moon</i>, or of Nature.<a name="FNanchor_478:1_2424" id="FNanchor_478:1_2424"></a><a href="#Footnote_478:1_2424" class="fnanchor">[478:1]</a></p>

<p>Who is "God the <i>Father</i>," who overshadows the maiden? The overshadowing
of the maiden by "God the Father," whether he be called Zeus, Jupiter or
Jehovah, is simply the <i>Heaven</i>, the <i>Sky</i>, the "<i>All-father</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_478:2_2425" id="FNanchor_478:2_2425"></a><a href="#Footnote_478:2_2425" class="fnanchor">[478:2]</a>
looking down upon with love, and overshadowing the maiden, the broad
flushing light of <i>Dawn</i>, or the <i>Earth</i>. From this union the <i>Sun</i> is
born without any carnal intercourse. The <i>mother</i> is yet a <i>virgin</i>.
This is illustrated in Hindoo mythology by the union of Pritrivi,
"<i>Mother Earth</i>," with Dyaus, "Heaven." Various deities were regarded as
their progeny.<a name="FNanchor_478:3_2426" id="FNanchor_478:3_2426"></a><a href="#Footnote_478:3_2426" class="fnanchor">[478:3]</a> In the Vedic hymns the <i>Sun</i>&mdash;the Lord and
Saviour, the Redeemer and Preserver of Mankind&mdash;is frequently called the
"<i>Son of the Sky</i>."<a name="FNanchor_478:4_2427" id="FNanchor_478:4_2427"></a><a href="#Footnote_478:4_2427" class="fnanchor">[478:4]</a></p>

<p>According to Egyptian mythology, Seb (the <i>Earth</i>) is overshadowed by
Nut (<i>Heaven</i>), the result of this union being the beneficent Lord and
Saviour, Osiris.<a name="FNanchor_478:5_2428" id="FNanchor_478:5_2428"></a><a href="#Footnote_478:5_2428" class="fnanchor">[478:5]</a> The same thing is to be found in ancient Grecian
mythology. Zeus or Jupiter is the <i>Sky</i>,<a name="FNanchor_478:6_2429" id="FNanchor_478:6_2429"></a><a href="#Footnote_478:6_2429" class="fnanchor">[478:6]</a> and Danae, Leto,
Iokaste, Io and others, are the <i>Dawn</i>, or <i>the violet light of
morning</i>.<a name="FNanchor_478:7_2430" id="FNanchor_478:7_2430"></a><a href="#Footnote_478:7_2430" class="fnanchor">[478:7]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>Sky</i> appeared to men (says Plutarch), to perform the
functions of a <i>Father</i>, as the <i>Earth</i> those of a <i>Mother</i>.
The sky was the father, for it cast seed into the bosom of the

forth, and was the mother."<a name="FNanchor_479:1_2431" id="FNanchor_479:1_2431"></a><a href="#Footnote_479:1_2431" class="fnanchor">[479:1]</a></p></div>

<p>This union has been sung in the following verses by Virgil:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0i">Conjugis in grenium l&aelig;t&aelig; descendit."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem">(Geor. ii.)</p>

<p>The <i>Phenician</i> theology is founded on the same principles. <i>Heaven</i> and
<i>Earth</i> (called Ouranos and Gh&egrave;) are at the head of a genealogy of &aelig;ons,
whose adventures are conceived in the mythological style of these
physical allegorists.<a name="FNanchor_479:2_2432" id="FNanchor_479:2_2432"></a><a href="#Footnote_479:2_2432" class="fnanchor">[479:2]</a></p>

<p>In the Samothracian mysteries, which seem to have been the most
anciently established ceremonies of the kind in Europe, the <i>Heaven</i> and
the <i>Earth</i> were worshiped as a male and female <i>divinity</i>, and as the
<i>parents of all things</i>.<a name="FNanchor_479:3_2433" id="FNanchor_479:3_2433"></a><a href="#Footnote_479:3_2433" class="fnanchor">[479:3]</a></p>

<p>The Supreme God (the <i>Al-fader</i>), of the ancient <i>Scandinavians</i> was
<i>Odin</i>, a personification of the <i>Heavens</i>. The principal goddess among
them was <i>Frigga</i>, a personification of the <i>Earth</i>. It was the opinion
among these people that this Supreme Being or Celestial God had united
with the Earth (Frigga) to produce "Baldur the Good" (the Sun), who
corresponds to the Apollo of the Greeks and Romans, and the Osiris of
the Egyptians.<a name="FNanchor_479:4_2434" id="FNanchor_479:4_2434"></a><a href="#Footnote_479:4_2434" class="fnanchor">[479:4]</a></p>

<p><i>Xiuletl</i>, in the Mexican language, signifies <i>Blue</i>, and hence was a
name which the Mexican gave to <i>Heaven</i>, from which <i>Xiuleticutli</i> is
derived, an epithet signifying "<i>the God of Heaven</i>," which they
bestowed upon <i>Tezcatlipoca</i>, who was the "Lord of All," the "Supreme
God." He it was who overshadowed the Virgin of Tula, Chimelman, who
begat the Saviour Quetzalcoatle (the Sun).</p>

<p>A glance at a geography of the heavens will show the "chaste, pure,
immaculate Virgin, suckling an infant," preceded by a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span><i>Star</i>, which
rises immediately preceding the Virgin and her child. This can truly be
called "<i>his Star</i>," which informed the "Wise Men," the
"Magi"&mdash;<i>Astrologers and Sun-worshipers</i>&mdash;and "the shepherds who watched
their flocks by night" that the Saviour of Mankind was about to be born.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Heavenly Host sang praises.</i> All nature smiles at the birth of
the Heavenly Being. "To him all angels cry aloud, the heavens, and all
the powers therein." "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
good will towards men." "The quarters of the horizon are irradiate with
joy, as if moonlight was diffused over the whole earth." "The spirits
and nymphs of heaven dance and sing." "Caressing breezes blow, and a
marvelous light is produced." For the Lord and Saviour is born, "to give
joy and peace to men and Devas, <i>to shed light in the dark places</i>, and
to give sight to the blind."<a name="FNanchor_480:1_2435" id="FNanchor_480:1_2435"></a><a href="#Footnote_480:1_2435" class="fnanchor">[480:1]</a></p>

<p>5. <i>He was visited by the Magi.</i> This is very natural, for the Magi were
<i>Sun-worshipers</i>, and at early dawn on the 25th of December, the
astrologers of the Arabs, Chaldeans, and other Oriental nations, greeted
the infant Saviour with gold, frankincense and myrrh. They started to
salute their God long before the rising of the Sun, and having ascended
a high mountain, they waited anxiously for his birth, facing the East,
and there hailed his first rays with incense and prayer.<a name="FNanchor_480:2_2436" id="FNanchor_480:2_2436"></a><a href="#Footnote_480:2_2436" class="fnanchor">[480:2]</a> The
shepherds also, who remained in the open air watching their flocks by
night, were in the habit of prostrating themselves, and paying homage to
their god, the Sun. And, like the poet of the Veda, they said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Will the powers of darkness be conquered by the <i>god of light</i>?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And when the Sun rose, they wondered how, just born, he was so mighty.
They greeted him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hail, Orient Conqueror of Gloomy Night."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the human eye felt that it could not bear the brilliant majesty of
him whom they called, "The Life, the Breath, the Brilliant Lord and
Father." And they said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Let us worship again the <i>Child of Heaven</i>, the Son of
Strength, Arusha, the Bright Light of the Sacrifice." "He
rises as a mighty flame, he stretches out his wide arms, he is
even like the wind." "His light is powerful, and his (virgin)
mother, the Dawn, gives him the best share, the first worship
among men."<a name="FNanchor_480:3_2437" id="FNanchor_480:3_2437"></a><a href="#Footnote_480:3_2437" class="fnanchor">[480:3]</a></p></div>

<p>6. <i>He was born in a Cave.</i> In this respect also, the history of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span><i>Christ</i> Jesus corresponds with that of other Sun-gods and Saviours,
for they are nearly all represented as being born in a cave or dungeon.
This is the dark abode from which the wandering <i>Sun</i> starts in the
morning.<a name="FNanchor_481:1_2438" id="FNanchor_481:1_2438"></a><a href="#Footnote_481:1_2438" class="fnanchor">[481:1]</a> As the Dawn springs fully armed from the forehead of the
cloven Sky, so the eye first discerns the blue of heaven, as the first
faint arch of light is seen in the East. This arch is the cave in which
the infant is nourished until he reaches his full strength&mdash;in other
words, until the day is fully come.</p>

<p>As the hour of his birth drew near, the mother became more beautiful,
her form more brilliant, while the dungeon was filled with a heavenly
light as when Zeus came to Danae in a golden shower.<a name="FNanchor_481:2_2439" id="FNanchor_481:2_2439"></a><a href="#Footnote_481:2_2439" class="fnanchor">[481:2]</a></p>

<p>At length the child is born, and a halo of serene light encircles his
cradle, just as the Sun appears at early dawn in the East, in all its
splendor. His presence reveals itself there, in the dark cave, by his
first rays, which brightens the countenances of his mother and others
who are present at his birth.<a name="FNanchor_481:3_2440" id="FNanchor_481:3_2440"></a><a href="#Footnote_481:3_2440" class="fnanchor">[481:3]</a></p>

<p>6. <i>He was ordered to be put to death.</i> All the Sun-gods are fated to
bring ruin upon their parents or the <i>reigning monarch</i>.<a name="FNanchor_481:4_2441" id="FNanchor_481:4_2441"></a><a href="#Footnote_481:4_2441" class="fnanchor">[481:4]</a> For this
reason, they attempt to prevent his birth, and failing in this, seek to
destroy him when born. Who is the dark and wicked Kansa, or his
counterpart Herod? He is <i>Night</i>, who reigns supreme, but who must lose
his power when the young prince of glory, the Invincible, is born.</p>

<p>The <i>Sun</i> scatters the <i>Darkness</i>; and so the phrase went that the child
was to be the destroyer of the reigning monarch, or his parent, <i>Night</i>;
and oracles, and magi, it was said, warned the latter of the doom which
would overtake him. The newly-born babe is therefore ordered to be put
to death by the sword, or exposed on the bare hillside, as the Sun seems
to rest on the Earth (Ida) at its rising.<a name="FNanchor_481:5_2442" id="FNanchor_481:5_2442"></a><a href="#Footnote_481:5_2442" class="fnanchor">[481:5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span></p><p>In oriental mythology, the destroying principle is generally
represented as a serpent or dragon.<a name="FNanchor_482:1_2443" id="FNanchor_482:1_2443"></a><a href="#Footnote_482:1_2443" class="fnanchor">[482:1]</a> Now, the position of the
sphere on Christmas-day, the birthday of the Sun, shows the Serpent all
but touching, and certainly aiming at the woman&mdash;that is, the figure of
the constellation <i>Virgo</i>&mdash;who suckles the child Iessus in her arms.
Thus we have it illustrated in the story of the snake who was sent to
kill Hercules, when an infant in his cradle;<a name="FNanchor_482:2_2444" id="FNanchor_482:2_2444"></a><a href="#Footnote_482:2_2444" class="fnanchor">[482:2]</a> also in the story of
Typhon, who sought the life of the infant Saviour Horus. Again, it is
illustrated in the story of the virgin mother Astrea, with her babe
beset by Orion, and of Latona, the mother of Apollo, when pursued by the
monster.<a name="FNanchor_482:3_2445" id="FNanchor_482:3_2445"></a><a href="#Footnote_482:3_2445" class="fnanchor">[482:3]</a> And last, that of the virgin mother Mary, with her babe
beset by Herod. But like Hercules, Horus, Apollo, Theseus, Romulus,
Cyrus and other <i>solar heroes</i>, <i>Christ</i> Jesus has yet a long course
before him. Like them, he grows up both wise and strong, and the "old
Serpent" is discomfited by him, just as the sphynx and the dragon are
put to night by others.</p>

<p>7. <i>He was tempted by the devil.</i> The temptation by, and victory over
the evil one, whether Mara or Satan, is the victory of the <i>Sun</i> over
the clouds of storm and darkness.<a name="FNanchor_482:4_2446" id="FNanchor_482:4_2446"></a><a href="#Footnote_482:4_2446" class="fnanchor">[482:4]</a> Growing up in obscurity, the
day comes when he makes himself known, tries himself in his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>first
battles with his gloomy foes, and <i>shines</i> without a rival. He is rife
for his destined mission, but is met by the demon of storm, who runs to
dispute with him in the duel of the storm. In this struggle against
darkness the beneficent hero remains the conqueror, the gloomy army of
Mara, or Satan, broken and rent, is scattered; the Apearas, daughters of
the demon, the last light vapors which float in the heaven, try in vain
to clasp and retain the vanquisher; he disengages himself from their
embraces, repulses them; they writhe, lose their form, and vanish.</p>

<p>Free from every obstacle, and from every adversary, he sets in motion
across space his disk with a thousand rays, having avenged the attempts
of his eternal foe. He appears then in all his glory, and in his
sovereign splendor; the god has attained the summit of his course, it is
the moment of triumph.</p>

<p>8. <i>He was put to death on the cross.</i> The Sun has now reached his
extreme Southern limit, his career is ended, and he is at last overcome
by his enemies. The powers of <i>darkness</i>, and of <i>winter</i>, which had
sought in vain to wound him, have at length won the victory. The bright
Sun of summer is finally slain, <i>crucified in the heavens</i>, and pierced
by the arrow, spear or thorn of winter.<a name="FNanchor_483:1_2447" id="FNanchor_483:1_2447"></a><a href="#Footnote_483:1_2447" class="fnanchor">[483:1]</a> Before he dies, however,
he sees all his disciples&mdash;his retinue of light, and the <i>twelve</i> hours
of the day, or the twelve months of the year&mdash;disappear in the
sanguinary m&ecirc;l&eacute;e of the clouds of the evening.</p>

<p>Throughout the tale, the <i>Sun-god</i> was but fulfilling his doom. These
things must be. The suffering of a violent death was a necessary part of
the mythos; and, when his hour had come, he must meet his doom, as
surely as the Sun, once risen, must go across the sky, and then sink
down into his bed beneath the earth or sea. It was an iron fate from
which there was no escaping.</p>

<p>Crishna, the crucified Saviour of the Hindoos, is a personification of
the Sun crucified in the heavens. One of the names of the Sun in the
Vedic hymns is <i>Vishnu</i>,<a name="FNanchor_483:2_2448" id="FNanchor_483:2_2448"></a><a href="#Footnote_483:2_2448" class="fnanchor">[483:2]</a> and Crishna is Vishnu in human

<p>The principal Phenician deity, El, which, says Parkhurst, in his Hebrew
Lexicon, "was the very name the heathens gave to their god <span class="smcap">Sol</span>, their
Lord or Ruler of the Hosts of Heaven," was called "<i>The Preserver</i> (or
<i>Saviour</i>) of <i>the World</i>," for the benefit of which <i>he offered a

<p>The crucified <i>Iao</i> ("Divine Love" personified) is the crucified Adonis,
the Sun. The Lord and Saviour Adonis was called <i>Iao</i>.<a name="FNanchor_484:4_2453" id="FNanchor_484:4_2453"></a><a href="#Footnote_484:4_2453" class="fnanchor">[484:4]</a></p>

<p><i>Osiris</i>, the Egyptian Saviour, was crucified in the heavens. To the
Egyptian the cross was the symbol of immortality, an emblem of the
<i>Sun</i>, and the god himself was crucified to the tree, which denoted his
fructifying power.<a name="FNanchor_484:5_2454" id="FNanchor_484:5_2454"></a><a href="#Footnote_484:5_2454" class="fnanchor">[484:5]</a></p>

<p><i>Horus</i> was also crucified in the heavens. He was represented, like
Crishna and Christ Jesus, with <i>outstretched arms in the vault of
heaven</i>.<a name="FNanchor_484:6_2455" id="FNanchor_484:6_2455"></a><a href="#Footnote_484:6_2455" class="fnanchor">[484:6]</a></p>

<p>The story of the crucifixion of <i>Prometheus</i> was allegorical, for
Prometheus was only a title of the <span class="smcap">Sun</span>, expressing <i>providence</i> or
<i>foresight</i>, wherefore his being <i>crucified</i> in the extremities of the
earth, signified originally no more than the restriction of the power of
the <span class="smcap">Sun</span> during the winter months.<a name="FNanchor_484:7_2456" id="FNanchor_484:7_2456"></a><a href="#Footnote_484:7_2456" class="fnanchor">[484:7]</a></p>

<p>Who was <i>Ixion</i>, bound on the wheel? He was none other than the god
<i>Sol</i>, crucified in the heavens.<a name="FNanchor_484:8_2457" id="FNanchor_484:8_2457"></a><a href="#Footnote_484:8_2457" class="fnanchor">[484:8]</a> Whatever be the origin of the

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span></p><p>The <i>wheel</i> upon which Ixion and criminals were said to have been
extended <i>was a cross</i>, although the name of the thing was dissembled
among Christians; it was a St. Andrew's cross, of which two spokes
confined the arms, and two the legs. (See <a href="#Fig_35">Fig. No. 35</a>.)</p>

<p>The allegorical tales of the triumphs and misfortunes of the <i>Sun</i>-gods
of the ancient Greeks and Romans, signify the alternate exertion of the
generative and destructive attributes.</p>

<p><i>Hercules</i> is torn limb from limb; and in this catastrophe we see the

<p><i>Achilleus</i> and <i>Meleagros</i> represent alike the <i>short-lived Sun</i>, whose
course is one of toil for others, ending in an early death, after a
series of wonderful victories alternating with periods of darkness and
gloom.<a name="FNanchor_485:2_2460" id="FNanchor_485:2_2460"></a><a href="#Footnote_485:2_2460" class="fnanchor">[485:2]</a></p>

<p>In the tales of the Trojan war, it is related of Achilleus that he
expires at the Skaian, or <i>western gates of the evening</i>. He is slain by
Paris, who here appears as the Pani, or dark power, who blots out the
light of the Sun from the heaven.<a name="FNanchor_485:3_2461" id="FNanchor_485:3_2461"></a><a href="#Footnote_485:3_2461" class="fnanchor">[485:3]</a></p>

<p>We have also the story of <i>Adonis</i>, born of a virgin, and known in the
countries where he was worshiped as "The Saviour of Mankind," killed by
the wild <i>boar</i>, afterwards "rose from the dead, and ascended into
heaven." This Adonis, Adonai&mdash;in Hebrew "My Lord"&mdash;is simply the <i>Sun</i>.
He is crucified in the heavens, put to death by the wild boar, <i>i. e.</i>,
<i>Winter</i>. "Babylon called Typhon or Winter <i>the boar</i>; they said he
killed Adonis or the fertile <i>Sun</i>."<a name="FNanchor_485:4_2462" id="FNanchor_485:4_2462"></a><a href="#Footnote_485:4_2462" class="fnanchor">[485:4]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Crucified Dove</i> worshiped by the ancients, was none other than the
crucified Sun. Adonis was called the <i>Dove</i>. At the ceremonies in honor
of his resurrection from the dead, the devotees said, "Hail to the Dove!
the Restorer of Light."<a name="FNanchor_485:5_2463" id="FNanchor_485:5_2463"></a><a href="#Footnote_485:5_2463" class="fnanchor">[485:5]</a> <a href="#Fig_35">Fig. No. 35</a> is the "Crucified Dove" as
described by Pindar, the great lyric poet of Greece, born about 522 <span class="allcapsc">B.
C.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"We read in Pindar, (says the author of a learned work
entitled "Nimrod,") of the venerable bird Iynx bound to the
wheel, and of the pretended punishment of Ixion. But this
rotation was really no punishment, being, as Pindar saith,
<i>voluntary</i>, and prepared <i>by himself</i> and <i>for himself</i>; or
if it was, it was appointed in derision of his false
pretensions, whereby he gave himself out as <i>the crucified
spirit of the world</i>." "The four spokes represent St. Andrew's
cross, adapted to the four limbs extended, and furnish perhaps
the oldest <i>profane</i> allusion to the crucifixion. The same
cross of St. Andrew was the <i>Taw</i>, which Ezekiel commands them
to mark upon the foreheads of the faithful, as appears from
all Israelitish coins whereon that letter is engraved. The
same idea was familiar to Lucian, who calls T <i>the letter of
crucifixion</i>. Certainly, the veneration for the cross is very
ancient. Iynx, the bird of Mautic inspiration, bound to the
four-legged wheel, gives the notion of <i>Divine Love
crucified</i>. The wheel denotes the world, of which she is the
spirit, and the cross <i>the sacrifice made for that
world</i>."<a name="FNanchor_486:1_2464" id="FNanchor_486:1_2464"></a><a href="#Footnote_486:1_2464" class="fnanchor">[486:1]</a></p></div>

<p>This "<i>Divine Love</i>," of whom Nimrod speaks, was "<i>The First-begotten
Son</i>" of the Platonists. The crucifixion of "<i>Divine Love</i>" is often
found among the Greeks. I&ouml;nah or Juno, according to the <i>Iliad</i>, was
bound with fetters, and <i>suspended in space</i>, between heaven and earth.
Ixion, Prometheus, Apollo of Miletus, (anciently the greatest and most
flourishing city of Ionia, in Asia Minor), were all crucified.<a name="FNanchor_486:2_2465" id="FNanchor_486:2_2465"></a><a href="#Footnote_486:2_2465" class="fnanchor">[486:2]</a></p>

<p>Semi-Ramis was both a queen of unrivaled celebrity, and also a goddess,
worshiped under the form of a Dove. Her name signifies the <i>Supreme
Dove</i>. She is said to have been slain by the last survivor of her sons,
while others say, she flew away as a bird&mdash;a Dove. In both Grecian and
Hindoo histories this mystical queen Semiramis is said to have fought a
battle on the banks of the Indus, with a king called Staurobates, in
which she was defeated, and from which she flew away in the form of a
Dove. Of this Nimrod says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The name Staurobates, the king by whom Semiramis was finally
overpowered, <i>alluded to the cross on which she perished</i>,"
and that, "<i>the crucifixion was made into a glorious mystery
by her infatuated adorers</i>."<a name="FNanchor_486:3_2466" id="FNanchor_486:3_2466"></a><a href="#Footnote_486:3_2466" class="fnanchor">[486:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Here again we have the crucified Dove, the <i>Sun</i>, for it is well known
that the ancients personified the Sun <i>female</i> as well as male.</p>

<p>We have also the fable of the Crucified Rose, illustrated in the jewel
of the <i>Rosicrucians</i>. The jewel of the Rosicrucians is formed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>of a
transparent red stone, with a red <i>cross</i> on one side, and a red <i>rose</i>
on the other&mdash;thus it is a <i>crucified rose</i>. "The Rossi, or
Rosy-crucians' idea concerning this emblematic red cross," says Hargrave
Jennings, in his <i>History of the Rosicrucians</i>, "probably came from the
fable of <i>Adonis</i>&mdash;<i>who was the Sun whom we have so often seen
crucified</i>&mdash;being changed into a red rose by Venus."<a name="FNanchor_487:1_2467" id="FNanchor_487:1_2467"></a><a href="#Footnote_487:1_2467" class="fnanchor">[487:1]</a></p>

<p>The emblem of the <i>Templars</i> is a red rose on a cross. "When it can be
done, it is surrounded with a glory, and placed on a calvary (Fig. No.
36). This is the Naurutz, Natsir, or Rose of Isuren, of Tamul, or
Sharon, or the Water Rose, the Lily Padma, Pena, Lotus, <i>crucified in
the heavens for the salvation of man</i>.<ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_487:2_2468" id="FNanchor_487:2_2468"></a><a href="#Footnote_487:2_2468" class="fnanchor">[487:2]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Christ Jesus was called the <span class="smcap">Rose</span>&mdash;the Rose of Sharon&mdash;of Isuren. He was
the renewed incarnation of <i>Divine Wisdom</i>. He was the son of Maia or
Maria. He was the Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the Valley, which
bloweth in the month of his mother Maia. Thus, when the angel Gabriel
gives the salutation to the Virgin, he presents her with the lotus or
lily; as may be seen in hundreds of old pictures in Italy. We see
therefore that Adonis, "the Lord," "the Virgin-born," "the Crucified,"
"the Resurrected Dove," "the Restorer of Light," is one and the same
with the "Rose of Sharon," the crucified Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Plato (429 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>) in his <i>Pim&aelig;us</i>, philosophizing about the Son of God,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>next power</i> to the Supreme God was decussated or figured
<i>in the shape of a cross on the universe</i>."</p></div>

<p>This brings to recollection the doctrine of certain so-called Christian
<i>heretics</i>, who maintained that Christ Jesus was crucified in the
heavens.</p>

<p>The <i>Chr&egrave;stos</i> was the Logos, the <i>Sun</i> was the manifestation of the
Logos or Wisdom to men; or, as it was held by some, it was his peculiar
habitation. The Sun being crucified at the time of the winter solstice
was represented by the young man slaying the <i>Bull</i> (<i>an emblem of the
Sun</i>) in the Mithraic ceremonies, and the slain <i>lamb</i> at the foot of
the cross in the Christian ceremonies. The Chr&#275;st was the Logos, or
Divine Wisdom, or a portion of divine <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>wisdom incarnate; in this sense
he is really the Sun or the solar power incarnate, and to him everything
applicable to the Sun will apply.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_37">Fig. No. 37</a>, taken from Mr. Lundy's "Monumental Christianity," is
evidently a representation of the Christian Saviour <i>crucified in the
heavens</i>. Mr. Lundy calls it "Crucifixion in Space," and believes that
it was intended for the Hindoo Saviour Crishna, who is also represented
crucified in space (See <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. No. 8</a>, Ch. XX.). This (<a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a>) is exactly
in the form of a Romish crucifix, <i>but not fixed to a piece of wood</i>,
though the legs and feet are put together in the usual way. There is a
glory over it, <i>coming from above</i>, not shining <i>from the figure</i>, as is
generally seen in a Roman crucifix. It has a pointed <i>Parthian coronet</i>
instead of a crown of thorns. All the avatars, or incarnations of
Vishnu, are painted with Ethiopian or Parthian coronets. For these
reasons the Christian author will not own that it is a representation of
the "True Son of Justice," for he <i>was not</i> crucified in space; but
whether it was intended to represent Crishna, Wittoba, or Jesus,<a name="FNanchor_488:1_2469" id="FNanchor_488:1_2469"></a><a href="#Footnote_488:1_2469" class="fnanchor">[488:1]</a>
it tells a secret: it shows that some one was represented <i>crucified in
the heavens</i>, and undoubtedly has something to do with "The next power
to the Supreme God," who, according to Plato, "was decussated or figured
<i>in the shape of a cross on the universe</i>."</p>

<p>Who was the crucified god whom the ancient Romans worshiped, and whom
they, according to Justin Martyr, represented as <i>a man on a cross</i>? Can
we doubt, after what we have seen, that he was this same <i>crucified
Sol</i>, whose birthday they annually celebrated on the 25th of December?</p>

<p>In the poetical tales of the ancient <i>Scandinavians</i>, the same legend is
found. Frey, <i>the Deity of the Sun</i>, was fabled to have been killed, at
the time of the winter solstice, by the same boar who put the god Adonis
to death, therefore a boar was annually offered <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>to him at the great
feast of Yule.<a name="FNanchor_489:1_2470" id="FNanchor_489:1_2470"></a><a href="#Footnote_489:1_2470" class="fnanchor">[489:1]</a> "Baldur the Good," son of the supreme god Odin,
and the virgin-goddess Frigga, was also put to death by the sharp thorn
of winter.</p>

<p>The ancient <i>Mexican</i> crucified Saviour, Quetzalcoatle, another
personification of the Sun, was sometimes represented as crucified in
space, <i>in the heavens</i>, in a circle of nineteen figures, the number of
the metonic cycle. A <i>serpent</i> (the emblem of evil, darkness, and
winter) is depriving him of the organs of generation.<a name="FNanchor_489:2_2471" id="FNanchor_489:2_2471"></a><a href="#Footnote_489:2_2471" class="fnanchor">[489:2]</a></p>

<p>We have seen in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXXIII">Chapter XXXIII.</a> that Christ Jesus, and many of the
heathen saviours, healers, and preserving gods, were represented in the
form of a Serpent. This is owing to the fact that, <i>in one of its
attributes</i>, the Serpent was an emblem of the <i>Sun</i>. It may, at first,
appear strange that the Serpent should be an emblem of evil, and yet
also an emblem of the beneficent divinity; but, as Prof. Renouf remarks,
in his <i>Hibbert Lectures</i>, "The moment we understand the nature of a
myth, all impossibilities, contradictions, and immoralities disappear."
The serpent is an emblem of evil when represented with his <i>deadly
sting</i>; he is the emblem of eternity when represented <i>casting off his
skin</i>;<a name="FNanchor_489:3_2472" id="FNanchor_489:3_2472"></a><a href="#Footnote_489:3_2472" class="fnanchor">[489:3]</a> and an emblem of the Sun when represented <i>with his tail
in his mouth</i>, thus forming a circle.<a name="FNanchor_489:4_2473" id="FNanchor_489:4_2473"></a><a href="#Footnote_489:4_2473" class="fnanchor">[489:4]</a> Thus there came to be, not
only good, but also bad, serpents, both of which are referred to in the
narrative of the Hebrew exodus, but still more clearly in the struggle
between the good and the bad serpents of Persian mythology, which
symbolized Ormuzd, or Mithra, and the evil spirit Ahriman.<a name="FNanchor_489:5_2474" id="FNanchor_489:5_2474"></a><a href="#Footnote_489:5_2474" class="fnanchor">[489:5]</a></p>

<p>As the Dove and the Rose, emblems of the Sun, were represented on the
cross, so was the Serpent.<a name="FNanchor_489:6_2475" id="FNanchor_489:6_2475"></a><a href="#Footnote_489:6_2475" class="fnanchor">[489:6]</a> The famous "Brazen Serpent," said to
have been "set up" by Moses in the wilderness, is called in the Targum
(the general term for the Aramaic versions of the Old <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>Testament) the
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span>. It was probably a serpentine crucifix, as it is called a
<i>cross</i> by Justin Martyr. The crucified serpent (<a href="#Fig_38">Fig. No. 38</a>) denoted
the <i>quiescent Phallos</i>, or the Sun after it had lost its power. It is
the Sun in winter, crucified on the tree, which denoted its fructifying
power.<a name="FNanchor_490:1_2476" id="FNanchor_490:1_2476"></a><a href="#Footnote_490:1_2476" class="fnanchor">[490:1]</a> As Mr. Wake remarks, "There can be no doubt that both the

<p>The Ophites, who venerated the serpent as an emblem of Christ Jesus, are
said to have maintained that the serpent of Genesis&mdash;who brought
<i>wisdom</i> into the world&mdash;was Christ Jesus. The brazen serpent was called
the <span class="smcap">Word</span> by the Chaldee paraphrast. The Word, or Logos, was <i>Divine
Wisdom</i>, which was crucified; thus we have the cross, or Linga, or
Phallus, with the serpent upon it. Besides considering the serpent as
the emblem of Christ Jesus, or of the Logos, the Ophites are said to
have revered it as the cause of all the arts of civilized life. In
<a href="#CHAPTER_XII">Chapter XII.</a> we saw that several illustrious females were believed to
have been selected and impregnated by the Holy Ghost. In some cases, a
serpent was supposed to be the form which it assumed. This was the
incarnation of the Logos.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
The serpent was held in great veneration by the ancients, who, as we
have seen, considered it as the symbol of the beneficent Deity, and an
emblem of eternity. As such it has been variously expressed on ancient
sculptures and medals in various parts of the globe.</p>

<p>Although generally, it did not always, symbolize the god <i>Sun</i>, or the
power of which the Sun is an emblem; but, invested with various
meanings, it entered widely into the primitive mythologies. As Mr.
Squire observes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It typified wisdom, power, duration, the <i>good</i> and <i>evil</i>
principles, life, reproduction&mdash;in short, in Egypt, Syria,
Greece, India, China, Scandinavia, America, everywhere on the
globe, it has been a prominent emblem."<a name="FNanchor_491:1_2478" id="FNanchor_491:1_2478"></a><a href="#Footnote_491:1_2478" class="fnanchor">[491:1]</a></p></div>

<p>The serpent was the symbol of Vishnu, the preserving god, the Saviour,
the <i>Sun</i>.<a name="FNanchor_491:2_2479" id="FNanchor_491:2_2479"></a><a href="#Footnote_491:2_2479" class="fnanchor">[491:2]</a> It was an emblem of the <i>Sun</i>-god Buddha, the

symbolized as a serpent; and so was &AElig;sculapius and Apollo. The Hebrews,
who, as we have seen in <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">Chapter XI.</a>, worshiped the god Sol, represented
him in the form of a serpent. This is the <i>seraph</i>&mdash;spoken of above&mdash;as
set up by Moses (Num. xxi. 3) and worshiped by the children of Israel.
<span class="smcap">Se&nbsp;ra&nbsp;ph</span> is the singular of seraphim, meaning <i>Semilic&eacute;</i>&mdash;<i>splendor</i>,
<i>fire</i>, <i>light</i>&mdash;emblematic of the fiery disk of the Sun, and which,
under the name of <i>Nehush-tan</i>, "Serpent-dragon," was broken up by the
reforming Hezekiah.</p>

<p>The principal god of the <i>Aztecs</i> was <i>Tonac</i>-atlcoatl, which means the
<i>Serpent Sun</i>.<a name="FNanchor_491:8_2485" id="FNanchor_491:8_2485"></a><a href="#Footnote_491:8_2485" class="fnanchor">[491:8]</a></p>

<p>The Mexican virgin-born Lord and Saviour, Quetzalcoatle, was represented
in the form of a serpent. In fact, his name signifies "<i>Feathered
Serpent</i>." Quetzalcoatle was a personification of the <i>Sun</i>.<a name="FNanchor_491:9_2486" id="FNanchor_491:9_2486"></a><a href="#Footnote_491:9_2486" class="fnanchor">[491:9]</a></p>

<p>Under the aspect of the <i>active principle</i>, we may rationally <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>connect
the <i>Serpent</i> and the <i>Sun</i>, as corresponding symbols of the
<i>reproductive</i> or <i>creative power</i>. <a href="#Fig_40">Figure No. 40</a> is a symbolical sign,
representing the disk of the <i>Sun</i> encircled by the serpent <i>Uraeus</i>,
meaning the "<span class="smcap">King Sun</span>," or "<span class="smcap">Royal Sun</span>," as it often surmounts the
persons of Egyptian monarchs, confirmed by the <i>emblem of</i> <span class="allcapsc">LIFE</span>
depending from the serpent's neck.<a name="FNanchor_492:1_2487" id="FNanchor_492:1_2487"></a><a href="#Footnote_492:1_2487" class="fnanchor">[492:1]</a></p>

<p>The mysteries of Osiris, Isis, and Horus, in <i>Egypt</i>; Atys and Cybele,
in <i>Phrygia</i>; Ceres and Proserpine, at <i>Eleusis</i>; of Venus and Adonis,
in <i>Phenicia</i>; of Bona Dea and Priapus, in <i>Rome</i>, are all susceptible
of one explanation. They all set forth and illustrated, by solemn and
impressive rites, and <i>mystical symbols</i>, the grand phenomenon of
<i>nature</i>, especially as connected with the creation of things and the
perpetuation of life. In all, it is worthy of remark, the <span class="allcapsc">SERPENT</span> was
more or less conspicuously introduced, and always as symbolical of the
invigorating or active energy of nature, the <span class="smcap">Sun</span>.</p>

<p>We have seen (in <a href="#CHAPTER_XX">Chapter XX.</a>) that in early Christian art Christ Jesus
also was represented as a <i>crucified Lamb</i>. This crucified lamb is "the
Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world, and slain from the
foundation of the world."<a name="FNanchor_492:2_2488" id="FNanchor_492:2_2488"></a><a href="#Footnote_492:2_2488" class="fnanchor">[492:2]</a> In other words, the crucified lamb
typifies the <i>crucified Sun</i>, for the lamb was another symbol of the
Sun, as we shall presently see.</p>

<p>We find, then, that the stories of the crucifixions of the different
so-called <span class="smcap">Saviours</span> of mankind <i>all melt into</i> <span class="stressed">one</span>, and that they are
<i>allegorical</i>, for "<i>Saviour</i>" was only a title of the <i>Sun</i>,<a name="FNanchor_492:3_2489" id="FNanchor_492:3_2489"></a><a href="#Footnote_492:3_2489" class="fnanchor">[492:3]</a> and
his being put to death on the cross, signifies no more than the
restriction of the power of the Sun in the winter quarter. With Justin
Martyr, then, we can say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><a name="Justin_Martyr_quote" id="Justin_Martyr_quote"></a>"There exists not a people, whether Greek or barbarian, or any

fair and beautiful lights which flush the Eastern sky as the Sun sinks
or dies in the West.<a name="FNanchor_493:4_2493" id="FNanchor_493:4_2493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493:4_2493" class="fnanchor">[493:4]</a> Their tears are the tears of dew, such as

<p>All the Sun-gods forsake their homes and virgin mothers, and wander
through different countries doing marvellous things. Finally, at the end
of their career, the mother, from whom they were parted long ago, is by
their side to cheer them in their last hours.<a name="FNanchor_493:5_2494" id="FNanchor_493:5_2494"></a><a href="#Footnote_493:5_2494" class="fnanchor">[493:5]</a></p>

<p>The ever-faithful women were to be found at the last scene in the life
of <i>Buddha</i>. Kasyapa having found the departed master's feet soiled and
wet, asked Nanda the cause of it. "He was told that a weeping woman had
embraced Gautama's feet shortly before his death, and that her tears had
fallen on his feet and left the marks on them."<a name="FNanchor_493:6_2495" id="FNanchor_493:6_2495"></a><a href="#Footnote_493:6_2495" class="fnanchor">[493:6]</a></p>

<p>In his last hours, <i>&OElig;dipous</i> (the Sun) has been cheered by the

<p>At the death of <i>Hercules</i>, Iole (<i>the fair-haired Dawn</i>) stands by his
side, cheering him to the last. With her gentle hands she sought to
soothe his pain, and with pitying words to cheer him in his woe. Then
once more the face of Hercules flushed with a deep joy, and he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ah, Iole, brightest of maidens, thy voice shall cheer me as I
sink down in the sleep of death. I saw and loved thee in the
bright <i>morning time</i>, and now again thou hast come, <i>in the

<i>dying Sun</i>."</p></div>

<p>The <i>black mists</i> were spreading over the sky, but still Hercules sought
to gaze on the fair face of Iole, and to comfort her in her sorrow.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Weep not, Iole," he said, "my toil is done, and now is the
time for rest. I shall see thee again in the bright land which
is never trodden by the feet of night."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span></p><p>The same story is related in the legend of <i>Apollo</i>. The Dawn, from

his dying agonies, but the chorus of ever amiable and ever-faithful
women, which also bewailed and lamented him, but were unable to subdue
his inflexible philanthropy.<a name="FNanchor_494:4_2500" id="FNanchor_494:4_2500"></a><a href="#Footnote_494:4_2500" class="fnanchor">[494:4]</a></p>

ends the tale of the long toil and sorrows of other Sun-gods. The last
scene exhibits a manifest return to the spirit of the solar myth. He
must not die the common death of all men, for no disease or corruption
can touch the body of the brilliant Sun. After a long struggle against
the dark clouds who are arrayed against him, he is finally overcome, and
dies. Blacker and blacker grow the evening shades, and finally "there is
darkness on the face of the earth," and the din of its thunder clashes
through the air.<a name="FNanchor_494:6_2502" id="FNanchor_494:6_2502"></a><a href="#Footnote_494:6_2502" class="fnanchor">[494:6]</a></p>

<p>It is the picture of a sunset in wild confusion, of a sunset more awful,

<i>Sun</i>, who sinks slowly down, with the ghastly hues of death upon his

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>the astronomical winter begins. The days have reached their shortest
span, and the <i>Sun</i> has reached his extreme southern limit. The winter
solstice reigns, and the Sun seems to stand still in his southern
course. For three days and three nights he remains in hell&mdash;the lower
regions.<a name="FNanchor_495:1_2505" id="FNanchor_495:1_2505"></a><a href="#Footnote_495:1_2505" class="fnanchor">[495:1]</a> In this respect <i>Christ</i> Jesus is like other

<p>In the ancient sagas of Iceland, the hero who is the Sun personified,
descends into a tomb, where he fights a vampire. After a desperate
struggle, the hero overcomes, and rises to the surface of the earth.
"This, too, represents the Sun in the northern realms, descending into
the tomb of winter, and there overcoming the power of darkness."<a name="FNanchor_495:3_2507" id="FNanchor_495:3_2507"></a><a href="#Footnote_495:3_2507" class="fnanchor">[495:3]</a></p>

<p>12. <i>He rose again from the dead, and ascended into heaven.</i>
Resurrections from the dead, and ascensions into heaven, are generally
acknowledged to be <i>solar</i> features, as the history of many solar heroes
agree in this particular.</p>

<p>At the <i>winter solstice</i> the ancients wept and mourned for <i>Tammuz</i>, the
fair Adonis, and other Sun-gods, done to death by the boar, or
crucified&mdash;slain by the thorn of winter&mdash;and on the <i>third day</i> they
rejoiced at the resurrection of their "Lord of Light."<a name="FNanchor_495:4_2508" id="FNanchor_495:4_2508"></a><a href="#Footnote_495:4_2508" class="fnanchor">[495:4]</a></p>

<p>With her usual policy, the Church endeavored to give a Christian
significance to the rites which they borrowed from heathenism, and in
this case, the mourning for Tammuz, the fair Adonis, became the mourning
for Christ Jesus, and joy at the rising of the natural Sun became joy at
the rising of the "Sun of Righteousness"&mdash;at the resurrection of Christ
Jesus from the grave.</p>

<p>This festival of the Resurrection was generally held by the ancients on
the 25th of March, when the awakening of <i>Spring</i> may be said to be the
result of the return of the Sun from the lower or far-off regions to
which he had departed. At the equinox&mdash;say, the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>vernal&mdash;at <i>Easter</i>,
the Sun has been below the equator, and suddenly rises above it. It has
been, as it were, dead to us, but now it exhibits a resurrection.<a name="FNanchor_496:1_2509" id="FNanchor_496:1_2509"></a><a href="#Footnote_496:1_2509" class="fnanchor">[496:1]</a>
The Saviour rises triumphant over the powers of darkness, to life and
immortality, on the 25th of March, when the Sun rises in Aries.</p>

<p>Throughout all the ancient world, <i>the resurrection of the god Sol</i>,
under different names, was celebrated on March 25th, with great
rejoicings.<a name="FNanchor_496:2_2510" id="FNanchor_496:2_2510"></a><a href="#Footnote_496:2_2510" class="fnanchor">[496:2]</a></p>

<p>In the words of the Rev. Geo. W. Cox:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The wailing of the Hebrew women at the death of Tammuz, the
crucifixion and resurrection of Osiris, the adoration of the
Babylonian Mylitta, the Sacti ministers of Hindu temples, the
cross and crescent of Isis, the rites of the Jewish altar of
Baal-Peor, wholly preclude all doubt of the real nature of the
great <i>festivals</i> and <i>mysteries</i> of Phenicians, Jews,
Assyrians, Egyptians, and Hindus."<a name="FNanchor_496:3_2511" id="FNanchor_496:3_2511"></a><a href="#Footnote_496:3_2511" class="fnanchor">[496:3]</a></p></div>

<p>All this was <i>Sun</i> and Nature worship, symbolized by the <i>Linga</i> and
<i>Yoni</i>. As Mr. Bonwick says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The philosophic theist who reflects upon the story, known
from the walls of China, across Asia and Europe, to the
plateau of Mexico, cannot resist the impression that no
<i>materialistic</i> theory of it can be satisfactory."<a name="FNanchor_496:4_2512" id="FNanchor_496:4_2512"></a><a href="#Footnote_496:4_2512" class="fnanchor">[496:4]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Allegory</i> alone explains it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Church, at an early date, selected the heathen festivals
of <i>Sun worship</i> for its own, ordering the <i>birth at
Christmas</i>, a fixed time, and the <i>resurrection at Easter</i>, a
varying time, as in all Pagan religions; since, though the Sun
rose directly after the vernal equinox, the festival, to be
correct in a <i>heathen</i> point of view, had to be associated
with the new moon."<a name="FNanchor_496:5_2513" id="FNanchor_496:5_2513"></a><a href="#Footnote_496:5_2513" class="fnanchor">[496:5]</a></p></div>

<p>The Christian, then, may well say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of winter, thou didst
open the kingdom of heaven (<i>i. e.</i>, bring on the reign of
summer), to all believers."</p></div>

<p>13. <i>Christ Jesus is Creator of all things.</i> We have seen (in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXVI">Chapter
XXVI.</a>) that it was not God the Father, who was supposed by the ancients
to have been the <i>Creator</i> of the world, but God the Son, the Redeemer
and Saviour of Mankind. Now, this Redeemer and Saviour was, as we have
seen, the Sun, and Prof. Max M&uuml;ller tells us that in the <i>Vedic</i>
mythology, the Sun is not the bright Deva only, "who performs his daily
task in the sky, but he is supposed to perform much greater work. He is
looked upon, in fact, as the <i>Ruler</i>, as the <i>Establisher</i>, as the
<i>Creator of the world</i>."<a name="FNanchor_496:6_2514" id="FNanchor_496:6_2514"></a><a href="#Footnote_496:6_2514" class="fnanchor">[496:6]</a></p>

<p>Having been invoked as the "Life-bringer," the Sun is also <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>called&mdash;in
the Rig-Veda&mdash;"the Breath or Life of all that move and rest;" and lastly
he becomes "<i>The Maker of all things</i>," by whom all the worlds have been
brought together.<a name="FNanchor_497:1_2515" id="FNanchor_497:1_2515"></a><a href="#Footnote_497:1_2515" class="fnanchor">[497:1]</a></p>

<p>There is a prayer in the <i>Vedas</i>, called <i>Gayatree</i>, which consists of
three measured lines, and is considered the holiest and most efficacious
of all their religious forms. Sir William Jones translates it thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Let us adore the supremacy of that spiritual Sun, the
godhead, who illuminates all, who re-creates all, from whom
all proceed, to whom all must return; whom we invoke to direct
our undertakings aright in our progress toward his holy seat."</p></div>

<p>With Seneca (a Roman philosopher, born at Cordova, Spain, 61 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>)
then, we can say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"You may call the Creator of all things by different names
(Bacchus, Hercules, Mercury, etc.), but they are only
different names of the same divine being, the <i>Sun</i>."</p></div>

<p>14. <i>He is to be Judge of the quick and the dead.</i> Who is better able
than the Sun to be the judge of man's deeds, seeing, as he does, from
his throne in heaven, all that is done on earth? The Vedas speak of
S&ucirc;rya&mdash;the pervading, irresistible luminary&mdash;as seeing all things and
hearing all things, <i>noting the good and evil deeds of men</i>.<a name="FNanchor_497:2_2516" id="FNanchor_497:2_2516"></a><a href="#Footnote_497:2_2516" class="fnanchor">[497:2]</a></p>

<p>According to Hindoo mythology, says Prof. Max M&uuml;ller:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Sun sees everything, both what is good and what is evil;
and how natural therefore that (in the Indian Veda) both the
evil-doer should be told that the sun sees what no human eye
may have seen, and that the innocent, when all other help
fails him, should appeal to the sun to attest his
guiltlessness."</p>

<p>"Frequent allusion is made (in the Rig-Veda), to the sun's
power of seeing everything. The stars flee before the
all-seeing sun, like thieves. He sees the right and the wrong
among men. He who looks upon the world knows also the thoughts
in all men. As the sun sees everything and knows everything,
he is asked to forget and forgive what he alone has seen and
knows."<a name="FNanchor_497:3_2517" id="FNanchor_497:3_2517"></a><a href="#Footnote_497:3_2517" class="fnanchor">[497:3]</a></p></div>

<p>On the most ancient Egyptian monuments, Osiris, the Sun personified, is
represented as Judge of the dead. The Egyptian "Book of the Dead," the
oldest Bible in the world, speaks of Osiris as "seeing all things, and
hearing all things, noting the good and evil deeds of men."</p>

<p>15. <i>He will come again sitting on a white horse.</i> The "second coming"
of Vishnu (Crishna), <i>Christ</i> Jesus, and other Sun-gods, are also
<i>astronomical allegories</i>. The <i>white horse</i>, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>which figures so
conspicuously in the legend, was the universal symbol of the Sun among
Oriental nations.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole legend, <i>Christ</i> Jesus is the toiling Sun, laboring
for the benefit of others, not his own, and doing hard service for a
mean and cruel generation. Watch his sun-like career of brilliant
conquest, checked with intervals of storm, and declining to a death
clouded with sorrow and derision. He is in constant company with his
<i>twelve</i> apostles, the <i>twelve signs of the zodiac</i>.<a name="FNanchor_498:1_2518" id="FNanchor_498:1_2518"></a><a href="#Footnote_498:1_2518" class="fnanchor">[498:1]</a> During the
course of his life's journey he is called "The God of Earthly Blessing,"
"The Saviour through whom a new life springs," "The Preserver," "The
Redeemer," &amp;c. Almost at his birth the Serpent of darkness attempts to
destroy him. Temptations to sloth and luxury are offered him in vain. He
has his work to do, and nothing can stay him from doing it, as nothing
can arrest the Sun in his journey through the heavens. Like all other
solar heroes, he has his faithful women who love him, and the Marys and
Martha here play the part. Of his toils it is scarcely necessary to
speak in detail. They are but a thousand variations on the story of the
great conflict which all the Sun-gods wage against the demon of
darkness. He astonishes his tutor when sent to school. This we might
expect to be the case, when an incomparable and incommunicable wisdom is
the heritage of the Sun. He also represents the wisdom and beneficence
of the bright Being who brings life and light to men. As the Sun wakens
the earth to life when the winter is done, so Crishna, Buddha, Horus,
&AElig;sculapius, and <i>Christ</i> Jesus were raisers of the dead. When the leaves
fell and withered on the approach of winter, the "daughter of the earth"
would be spoken of as dying or dead, and, as no other power than that of
the Sun can recall vegetation to life, this child of the earth would be
represented as buried in a sleep from which the touch of the Sun alone
could rouse her.</p>

<p><i>Christ</i> Jesus, then, is the Sun, in his short career and early death.
He is the child of the Dawn, whose soft, violet hues tint <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>the clouds of
early morn; his father being the Sky, the "Heavenly Father," who has
looked down with love upon the Dawn, and overshadowed her. When his
career on earth is ended, and he expires, the loving mother, who parted
from him in the morning of his life, is at his side, looking on the
death of the Son whom she cannot save from the doom which is on him,
while her tears fall on his body like rain at sundown. From her he is
parted at the beginning of his course; to her he is united at its close.
But <i>Christ</i> Jesus, like Crishna, Buddha, Osiris, Horus, Mithras,
Apollo, Atys and others, <i>rises again</i>, and thus the myth takes us a
step beyond the legend of Serpedon and others, which stop at the end of
the eastward journey, when the night is done.</p>

<p>According to the Christian calendar, the birthday of John the Baptist is
on the day of the summer solstice, when the sun begins to decrease. How
true to nature then are the words attributed to him in the fourth
Gospel, when he says that he must <i>decrease</i>, and Jesus <i>increase</i>.</p>

<p>Among the ancient Teutonic nations, fires were lighted, on the tops of
hills, on the 24th of June, in honor of the <span class="smcap">wending Sun</span>. This custom is
still kept up in Southern Germany and the Scotch highlands, and it is
the day selected by the Roman Catholic church to celebrate the nativity
of John the Baptist.<a name="FNanchor_499:1_2519" id="FNanchor_499:1_2519"></a><a href="#Footnote_499:1_2519" class="fnanchor">[499:1]</a></p>

<p>Mosheim, the ecclesiastical historian, speaking of the uncertainty of
the time when <i>Christ</i> Jesus was born, says: "The uncertainty of this
point is of no great consequence. We know that the <i>Sun of
Righteousness</i> has shone upon the world; and although we cannot fix the
precise period in which he arose, this will not preclude us from
enjoying the direction and influence of his vital and salutary beams."</p>

<p>These sacred legends abound with such expressions as can have no
possible or conceivable application to any other than to the "God of
day." He is "a light to lighten the Gentiles, and to be the glory (or
brightness) of his people."<a name="FNanchor_499:2_2520" id="FNanchor_499:2_2520"></a><a href="#Footnote_499:2_2520" class="fnanchor">[499:2]</a> He is come "a light into the world,

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Lighten our darkness, we beseech thee, Adonai, and by thy
great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this

<p>"When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man, thou passest

<p>"All are agreed," says Cicero, "that Apollo is none other than the <span class="smcap">Sun</span>,
because the attributes which are commonly ascribed to Apollo do so
wonderfully agree thereto."</p>

<p>Just so surely as Apollo is the Sun, so is the Lord <i>Christ</i> Jesus the
Sun. That which is so conclusive respecting the Pagan deities, applies
also to the God of the Christians; but, like the Psalmist of old, they
cry, "Touch not <span class="allcapsc">MY</span> Christ, and do my prophets no harm."</p>

<p>Many Christian writers have seen that the history of their Lord and
Saviour is simply the history of the Sun, but they either say nothing,
or, like Dr. Parkhurst and the Rev. J. P. Lundy, claim that the Sun is a
type of the true Sun of Righteousness. Mr. Lundy, in his "Monumental
Christianity," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Is there no bright Sun of Righteousness&mdash;no <i>personal</i> and
loving Son of God, <i>of whom the material Sun has been the type
or symbol, in all ages and among all nations</i>? What power is
it that comes from the Sun to give light and heat to all
created things? If the symbolical Sun leads such a great
earthly and heavenly flock, what must be said to the <i>true</i>
and only begotten Son of God? If Apollo was adopted by early
Christian art as a <i>type</i> of the Good Shepherd of the New
Testament, <i>then this interpretation of the Sun-god among all
nations must be the solution of the universal mythos, or what
other solution can it have</i>? To what other <i>historical</i>
personage but Christ can it apply? <i>If this mythos has no
spiritual meaning, then all religion becomes mere idolatry, or
the worship of material things.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_500:1_2524" id="FNanchor_500:1_2524"></a><a href="#Footnote_500:1_2524" class="fnanchor">[500:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Mr. Lundy, who seems to adhere to this once-upon-a-time favorite theory,
illustrates it as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The young <i>Isaac</i> is his (Christ's) Hebrew type, bending
under the wood, as Christ fainted under the cross; <i>Daniel</i> is
his type, stripped of all earthly fame and greatness, and cast
naked into the deepest danger, shame and humiliation." "<i>Noah</i>
is his type, in saving men from utter destruction, and
bringing them across the sea of death to a new world and a new
life." "<i>Orpheus</i> is a type of Christ. <i>Agni</i> and <i>Crishna</i> of
India; <i>Mithra</i> of Persia; <i>Horus</i> and <i>Apollo</i> of Egypt, are
all types of Christ." "<i>Samson</i> carrying off the gates of Gaza
and defeating the Philistines by his own death, was considered
as a type of Christ <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>bursting open and carrying away the gates
of Hades, and conquering His and our enemies by his death and
resurrection."<a name="FNanchor_501:1_2525" id="FNanchor_501:1_2525"></a><a href="#Footnote_501:1_2525" class="fnanchor">[501:1]</a></p></div>

<p>According to this theory, the whole Pagan religion was typical of Christ
and Christianity. Why then were not the Pagans the Lord's <i>chosen</i>
people instead of the children of Israel?</p>

<p>The early Christians were charged with being a sect of <i>Sun
worshipers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_501:2_2526" id="FNanchor_501:2_2526"></a><a href="#Footnote_501:2_2526" class="fnanchor">[501:2]</a> The ancient Egyptians worshiped the god <i>Serapis</i>,
and Serapis was the <i>Sun</i>. <a href="#Fig_11">Fig. No. 11</a>, page 194, shows the manner in
which Serapis was personified. It might easily pass for a representation
of the Sun-god of the Christians. Mr. King says, in his "Gnostics, and
their Remains":</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There can be no doubt that the head of Serapis, marked as the
face is by a grave and pensive majesty, <i>supplied the first
idea for the conventional portraits of the Saviour</i>."<a name="FNanchor_501:3_2527" id="FNanchor_501:3_2527"></a><a href="#Footnote_501:3_2527" class="fnanchor">[501:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The Imperial Russian Collection <i>boasts</i> of a head of Christ Jesus which
is said to be very ancient. It is a fine intaglio on emerald. Mr. King
says of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is in reality a head of <i>Serapis</i>, seen in front and
crowned with Persia boughs, easily mistaken for thorns, though
the bushel on the head leaves no doubt as to the real
personage intended."<a name="FNanchor_501:4_2528" id="FNanchor_501:4_2528"></a><a href="#Footnote_501:4_2528" class="fnanchor">[501:4]</a></p></div>

<p>It must not be forgotten, in connection with this, that the worshipers
of Serapis, or the Sun, were called <i>Christians</i>.<a name="FNanchor_501:5_2529" id="FNanchor_501:5_2529"></a><a href="#Footnote_501:5_2529" class="fnanchor">[501:5]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Jameson, speaking on this subject, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We search in vain for the lightest evidence of his (Christ's)
human, individual semblance, in the writing of those disciples
who knew him so well. In this instance the instincts of
earthly affection seem to have been mysteriously overruled. He
whom all races of men were to call brother, was not to be too
closely associated with the particular lineaments of any one.
St. John, the beloved disciple, could lie on the breast of
Jesus with all the freedom of fellowship, but not even he has
left a word to indicate what manner of man was the Divine
Master after the flesh.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Legend has, in various form,
supplied this natural craving, but it is hardly necessary to
add, that all accounts of pictures of our Lord taken from
Himself are without historical foundation. <i>We are therefore
left to imagine the expression</i> most befitting the character
of him who took upon himself our likeness, and looked at the
woes and sins of mankind through the eyes of our
mortality."<a name="FNanchor_501:6_2530" id="FNanchor_501:6_2530"></a><a href="#Footnote_501:6_2530" class="fnanchor">[501:6]</a></p></div>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Geikie says, in his "Life of Christ":</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"No hint is given in the New Testament of Christ's
<i>appearance</i>; and the early Church, in the absence of all
guiding facts, had to fall back on imagination."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>"In its <i>first</i> years, the Christian church fancied its
Lord's visage and form <i>marred more than those of other men</i>;
and that he must have had no attractions of personal beauty.
Justin Martyr (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 150-160) speaks of him as <i>without beauty
or attractiveness</i>, and of <i>mean appearance</i>. Clement of
Alexandria (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 200), describes him as of an <i>uninviting
appearance</i>, and <i>almost repulsive</i>. Tertullian (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span>
200-210) says he had not even <i>ordinary human beauty</i>, far
less heavenly. Origen (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 230) went so far as to say that
he was '<i>small in body and deformed</i>', as well as low-born,
and that, '<i>his only beauty was in his soul and
life</i>.'"<a name="FNanchor_502:1_2531" id="FNanchor_502:1_2531"></a><a href="#Footnote_502:1_2531" class="fnanchor">[502:1]</a></p></div>

<p>One of the favorite ways finally, of depicting him, was, as Mr. Lundy
remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Under the figure of a beautiful and adorable youth, of about
fifteen or eighteen years of age, beardless, with a sweet
expression of countenance, <i>and long and abundant hair flowing
in curls over his shoulders</i>. His brow is sometimes encircled
by a diadem or bandeau, <i>like a young priest of the Pagan
gods</i>; that is, in fact, the favorite figure. On sculptured
sarcophagi, in fresco paintings and Mosaics, Christ is thus
represented as a graceful youth, <i>just as Apollo was figured
by the Pagans</i>, and as angels are represented by
Christians."<a name="FNanchor_502:2_2532" id="FNanchor_502:2_2532"></a><a href="#Footnote_502:2_2532" class="fnanchor">[502:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Thus we see that the Christians took the paintings and statues of the
Sun-gods Serapis and Apollo <i>as models</i>, when they wished to represent
<i>their</i> Saviour. That the former is the favorite at the present day need
not be doubted when we glance at <a href="#Fig_11">Fig. No. 11</a>, page 194.</p>

<p>Mr. King, speaking of this god, and his worshipers, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is very good reason to believe that in the <i>East</i> the
worship of <i>Serapis</i> was at first combined with
<i>Christianity</i>, and gradually merged into it with an entire
change of name, <i>not substance</i>, carrying with it many of its
ancient notions and rites."<a name="FNanchor_502:3_2533" id="FNanchor_502:3_2533"></a><a href="#Footnote_502:3_2533" class="fnanchor">[502:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Again he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the second century the syncretistic sects that had sprung
up in <i>Alexandria</i>, the very hotbed of Gnosticism, found out
in <i>Serapis</i> a prophetic <i>type</i> of Christ, or the Lord and
Creator of all."<a name="FNanchor_502:4_2534" id="FNanchor_502:4_2534"></a><a href="#Footnote_502:4_2534" class="fnanchor">[502:4]</a></p></div>

<p>The early <i>Christians</i>, or worshipers of the Sun, under the name of
"<i>Christ</i>," had, as all Sun-worshipers, <i>a peculiar regard to the
East</i>&mdash;the quarter in which their god rose&mdash;<i>to which point they
ordinarily directed their prayers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_502:5_2535" id="FNanchor_502:5_2535"></a><a href="#Footnote_502:5_2535" class="fnanchor">[502:5]</a></p>

<p>The followers of Mithra always turned towards the East, when they
worshiped; the same was done by the Brahmans of the East, and the
Christians of the West. In the ceremony of baptism, the catechumen was
placed with his face to the West, the symbolical representation of the
prince of darkness, in opposition to the East, and made to spit towards
it at the evil one, and renounce his works.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span></p><p>Tertullian says, that Christians were taken for worshipers of the Sun
because they prayed towards the East, after the manner of those who
adored the Sun. The Essenes&mdash;whom Eusebius calls Christians&mdash;always
turned to the east to pray. The Essenes met once a week, and spent the
night in singing hymns, &amp;c., which lasted till sun-rising. As soon as
dawn appeared, they retired to their cells, after saluting one another.
Pliny says the Christians of Bithynia met before it was light, and sang
hymns to Christ, as to a God. After their service they saluted one
another. Surely the circumstances of the two classes of people meeting
before daylight, is a very remarkable coincidence. It is just what the
Persian Magi, who were Sun worshipers, were in the habit of doing.</p>

<p>When a Manich&aelig;an Christian came over to the orthodox Christians, he was
required to curse his former friends in the following terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I curse Zarades (Zoroaster?) who, Manes said, had appeared as
a god before his time among the Indians and Persians, <i>and
whom he calls the Sun</i>. I curse those who say <i>Christ is the
Sun</i>, and who make prayers to the <i>Sun</i>, and who do not pray
to the true God, only towards the East, but who turn
themselves round, following the motions of the Sun with their
innumerable supplications. <i>I curse those person who say that
Zarades and Budas and Christ and the Sun are all one and the
same.</i>"</p></div>

<p>There are not many circumstances more striking than that of Christ Jesus
being originally worshiped under the form of a <span class="smcap">Lamb</span>&mdash;the actual "Lamb of
God, which taketh away the sins of the world." As we have already seen
(in <a href="#CHAPTER_XX">Chap. XX.</a>), it was not till the Council of Constantinople, called
<i>In Trullo</i>, held so late as the year 707, that pictures of Christ Jesus
were ordered to be drawn in the form of a man. It was ordained that, in
the place of the figure of a <span class="smcap">Lamb</span>, the symbol used to that time, the
figure of a man nailed to a cross, should in future be used.<a name="FNanchor_503:1_2536" id="FNanchor_503:1_2536"></a><a href="#Footnote_503:1_2536" class="fnanchor">[503:1]</a> From
this decree, the identity of the worship of the <i>Celestial Lamb</i> and the
Christian Saviour is certified beyond the possibility of doubt, and the
mode by which the ancient superstitions were propagated is
satisfactorily shown. Nothing can more clearly prove the general
practice than the order of a council to regulate it.</p>

<p>The worship of the constellation of <i>Aries</i> was the worship of the Sun
in his passage through that sign. "This constellation was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>called by the
ancients the <i>Lamb of God</i>. He was also called the <i>Saviour</i>, and was
said to save mankind from their sins. He was always honored with the
appellation of <i>Dominus</i> or <i>Lord</i>. He was called <i>The Lamb of God which
taketh away the sins of the world</i>. The devotees addressed him in their
litany, constantly repeating the words, '<i>O Lamb of God, that taketh
away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us. Grant us thy peace.</i>'"</p>

<p>On an ancient medal of the <i>Phenicians</i>, brought by Dr. Clark from
Citium (and described in his "Travels," vol. ii. ch. xi.) this <i>Lamb of
God</i> is described with the <span class="smcap">Cross</span> and the <span class="smcap">Rosary</span>, which shows that they
were both used in his worship.</p>

<p>Yearly the <span class="smcap">Sun-god</span>, as the zodiacal horse (Aries) was supposed by the
Vedic Aryans <i>to die to save all flesh</i>. Hence the practice of
sacrificing horses. The "guardian spirits" of the prince Sakya Buddha
sing the following hymn:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Once when thou wast the <i>white horse</i>,<a name="FNanchor_504:1_2537" id="FNanchor_504:1_2537"></a><a href="#Footnote_504:1_2537" class="fnanchor">[504:1]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0i">In pity for the suffering of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Thou didst fly across heaven to the region of the evil demons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i"><i>To secure the happiness of mankind</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Persecutions without end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Revilings and many prisons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i"><i>Death and murder</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">These hast thou suffered with love and patience,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i"><i>Forgiving thine executioners</i>."<a name="FNanchor_504:2_2538" id="FNanchor_504:2_2538"></a><a href="#Footnote_504:2_2538" class="fnanchor">[504:2]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We have seen, in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXXIII">Chapter XXXIII.</a>, that Christ Jesus was also symbolized
as a <i>Fish</i>, and that it is to be seen on all the ancient Christian
monuments. But what has the Christian Saviour to do with a <i>Fish</i>? Why
was he called a <i>Fish</i>? The answer is, <i>because the fish was another
emblem of the</i> <span class="smcap">Sun</span>. Abarbanel says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The sign of his (Christ's) coming is the junction of Saturn
and Jupiter, <i>in the Sign Pisces</i>."<a name="FNanchor_504:3_2539" id="FNanchor_504:3_2539"></a><a href="#Footnote_504:3_2539" class="fnanchor">[504:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Applying the astronomical emblem of <i>Pisces</i> to Jesus, does not seem
more absurd than applying the astronomical emblem of the Lamb. They
applied to him the monogram of the Sun, IHS, the astronomical and
alchemical sign of Aries, or the ram, or Lamb <span class="nowrap"><img src="images/symbol_pg504.png" class="letter" alt="Aries symbol" />;</span> and, in short,
what was there that was <i>Heathenish</i> that they have not applied to him?</p>

<p>The preserving god Vishnu, the Sun, was represented as a fish, and so
was the Syrian Sun-god Dagon, who was also a Preserver or Saviour. The
Fish was sacred among many nations of antiquity, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>and is to be seen on
their monuments. Thus we see that everything at last centres in the <span class="smcap">Sun</span>.</p>

<p>Constantine, the first Christian emperor, had on his <i>coins</i> the figure
of the Sun, with the legend: "To the Invincible Sun, my companion and
guardian," as being a representation, says Mr. King, "either of the
ancient Ph&oelig;bus, <i>or the</i> new <i>Sun of Righteousness</i>, equally
acceptable to both Christian and Gentile, from the double interpretation
of which the type was susceptible."<a name="FNanchor_505:1_2540" id="FNanchor_505:1_2540"></a><a href="#Footnote_505:1_2540" class="fnanchor">[505:1]</a></p>

<p>The worship of the Sun, under the name of Mithra, "long survived in
Rome, <i>under the Christian emperors</i>, and, doubtless, much longer in the
remoter districts of the semi-independent provinces."<a name="FNanchor_505:2_2541" id="FNanchor_505:2_2541"></a><a href="#Footnote_505:2_2541" class="fnanchor">[505:2]</a></p>

<p><i>Christ</i> Jesus is represented with a halo of glory surrounding his head,
a florid complexion, long golden locks of hair, and a flowing robe. Now,
all <i>Sun</i>-gods, from Crishna of India (Fig. No. 41) to Baldur of
Scandinavia, are represented with a halo of glory surrounding their
heads, and the flowing locks of golden hair, and the flowing robe, are
not wanting.<a name="FNanchor_505:3_2542" id="FNanchor_505:3_2542"></a><a href="#Footnote_505:3_2542" class="fnanchor">[505:3]</a> By a process of metaphor, the rays <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>of the Sun were
changed into golden hair, into spears and lances, and robes of light.
From the shoulders of Phoibus Lyk&ecirc;genes, the light-born, flow the sacred
locks over which no razor might pass. On the head of Nisos, as on that
of Samson, they became a palladium invested with a mysterious power.
From Helios, the Sun, who can scorch as well as warm, comes the robe of
Medeia, which appears in the poisoned garments of Deianeira.<a name="FNanchor_506:1_2543" id="FNanchor_506:1_2543"></a><a href="#Footnote_506:1_2543" class="fnanchor">[506:1]</a></p>

<p>We see, then, that <i>Christ</i> Jesus, like <i>Christ</i> Buddha,<a name="FNanchor_506:2_2544" id="FNanchor_506:2_2544"></a><a href="#Footnote_506:2_2544" class="fnanchor">[506:2]</a> Crishna,
Mithra, Osiris, Horus, Apollo, Hercules and others, is none other than a
personification of the Sun, and that the Christians, like their
predecessors the Pagans, are really Sun worshipers. It must not be
inferred, however, that we advocate the theory that no such person as
<i>Jesus of Nazareth</i> ever lived in the flesh. The <i>man</i> Jesus is
evidently an historical personage, just as the Sakaya prince Buddha,
Cyrus, King of Persia, and Alexander, King of Macedonia, are historical
personages; but the <i>Christ</i> Jesus, the <i>Christ</i> Buddha, the mythical
Cyrus, and the mythical Alexander, <i>never lived in the flesh</i>. The
<i>Sun-myth</i> has been added to the histories of these personages, in a
greater or less degree, just as it has been added to the history of many
other real personages. If it be urged that the attribution to Christ
Jesus of qualities or powers belonging to the Pagan deities would hardly
seem reasonable, the answer must be that nothing is done in his case
which has not been done in the case of almost every other member of the
great company of the gods. The tendency of myths to <i>reproduce
themselves</i>, with differences only of <i>names</i> and <i>local coloring</i>,
becomes especially manifest after perusing the legendary histories of
the gods of antiquity. It is a fact demonstrated by history, that when
one nation of antiquity came in contact with another, <i>they adopted each
other's myths without hesitation</i>. After the Jews had been taken
captives to Babylon, around the history of <i>their King Solomon</i>
accumulated the fables which were related of <i>Persian heroes</i>. When the
fame of Cyrus and Alexander became known over the then known world, the
popular <i>Sun-myth</i> was interwoven with their true history. The mythical
history of Perseus is, in all its essential features, the history of the
Attic hero Theseus, and of the Theban &OElig;dipus, and they all reappear
with heightened colors in the myths of Hercules. We have the same thing
again in the mythical and religious history of Crishna; it is, in nearly
all its essential features, the history of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>Buddha, and reappears again,
with heightened colors, in the history of <i>Christ</i> Jesus. The myths of
Buddha and Jesus differ from the legends of the other virgin-born
Saviours only in the fact that in their cases it has gathered round
unquestionably historical personages. In other words, an old myth has
been added to names undoubtedly historical. But it cannot be too often
repeated that from the <i>myth</i> we learn nothing of their history. How
much we really know of the man Jesus will be considered in our next, and
last, chapter.<a name="FNanchor_507:1_2545" id="FNanchor_507:1_2545"></a><a href="#Footnote_507:1_2545" class="fnanchor">[507:1]</a> That his biography, as recorded in the books of
the New Testament, contains some few grains of actual history, is all
that the historian or philosopher can rationally venture to urge. But
the very process which has stripped these legends of all value as a
chronicle of actual events has invested them with a new interest. Less
than ever are they worthless fictions which the historian or philosopher
may afford to despise. These legends of the birth, life, and death of
the Sun, present to us a form of society and a condition of thought
through which all mankind had to pass before the dawn of history. Yet
that state of things was as real as the time in which we live. They who
spoke the language of these early tales were men and women with joys and
sorrows not unlike our own. In the following verses of Martianus
Capella, the universal veneration for the Sun is clearly shown:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Latium invokes thee, <i>Sol</i>, because thou alone art in honor,
<i>after the Father</i>, the centre of light; and they affirm that
thy sacred head bears a golden brightness in twelve rays,
because thou formest that number of months and that number of
hours. They say that thou guidest four winged steeds, because
thou alone rulest the chariot of the elements. For, dispelling
the darkness, thou revealest the shining heavens. Hence they
esteem thee, Ph&oelig;bus, the discoverer of the secrets of the
future; or, because thou preventest nocturnal crimes. Egypt
worships thee as Serapis, and Memphis as Osiris. Thou art
worshiped by different rites as Mithra, Dis, and the cruel
Typhon. Thou art alone the beautiful Atys, and the fostering
son of the bent plough. Thou art the Ammon of arid Libya, and
the Adonis of Byblos. <i>Thus under a varied <ins class="corr" title="original has appelation">appellation</ins> the
whole world worship thee.</i> Hail! thou true image of the gods,
and of thy father's face! thou whose sacred name, surname, and
omen, three letters make to agree with the number 608.<a name="FNanchor_507:2_2546" id="FNanchor_507:2_2546"></a><a href="#Footnote_507:2_2546" class="fnanchor">[507:2]</a>
Grant us, oh Father, to reach the eternal intercourse of mind,
and to know the starry heaven under this sacred name. May the
great and universally adorable Father increase these his
favors."</p></div>

<p>The Moon was called by the ancients, "The Queen;" "The Highest

(Goldzhier, pp. <ins class="corr" title="original has 158, 158">158</ins>. Knight, pp. 99, 100.)</p>

<p>In the beginning of the eleventh book of Apuleius' Metamorphosis, Isis
is represented as addressing him thus: "I am present; I who am <i>Nature</i>,
the parent of things, queen of all the elements, &amp;c., &amp;c. The primitive
Phrygians called me <i>Pressinuntica, the mother of the gods</i>; the native
Athenians, Ceropian Minerva; the floating Cyprians, Paphian Venus; the
arrow-bearing Cretans, Dictymian Diana; the three-tongued Sicilians,
Stygian Proserpine; and the inhabitants of Eleusis, the ancient goddess
Ceres. Some again have invoked me as <i>Juno</i>, others as <i>Beliona</i>, others
as Hecate, and others as Rhamnusia: and those who are enlightened by the
emerging rays of the rising <i>Sun</i>, the Ethiopians, Ariians and
Egyptians, powerful in ancient learning, who reverence my divinity with
ceremonies perfectly proper, call me by a true appellation, '<i>Queen
Isis</i>.'" (Taylor's Mysteries, p. 76.)</p></div>

nothing more than a personification of the <i>Sky</i> or the <i>Heavens</i>. "The
term <i>Heaven</i> (pronounced <i>Thien</i>) is used everywhere in the Chinese
classics for the <i>Supreme Power</i>, ruling and governing all the affairs
of men with an omnipotent and omniscient righteousness and goodness."
(James Legge.)</p>

<p>In one of the Chinese sacred books&mdash;the Shu-king&mdash;<i>Heaven</i> and <i>Earth</i>
are called "Father and Mother of all things." Heaven being the Father,
and Earth the Mother. (Taylor: Primitive Culture, pp. 294-296.)</p>

<p>The "God the Father" of the Indians is <i>Dyaus</i>, that is, the <i>Sky</i>.
(Williams' Hinduism, p. 24.)</p>

<p>Ormuzd, the god of the ancient Persians, was a personification of the
sky. Herodotus, speaking of the Persians, says: "They are accustomed to
ascend the highest part of the mountains, and offer sacrifice to Jupiter
(Ormuzd), <i>and they call the whole circle of the heavens by the name of
Jupiter</i>." (Herodotus, book 1, ch. 131.)</p>

<p>In Greek iconography Zeus is the <i>Heaven</i>. As Cicero says: "The
refulgent Heaven above is that which all men call, unanimously, Jove."</p>

<p>The Christian God supreme of the nineteenth century is still <i>Dyaus</i>
Pitar, the "Heavenly Father."</p></div>

by the "Old Serpent," the Devil, symbolized by Serpents, Dragons,
Sphinxes and other monsters. The Serpent was, among the ancient Eastern
nations, the symbol of <i>Evil</i>, of <i>Winter</i>, of <i>Darkness</i> and of
<i>Death</i>. It also symbolized the <i>dark cloud</i>, which, by harboring the
<i>rays of the Sun</i>, preventing its shining, and therefore, is apparently
<i>attempting to destroy it</i>. The Serpent is one of the chief mystic
personifications of the <i>Rig-Veda</i>, under the names of <i>Ahi</i>, <i>Suchna</i>,
and others. They represent the <i>Cloud</i>, the enemy of the <i>Sun</i>, keeping
back the fructifying rays. Indra struggles victoriously against him, and
spreads life on the earth, with the shining warmth of the Father of
Life, the Creator, <i>the Sun</i>.</p>

<p>Buddha, the Lord and Saviour, was described as a superhuman organ of
light, to whom a superhuman organ of darkness, Mara, the Evil Serpent,
was opposed. He, like <i>Christ</i> Jesus, resisted the temptations of this
evil one, and is represented sitting on a serpent, as if its conqueror.
(See Bunsen's Angel-Messiah, p. 39.)</p>

<p>Crishna also overcame the evil one, and is represented "bruising the
head of the serpent," and standing upon it. (See vol. i. of Asiatic
Researches, and vol. ii. of Higgins' Anacalypsis.)</p>

<p>In Egyptian Mythology, one of the names of the god-<i>Sun</i> was <i>R&acirc;</i>. He
had an adversary who was called <i>Apap</i>, represented in the form of a
serpent. (See Renouf's Hibbert Lectures, p. 109.)</p>

<p>Horus, the Egyptian incarnate god, the Mediator, Redeemer and Saviour,
is represented in Egyptian art as overcoming the Evil Serpent, and
standing triumphantly upon him. (See Bonwick's Egyptian Belief, p. 158,
and Monumental Christianity, p. 402.)</p>

<p>Osiris, Ormuzd, Mithras, Apollo, Bacchus, Hercules, Indra, &OElig;dipus,
Quetzalcoatle, and many other <i>Sun-gods</i>, overcame the Evil One, and are
represented in the above described manner. (See Cox's Tales of Ancient
Greece, p. xxvii. and Aryan Mythology, vol. ii. p. 129. Baring-Gould's
Curious Myths, p. 256. Bulfinch's Age of Fable, p. 34. Bunsen's

Darkness triumphing over the "Lord of Light," and Winter overpowering
the Summer. It was at the <i>Winter</i> solstice that the ancients wept for
Tammuz, the fair Adonis, and other Sun-gods, who were put to death by
the boar, slain by the thorn of winter. (See Cox: Aryan Mythology, vol.
ii. p. 113.)</p>

<p>Other versions of the same myth tell us of Eurydike stung to death by
the hidden serpent, of Sifrit smitten by Hagene (the Thorn), of
Isfendiyar slain by the thorn or arrow of Rustem, of Achilleus
vulnerable only in the heel, of Brynhild enfolded within the dragon's
coils, of Meleagros dying as the torch of doom is burnt out, of Baldur,
the brave and pure, smitten by the fatal mistletoe, and of Crishna and
others being crucified.</p>

<p>In Egyptian mythology, Set, the destroyer, triumphs in the <i>West</i>. He is
the personification of <i>Darkness</i> and <i>Winter</i>, and the Sun-god whom he
puts to death, is Horus the Saviour. (See Renouf's Hibbert Lectures, pp.
112-115.)</p></div>

<p>The ancient Greek writers speak of the Sun, as the "Generator and

Gods," and the "Supreme Lord of all Beings." (Knight: Ancient Art and
Mytho., p. 37.)</p>

<p>Pausanias (500 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>) speaks of "The Sun having the surname of <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>."
(Ibid. p. 98, <i>note</i>.)</p>

<p>"There is a very remarkable figure copied in Payne Knight's Work, in
which we see on a man's shoulders a <i>cock's</i> head, whilst on the
pediment are placed the words: "<span class="smcap">The Saviour of the World</span>." (Inman: Anct.
Faiths, vol. i. p. 537.) This refers to the <span class="smcap">Sun</span>. The cock being the

to the Sun." (See Knight: Anct. Art and Mytho., p. 70, and Lardner: vol.

represented with golden locks. (Cox: Aryan Myths, vol. i. p. 341.)</p>

<p><i>Mithras</i>, the Persian Saviour, was represented with long flowing locks.</p>

<p><i>Izdubar</i>, the god and hero of the Chaldeans, was represented with long
flowing locks of hair (Smith: Chaldean Account of Genesis, p. 193), and
so was his counterpart, the Hebrew Samson.</p>

<p>"The S&acirc;kya-prince (Buddha) is described as an Aryan by Buddhistic
tradition; his face was reddish, his hair of light color and curly, his
general appearance of great beauty." (Bunsen: The Angel-Messiah, p. 15.)</p>

<p>"Serapis has, in some instances, long hair formally turned back, and
disposed in ringlets hanging down upon his breast and shoulders like
that of a woman. His whole person, too, is always enveloped in drapery
reaching to his feet." (Knight: Ancient Art and Mythology, p. 104.)</p>

<p>"As for <i>yellow hair</i>, there is no evidence that Greeks have ever
commonly possessed it; but no other color would do for a solar hero, and
it accordingly characterizes the entire company of them, wherever
found." (Fiske: Myths and Mythmakers, p. 202.)</p>

<p>Helios (the Sun) is called by the Greeks the "yellow-haired."
(Goldzhier: Hebrew Mytho., p. 137.)</p>

<p>The Sun's rays is signified by the flowing golden locks which stream
from the head of Kephalos, and fall over the shoulders of <ins class="corr" title="original has Bellerphon">Bellerophon</ins>.
(Cox: Aryan Mytho., vol. i. p. 107.)</p>

<p>Perseus, son of the virgin Danae, was called the "Golden Child." (Ibid.
vol. ii. p. 58.) "The light of early morning is not more pure than was
the color on his fair cheeks, and the golden locks streamed bright over
his shoulders, like the rays of the sun when they rest on the hills at
midday." (Tales of Ancient Greece, p. 83.)</p>

<p>The Saviour Dionysus wore a long flowing robe, and had long golden hair,
which streamed from his head over his shoulders. (Aryan Mythology, vol.
ii. p. 293.)</p>

<p>Ixion was the "Beautiful and Mighty," with golden hair flashing a glory
from his head, dazzling as the rays which stream from Helios, when he
drives his chariot up the heights of heaven; and his flowing robe
glistened as he moved, like the vesture which the Sun-god gave to the
wise maiden Medeia, who dwelt in Kolchis. (Tales of Ancient Greece, p.
47.)</p>

<p>Theseus enters the city of Athens, as Christ Jesus is said to have
entered Jerusalem, with a long flowing robe, and with his <i>golden hair</i>
tied gracefully behind his head. His "soft beauty" excites the mockery
of the populace, who pause in their work to jest with him. (Cox: Aryan
Mythology, vol. ii. p. 63.)</p>

<p>Thus we see that long locks of golden hair, and a flowing robe, are
mythological attributes of the Sun.</p></div>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>We now come to the last, but certainly not least, question to be
answered; which is, what do we really know of the man Jesus of Nazareth?
How much of the Gospel narratives can we rely upon as fact?</p>

<p>Jesus of Nazareth is so enveloped in the mists of the past, and his
history so obscured by legend, that it may be compared to footprints in
the sand. We know <i>some one</i> has been there, but as to what manner of
man he may have been, we certainly know little as fact. The Gospels,
<i>the only records we have of him</i>,<a name="FNanchor_508:1_2547" id="FNanchor_508:1_2547"></a><a href="#Footnote_508:1_2547" class="fnanchor">[508:1]</a> have been proven, over and
over again, unhistorical and legendary; to state <i>anything as positive</i>
about the man is nothing more nor less than <i>assumption</i>; we can
therefore <i>conjecture</i> only. Liberal writers philosophize and wax
eloquent to little purpose, when, after demolishing the historical
accuracy of the New Testament, they end their task by eulogizing the man
Jesus, claiming for him the <i>highest</i> praise, and asserting that he was
the <i>best</i> and <i>grandest</i> of our race;<a name="FNanchor_508:2_2548" id="FNanchor_508:2_2548"></a><a href="#Footnote_508:2_2548" class="fnanchor">[508:2]</a> but this manner of
reasoning (undoubtedly consoling to many) <i>facts</i> do not warrant. We may
consistently revere his name, and place it in the long list of the great
and noble, the reformers and religious teachers of the past, all of whom
have done their part in bringing about the freedom we now enjoy, but to
go beyond this, is, to our thinking, unwarranted.</p>

<p>If the life of Jesus of Nazareth, as related in the books of the New
Testament, be in part the story of a man who really lived and suffered,
that story has been so interwoven with images borrowed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>from myths of a
bygone age, as to conceal forever any fragments of history which may lie
beneath them. Gautama Buddha was undoubtedly an historical personage,
yet the Sun-god myth has been added to his history to such an extent
that we really know nothing positive about him. Alexander the Great was
an historical personage, yet his history is one mass of legends. So it
is with Julius Cesar, Cyrus, King of Persia, and scores of others. "The
story of Cyrus' perils in infancy belongs to <i>solar</i> mythology as much
as the stories of the magic slipper, of Charlemagne and Barbarossa. His
grandfather, Astyages, is purely a mythical creation, his name being
identical with that of the night demon, Azidahaka, who appears in the
Shah-Nameh as the biting serpent."</p>

<p>The actual Jesus is inaccessible to scientific research. His image
cannot be recovered. He left no memorial in writing of himself; his
followers were illiterate; the mind of his age was confused. Paul
received only traditions of him, how definite we have no means of
knowing, apparently not significant enough to be treasured, nor
consistent enough to oppose a barrier to his own speculations. As M.
Renan says: "The Christ who communicates private revelations to him <i>is
a phantom of his own making</i>;" "it is <i>himself</i> he listens to, <i>while
fancying that he hears Jesus</i>."<a name="FNanchor_509:1_2549" id="FNanchor_509:1_2549"></a><a href="#Footnote_509:1_2549" class="fnanchor">[509:1]</a></p>

<p>In studying the writings of the early advocates of Christianity, and
Fathers of the Christian Church, where we would naturally look for the
language that would indicate the real occurrence of the facts of the
Gospel&mdash;if real occurrences they had ever been&mdash;we not only find no such
language, but everywhere find every sort of sophistical ambages,
ramblings from the subject, and evasions of the very business before
them, as if on purpose to balk our research, and insult our skepticism.
If we travel to the very sepulchre of Christ Jesus, it is only to
discover that he was never there: <i>history</i> seeks evidence of his
existence as a man, but finds no more trace of it than of the shadow
that flits across the wall. "The Star of Bethlehem" shone not upon <i>her</i>
path, and the order of the universe was suspended without <i>her</i>
observation.</p>

<p>She asks, with the Magi of the East, "Where is he that is born King of
the Jews?" and, like them, finds no solution of her inquiry, but the
guidance that guides as well to one place as another; descriptions that
apply to &AElig;sculapius, Buddha and Crishna, as well <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>as to Jesus;
prophecies, without evidence that they were ever prophesied; miracles,
which those who are said to have seen, are said also to have denied
seeing; narratives without authorities, facts without dates, and records
without names. In vain do the so-called disciples of Jesus point to the
passages in Josephus and Tacitus;<a name="FNanchor_510:1_2550" id="FNanchor_510:1_2550"></a><a href="#Footnote_510:1_2550" class="fnanchor">[510:1]</a> in vain do they point to the
spot on which he was crucified; to the fragments of the true cross, or
the nails with which he was pierced, and to the <i>tomb</i> in which he was
laid. Others have done as much for scores of <i>mythological personages</i>
who never lived in the flesh. Did not <ins class="corr" title="original has Damis">Damus</ins>, the beloved disciple of
Apollonius of Tyana, while on his way to India, see, on Mt. Caucasus,
the identical chains with which Prometheus had been bound to the rocks?
Did not the Scythians<a name="FNanchor_510:2_2551" id="FNanchor_510:2_2551"></a><a href="#Footnote_510:2_2551" class="fnanchor">[510:2]</a> say that Hercules had visited their
country? and did they not show the print of his foot upon a rock to
substantiate their story?<a name="FNanchor_510:3_2552" id="FNanchor_510:3_2552"></a><a href="#Footnote_510:3_2552" class="fnanchor">[510:3]</a> Was not his <i>tomb</i> to be seen at Cadiz,
where his <i>bones</i> were shown?<a name="FNanchor_510:4_2553" id="FNanchor_510:4_2553"></a><a href="#Footnote_510:4_2553" class="fnanchor">[510:4]</a> Was not the <i>tomb</i> of Bacchus to be

Delphi?<a name="FNanchor_510:6_2555" id="FNanchor_510:6_2555"></a><a href="#Footnote_510:6_2555" class="fnanchor">[510:6]</a> Was not the <i>tomb</i> of Achilles to be seen at Dodona,

Was not the <i>tomb</i> of &AElig;sculapius to be seen in Arcadia, in a grove
consecrated to him, near the river Lusius?<a name="FNanchor_510:8_2557" id="FNanchor_510:8_2557"></a><a href="#Footnote_510:8_2557" class="fnanchor">[510:8]</a> Was not the <i>tomb</i> of

at the present day?<a name="FNanchor_510:12_2561" id="FNanchor_510:12_2561"></a><a href="#Footnote_510:12_2561" class="fnanchor">[510:12]</a> And did not the Emperor Constantine dedicate
a beautiful church over the <i>tomb</i> of St. George, the warrior
saint?<a name="FNanchor_510:13_2562" id="FNanchor_510:13_2562"></a><a href="#Footnote_510:13_2562" class="fnanchor">[510:13]</a> Of what value, then, is such evidence of the existence of
such an individual as Jesus of Nazareth? The fact is, "the records of
his life are so very scanty, and these have been so shaped and colored
and modified by the hands of ignorance and superstition <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>and party
prejudice and ecclesiastical purpose, that it is hard to be sure of the
original outlines."</p>

<p>In the first two centuries the professors of Christianity were divided
into many sects, but these might be all resolved into two divisions&mdash;one
consisting of Nazarenes, Ebionites, and orthodox; the other of
<i>Gnostics</i>, under which all the remaining sects arranged themselves. The
former are supposed to have believed in Jesus crucified, in the common,
literal acceptation of the term; the latter&mdash;believers in the <i>Christ</i>
as an <i>&AElig;on</i>&mdash;though they admitted the crucifixion, considered it to have
been in some <i>mystic</i> way&mdash;perhaps what might be called <i>spiritualiter</i>,
as it is called in the Revelation: but notwithstanding the different
opinions they held, they all denied that <i>the Christ</i> did really die, in
the literal acceptation of the term, on the cross.<a name="FNanchor_511:1_2563" id="FNanchor_511:1_2563"></a><a href="#Footnote_511:1_2563" class="fnanchor">[511:1]</a> The Gnostic,
or Oriental, Christians undoubtedly took their doctrine from the <i>Indian
crucifixion</i><a name="FNanchor_511:2_2564" id="FNanchor_511:2_2564"></a><a href="#Footnote_511:2_2564" class="fnanchor">[511:2]</a> (of which we have treated in Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_XX">XX.</a> and
<a href="#CHAPTER_XXXIX">XXXIX.</a>), as well as many other tenets with which we have found the
Christian Church deeply tainted. They held that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To deliver the soul, a captive in darkness, the 'Prince of
Light,' the 'Genius of the Sun,' charged with the redemption
of the intellectual world, of which the Sun is the type,
manifested itself among men; that the light appeared in the
darkness, but the darkness comprehended it not; that, in fact,
light could not unite with darkness; it put on only the
appearance of the human body; that at the crucifixion Christ
Jesus only <i>appeared</i> to suffer. His person having
disappeared, the bystanders saw in his place a cross of light,
over which a celestial voice proclaimed these words; 'The
Cross of Light is called Logos, Christos, the Gate, the Joy.'"</p></div>

<p>Several of the texts of the Gospel histories were quoted with great
plausibility by the Gnostics in support of their doctrine. The story of
Jesus passing through the midst of the Jews when they were about to cast
him headlong from the brow of a hill (Luke iv. 29, 30), and when they
were going to stone him (John iii. 59; x. 31, 39), were examples not
easily refuted.</p>

<p>The Manichean Christian Bishop Faustus expresses himself in the
following manner:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Do you receive the gospel? (ask ye). Undoubtedly I do! Why
then, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>you also admit that Christ was born? Not so; for it by
no means follows that in believing the gospel, I should
therefore believe that Christ was born! Do you then think that
he was of the Virgin Mary? Manes hath said, 'Far be it that I
should ever own that Our Lord Jesus Christ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.'" etc.<a name="FNanchor_512:1_2565" id="FNanchor_512:1_2565"></a><a href="#Footnote_512:1_2565" class="fnanchor">[512:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Tertullian's manner of reasoning on the evidences of Christianity is
also in the same vein, as we saw in our last chapter.<a name="FNanchor_512:2_2566" id="FNanchor_512:2_2566"></a><a href="#Footnote_512:2_2566" class="fnanchor">[512:2]</a></p>

<p>Mr. King, speaking of the Gnostic Christians, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Their chief doctrines had been held for centuries before
(their time) in many of the cities in <i>Asia Minor</i>. There, it
is probable, they first came into existence as <i>Myst&aelig;</i>, upon
the establishment of direct intercourse with <i>India</i>, under
the Seleucid&aelig; and Ptolemies. The college of <i>Essenes</i> and
<i>Megabyz&aelig;</i> at Ephesus, the <i>Orphics</i> of Thrace, the <i>Curets</i>
of Crete, <i>are all merely branches of one antique and common
religion, and that originally Asiatic</i>."<a name="FNanchor_512:3_2567" id="FNanchor_512:3_2567"></a><a href="#Footnote_512:3_2567" class="fnanchor">[512:3]</a></p></div>

<p>These early Christian Mystics are alluded to in several instances in the
New Testament. For example:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come <i>in
the flesh</i> is of God; and every spirit that confesseth not
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God."<a name="FNanchor_512:4_2568" id="FNanchor_512:4_2568"></a><a href="#Footnote_512:4_2568" class="fnanchor">[512:4]</a>
<ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess
not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh."<a name="FNanchor_512:5_2569" id="FNanchor_512:5_2569"></a><a href="#Footnote_512:5_2569" class="fnanchor">[512:5]</a></p></div>

<p>This is language that could not have been used, if the reality of Christ
Jesus' existence as a man could not have been denied, or, it would
certainly seem, if the apostle himself had been able to give any
evidence whatever of the claim.</p>

<p>The quarrels on this subject lasted for a long time among the early
Christians. <i>Hermas</i>, speaking of this, says to the brethren:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Take heed, my children, that your dissensions deprive you not
of your lives. How will ye instruct the elect of God, when ye
yourselves want correction? Wherefore admonish one another,
and be at peace among yourselves; that I, standing before your
father, may give an account of you unto the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_512:6_2570" id="FNanchor_512:6_2570"></a><a href="#Footnote_512:6_2570" class="fnanchor">[512:6]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Ignatius</i>, in his Epistle to the Smyrn&aelig;ans, says:<a name="FNanchor_512:7_2571" id="FNanchor_512:7_2571"></a><a href="#Footnote_512:7_2571" class="fnanchor">[512:7]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Only in the name of Jesus Christ, I undergo all, to suffer
together with him; he who was made a perfect man strengthening
me. <i>Whom some, not knowing, do deny</i>; or rather have been
denied by him, being the advocates of death, rather than of
the truth. Whom neither the prophecies, nor the law of Moses,
have persuaded; <i>nor the Gospel itself even to this day</i>, nor
the sufferings <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>of any one of us. <i>For they think also the
same thing of us</i>; for what does a man profit me, if he shall
praise me, and blaspheme my Lord; <i>not confessing that he was
truly made man</i>?"</p></div>

<p>In his Epistle to the Philadelphians he says:<a name="FNanchor_513:1_2572" id="FNanchor_513:1_2572"></a><a href="#Footnote_513:1_2572" class="fnanchor">[513:1]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have heard of some who say, <i>unless I find it written in
the originals</i>, I will not believe it to be written in the
Gospel. And when I said, It is written, they answered what lay
before them in their corrupted copies."</p></div>

<p><i>Polycarp</i>, in his Epistle to the Philippians, says:<a name="FNanchor_513:2_2573" id="FNanchor_513:2_2573"></a><a href="#Footnote_513:2_2573" class="fnanchor">[513:2]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Whosoever does not confess that Jesus Christ is come in the
flesh, he is Antichrist: <i>and whosoever does not confess his
sufferings upon the cross</i>, is from the devil. And whosoever
perverts the oracles of the Lord to his own lusts; and says
that there shall neither be any resurrection, nor judgment, he
is the first-born of Satan."</p></div>

<p><i>Ignatius</i> says to the Magnesians:<a name="FNanchor_513:3_2574" id="FNanchor_513:3_2574"></a><a href="#Footnote_513:3_2574" class="fnanchor">[513:3]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Be not deceived with strange doctrines; nor with old fables
which are unprofitable. For if we still continue to live
according to the Jewish law, we do confess ourselves <i>not</i> to
have received grace. For even the most holy prophets lived
according to Jesus Christ.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wherefore if they who were
brought up in these ancient laws came nevertheless to the
newness of hope; no longer observing Sabbaths, but keeping the
Lord's Day, in which also our life is sprung up by him, and
through his death, <i>whom yet some deny</i>. By which <i>mystery</i> we
have been brought to believe, and therefore wait that we may
be found the disciples of Jesus Christ, our only master.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
These things, my beloved, I write unto you, not that I know of
any among you <i>that be under this error</i>; but as one of the
least among you, I am desirous to forewarn you that ye fall
not into the snares of vain doctrine."</p></div>

<p>After reading this we can say with the writer of Timothy,<a name="FNanchor_513:4_2575" id="FNanchor_513:4_2575"></a><a href="#Footnote_513:4_2575" class="fnanchor">[513:4]</a>
"Without controversy, great is the <span class="allcapsc">MYSTERY</span> of godliness."</p>

<p>Beside those who denied that Christ Jesus had ever been manifest <i>in the
flesh</i>, there were others who denied that <i>he</i> had been
crucified.<a name="FNanchor_513:5_2576" id="FNanchor_513:5_2576"></a><a href="#Footnote_513:5_2576" class="fnanchor">[513:5]</a> This is seen from the words of Justin Martyr, in his
<i>Apology</i> for the Christian Religion, written <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 141, where he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As to the <i>objection</i> to <i>our</i> Jesus's being crucified, I
say, suffering was common to all the Sons of Jove."<a name="FNanchor_513:6_2577" id="FNanchor_513:6_2577"></a><a href="#Footnote_513:6_2577" class="fnanchor">[513:6]</a></p></div>

<p>This is as much as to say: "<i>You</i> Pagans claim that <i>your</i> incarnate
gods and <i>Saviours</i> suffered and died, then why should not <i>we</i> claim
the same for <i>our</i> Saviour?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span></p><p>The <i>Koran</i>, referring to the <i>Jews</i>, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They have not believed in Jesus, and have spoken against Mary
a grievous calumny, and have said: 'Verily we have slain
Christ Jesus, the son of Mary' (the apostle of God). <i>Yet they
slew him not, neither crucified him, but he was represented by
one in his likeness. And verily they who disagreed concerning
him were in a doubt as to this matter, and had no sure
knowledge thereof, but followed only an uncertain
opinion.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_514:1_2578" id="FNanchor_514:1_2578"></a><a href="#Footnote_514:1_2578" class="fnanchor">[514:1]</a></p></div>

<p>This passage alone, from the Mohammedan Bible, is sufficient to show, if
other evidence were wanting, that the early Christians "disagreed
concerning him," and that "they had no sure knowledge thereof, but
followed only an uncertain opinion."</p>

<p>In the books which are <i>now</i> called <i>Apocryphal</i>, but which <i>were</i> the
most quoted, and of equal authority with the others, and which were
<i>voted not</i> the word of God&mdash;for obvious reasons&mdash;and were therefore
cast out of the canon, we find many allusions to the strife among the
early Christians. For instance; in the "First Epistle of Clement to the
Corinthians,"<a name="FNanchor_514:2_2579" id="FNanchor_514:2_2579"></a><a href="#Footnote_514:2_2579" class="fnanchor">[514:2]</a> we read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Wherefore are there strifes, and anger, and divisions, and
schisms, and wars, among us?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why do we rend and tear in
pieces the members of Christ, and raise seditions against our
own body? and are come to such a height of madness, as to
forget that we are members one of another."</p></div>

<p>In his Epistle to the Trallians, Ignatius says:<a name="FNanchor_514:3_2580" id="FNanchor_514:3_2580"></a><a href="#Footnote_514:3_2580" class="fnanchor">[514:3]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I exhort you, or rather not I, but the love of Jesus Christ,
that ye use none but Christian nourishment; abstaining from
pasture which is of another kind. I mean <i>Heresy</i>. For they
that are heretics, confound together the doctrine of Jesus
Christ with their own poison; whilst they seem worthy of
belief.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Stop your ears, therefore, as often as any one
shall speak contrary to Jesus Christ, who was of the race of
David, of the Virgin Mary. Who was <i>truly</i> born, and did eat
and drink; was <i>truly</i> persecuted under Pontius Pilate; was
<i>truly</i> crucified and dead; both those in heaven and on earth,
and under the earth, being spectators of it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But if, as
some who are atheists, that is to say, infidels, pretend,
<i>that he only seemed to suffer</i>, why then am I bound? Why do I
desire to fight with beasts? Therefore do I die in vain."</p></div>

<p>We find St. Paul, the very first Apostle of the Gentiles, expressly
avowing that <i>he was made a minister of the gospel, which had already
been preached to every creature under heaven</i>,<a name="FNanchor_514:4_2581" id="FNanchor_514:4_2581"></a><a href="#Footnote_514:4_2581" class="fnanchor">[514:4]</a> and preaching <i>a
God manifest in the flesh</i>, who had been <i>believed on in the
world</i>,<a name="FNanchor_514:5_2582" id="FNanchor_514:5_2582"></a><a href="#Footnote_514:5_2582" class="fnanchor">[514:5]</a> therefore, <i>before the commencement of his ministry</i>; and
who could not have been the man of Nazareth, who had certainly not been
preached, <i>at that time</i>, nor generally believed on in the world, till
ages after that time.<a name="FNanchor_514:6_2583" id="FNanchor_514:6_2583"></a><a href="#Footnote_514:6_2583" class="fnanchor">[514:6]</a> We find also that:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span></p><p>1. This Paul owns himself a <i>deacon</i>, the lowest ecclesiastical grade
of the <i>Therapeutan</i> church.</p>

<p>2. The Gospel of which these Epistles speak, had been extensively
preached and fully established before the time of Jesus, by the
Therapeuts or Essenes, who believed in the doctrine of the
Angel-Messiah, the &AElig;on from heaven.<a name="FNanchor_515:1_2584" id="FNanchor_515:1_2584"></a><a href="#Footnote_515:1_2584" class="fnanchor">[515:1]</a></p>

<p>Leo the Great, so-called (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 440-461), writes thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Let those who with impious murmurings find fault with the
Divine dispensations, and who complain about the <i>lateness</i> of
our Lord's nativity, cease from their grievances, as if what
was <i>carried out</i> in later ages of the world, had not been
impending <i>in time past</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"What the Apostles preached, the prophets (in Israel) had
announced before, and what has <i>always been (universally)
believed</i>, cannot be said to have been <i>fulfilled</i> too late.
By this delay of his work of salvation, the wisdom and love of
God have only made us more fitted for his call; so that, <i>what
had been announced before by many Signs and Words and
Mysteries during so many centuries</i>, should not be doubtful or
uncertain in the days of the gospel.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. God has not provided
for the interests of men by a <i>new council</i> or by a <i>late
compassion</i>; but he had instituted from the beginning for all
men, <i>one and the same path of salvation</i>."<a name="FNanchor_515:2_2585" id="FNanchor_515:2_2585"></a><a href="#Footnote_515:2_2585" class="fnanchor">[515:2]</a></p></div>

<p>This is equivalent to saying that, "God, in his '<i>late compassion</i>,' has
sent his Son, Christ Jesus, to save <i>us</i>, therefore do not complain or
'murmur' about 'the lateness of his coming,' for the Lord has already
provided for those who <i>preceded us</i>; he has given them '<i>the same path
of salvation</i>' by sending to <i>them</i>, as he has sent to <i>us</i>, a
<i>Redeemer</i> and a <i>Saviour</i>."</p>

<p>Justin Martyr, in his dialogue with Typho,<a name="FNanchor_515:3_2586" id="FNanchor_515:3_2586"></a><a href="#Footnote_515:3_2586" class="fnanchor">[515:3]</a> makes a similar
confession (as we have <a href="#Justin_Martyr_quote">already seen</a> in our last chapter), wherein he
says that there exists not a people, civilized or semi-civilized, who
have not offered up prayers in the name of a <i>crucified Saviour</i> to the
Father and Creator of all things.</p>

<p>Add to this medley the fact that St. Iren&aelig;us (<span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 192), one of the
most celebrated, most respected, and most quoted of the early Christian
Fathers, tells us on the authority of his master, Polycarp, who had it
from St. John himself, and from all the old people of Asia, that Jesus
was not crucified at the time stated in the Gospels, but that he lived
to be nearly <i>fifty</i> years old. The passage which, most fortunately, has
escaped the destroyers of all such evidence, is to be found in Iren&aelig;us'
second book against heresies,<a name="FNanchor_515:4_2587" id="FNanchor_515:4_2587"></a><a href="#Footnote_515:4_2587" class="fnanchor">[515:4]</a> of which the following is a
portion:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"As the chief part of thirty years belongs to youth, and
every one will confess him to be such till the fortieth year:
but from the fortieth year to the fiftieth he declines into
old age, <i>which our Lord (Jesus) having attained he taught us
the Gospel, and all the elders who, in Asia, assembled with
John, the disciple of the Lord, testify; and as John himself
had taught them</i>. And he (John?) remained with them till the
time of Trajan. And some of them saw not only John but other
Apostles, <i>and heard the same thing from them, and bear the
same testimony to this revelation</i>."</p></div>

<p>The escape of this passage from the destroyers can be accounted for only
in the same way as the <a href="#Minucius_Felix_quote">passage</a> of Minucius Felix (quoted in Chapter XX.)
concerning the Pagans worshiping a crucifix. These two passages escaped
from among, probably, hundreds destroyed, of which we know nothing,
under the decrees of the emperors, yet remaining, by which they were
ordered to be destroyed.</p>

<p>In John viii. 56, Jesus is made to say to the Jews: "Your father Abraham
rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it and was glad." Then said the Jews
unto him: "Thou art not yet <i>fifty</i> years old, and hast thou seen
Abraham?"</p>

<p>If Jesus was then but about <i>thirty</i> years of age, the Jews would
evidently have said: "thou art not yet <i>forty</i> years old," and would not
have been likely to say: "thou art not yet <i>fifty</i> years old," unless he
was past forty.</p>

<p>There was a tradition current among the early Christians, that <i>Annas</i>
was high-priest when Jesus was crucified. This is evident from the
<i>Acts</i>.<a name="FNanchor_516:1_2588" id="FNanchor_516:1_2588"></a><a href="#Footnote_516:1_2588" class="fnanchor">[516:1]</a> Now, Annas, or Ananias, <i>was not high-priest until about
the year 48 <span class="stressed">a. d.</span></i>;<a name="FNanchor_516:2_2589" id="FNanchor_516:2_2589"></a><a href="#Footnote_516:2_2589" class="fnanchor">[516:2]</a> therefore, if Jesus was crucified at that
time he must have been about <i>fifty</i> years of age;<a name="FNanchor_516:3_2590" id="FNanchor_516:3_2590"></a><a href="#Footnote_516:3_2590" class="fnanchor">[516:3]</a> but, as we
remarked elsewhere, there exists, outside of the New Testament, no
evidence whatever, in book, inscription, or monument, that Jesus of
Nazareth was either scourged or crucified under Pontius Pilate.
Josephus, Tacitus, Plinius, Philo, nor any of their contemporaries, ever
refer to the fact of this crucifixion, or express any belief
thereon.<a name="FNanchor_516:4_2591" id="FNanchor_516:4_2591"></a><a href="#Footnote_516:4_2591" class="fnanchor">[516:4]</a> In the Talmud&mdash;the book containing Jewish
traditions&mdash;Jesus is not referred to as the "crucified one," but as the
"hanged one,"<a name="FNanchor_516:5_2592" id="FNanchor_516:5_2592"></a><a href="#Footnote_516:5_2592" class="fnanchor">[516:5]</a> while elsewhere it is narrated he was <i>stoned</i> to
death; so that it is evident they were ignorant of the manner of death
which he suffered.<a name="FNanchor_516:6_2593" id="FNanchor_516:6_2593"></a><a href="#Footnote_516:6_2593" class="fnanchor">[516:6]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>In <i>Sanhedr. 43 a</i>, Jesus it said to have had five disciples, among
whom were Mattheaus and Thaddeus. He is called "That Man," "The
Nazarine," "The Fool," and "The Hung." Thus Aben Ezra says that
Constantine put on his <i>labarum</i> "a figure of the hung;" and, according
to R. Bechai, the Christians were called "Worshipers of the Hung."</p>

<p>Little is said about Jesus in the <i>Talmud</i>, except that he was a scholar
of Joshua Ben Perachiah (who lived a century before the time assigned by
the Christians for the birth of Jesus), accompanied him into Egypt,
there learned magic, and was a seducer of the people, and was finally
put to death by being stoned, and then hung as a blasphemer.</p>

<p>"The conclusion is, that no clearly defined traces of the personal Jesus
remain on the surface, or beneath the surface, of Christendom. The
silence of Josephus and other secular historians may be accounted for
without falling back on a theory of hostility or contempt.<a name="FNanchor_517:1_2594" id="FNanchor_517:1_2594"></a><a href="#Footnote_517:1_2594" class="fnanchor">[517:1]</a> The
<i>Christ</i>-idea cannot be spared from Christian development, but the
personal Jesus, in some measure, can be."</p>

<p>"The person of Jesus, though it may have been immense, is indistinct.
That a great character was there may be conceded; but precisely wherein
the character was great, is left to our <i>conjecture</i>. Of the eminent
persons who have swayed the spiritual destinies of mankind, none has
more completely disappeared from the critical view. The ideal image
which Christians have, for nearly two thousand years, worshiped under
the name of Jesus, has no authentic, distinctly visible, counterpart in
history."</p>

<p>"His followers have gone on with the process of idealization, placing
him higher and higher; making his personal existence more and more
essential; insisting more and more urgently on the necessity of private
intercourse with him; letting the Father subside into the background, as
an 'effluence,' and the Holy Ghost lapse from individual identity into
impersonal influence, in order that he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>might be all in all as
Regenerator and Saviour. From age to age the personal Jesus has been
made the object of an extreme adoration, till now <i>faith</i> in the living
Christ is the heart of the Gospel; philosophy, science, culture,
humanity are thrust resolutely aside, and the great teachers of the age
are extinguished in order that <i>his</i> light may shine." But, as Mr.
Frothingham remarks, in "The Cradle of the Christ": "In the order of
experience, historical and biographical truth is discovered by stripping
off layer after layer of exaggeration, and going back to the statements
of contemporaries. As a rule, figures are <i>reduced</i>, not enlarged, by
criticism. The influence of admiration is recognized as distorting and
falsifying, while exalting. The process of legend-making begins
immediately, goes on rapidly and with accelerating speed, and must be
liberally allowed for by the seeker after truth. In scores of instances
the historical individual turns out to be very much smaller than he was
painted by his terrified or loving worshipers. In no single case has it
been established that he was greater, or as great. It is, no doubt,
conceivable that such a case should occur, but it never has occurred, in
known instances, and cannot be presumed to have occurred in any
particular instance. The presumptions are against the correctness of the
glorified image. The disposition to exaggerate is so much stronger than
the disposition to underrate, that even really great men are placed
higher than they belong oftener than lower. The historical method works
backwards. Knowledge shrinks the man."<a name="FNanchor_518:1_2595" id="FNanchor_518:1_2595"></a><a href="#Footnote_518:1_2595" class="fnanchor">[518:1]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>As we are allowed to <i>conjecture</i> as to what is true in the Gospel
history, we shall now do so.</p>

<p>The death of Herod, which occurred a few years before the time assigned
for the birth of Jesus, was followed by frightful social and political
convulsions in Judea. For two or three years all the elements of
disorder were abroad. Between pretenders to the vacant throne of Herod,
<i>and aspirants to the Messianic throne of David</i>, Judea was torn and
devastated. Revolt assumed the wildest form, the higher enthusiasm of
faith yielded to the lower fury of <i>fanaticism</i>; the celestial visions
of a kingdom of heaven were completely banished by the smoke and flame
of political hate. <i>Claimant after claimant of the dangerous supremacy
of the Messiah appeared, pitched a camp in the wilderness, raised the
banner, gathered a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>force, was attacked, defeated, banished or
crucified</i>; but <i>the frenzy did not abate</i>.</p>

<p>The popular aspect of the Messianic hope was <i>political</i>, not religious
or moral. The name <i>Messiah</i> was synonymous with <i>King of the Jews</i>; it
suggested <i>political designs and aspirations</i>. The assumption of that
character by any individual drew on him the vigilance of the police.</p>

<p>That Jesus of Nazareth assumed the character of "<i>Messiah</i>," as did many
before and after him, and that his crucifixion<a name="FNanchor_520:1_2596" id="FNanchor_520:1_2596"></a><a href="#Footnote_520:1_2596" class="fnanchor">[520:1]</a> was simply an act
of the law on <i>political grounds</i>, just as it was in the case of other
so-called <i>Messiahs</i>, we believe to be the truth of the matter.<a name="FNanchor_520:2_2597" id="FNanchor_520:2_2597"></a><a href="#Footnote_520:2_2597" class="fnanchor">[520:2]</a>
"He is represented as being a native of <i>Galilee</i>, the <i>insurgent
district of the country</i>; nurtured, if not born, in Nazareth, one of its
chief cities; reared as a youth amid traditions of patriotic devotion,
and amid scenes associated with heroic dreams and endeavors. The
Galileans were restless, excitable people, beyond the reach of
conventionalities, remote from the centre of power, ecclesiastical and
secular, simple in their lives, bold of speech, independent in thought,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>thoroughgoing in the sort of radicalism that is common among people who
live 'out of the world,' who have leisure to discuss the exciting topics
of the day, but too little knowledge, culture, or sense of social
responsibility to discuss them soundly. Their mental discontent and
moral intractability were proverbial. They were belligerents. The Romans
had more trouble with them than with the natives of any other province.
<i>The Messiahs all started out from Galilee, and never failed to collect
followers round their standard.</i> The Galileans, more than others, lived
in the anticipation of the Deliverer. The reference of the Messiah to
Galilee is therefore already an indication of the character he is to
assume."</p>

<p>To show the state the country must have been in at that time, we will
quote an incident or two from Josephus.</p>

<p>A religious enthusiast called the Samaritans together upon Mount
Gerizim, and assured them that he would work a miracle. "So they came
thither <i>armed</i>, and thought the discourse of the man probable; and as
they abode at a certain village, which was called Tirathaba, they got
the rest together of them, and desired to go up the mountain in a great
multitude together: but Pilate prevented their going up, by seizing upon
the roads by a great band of horsemen and footmen, who fell upon those
who were gotten together in the village; and when it came to an action,
some of them they slew, and others of them they put to flight, and took
a great many alive, the principal of whom, and also the most potent of
those that fled away, Pilate ordered to be slain."<a name="FNanchor_521:1_2598" id="FNanchor_521:1_2598"></a><a href="#Footnote_521:1_2598" class="fnanchor">[521:1]</a></p>

<p>Not long before this Pilate pillaged the temple treasury, and used the
"sacred money" to bring a current of water to Jerusalem. The <i>Jews</i> were
displeased with this, "and many ten thousands of the people got together
and made a clamor against him. Some of them used reproaches, and abused
the man, as crowds of such people usually do. So he habited a great
number of his soldiers in their habits, who carried daggers under their
garments, and sent them to a place where they might surround them. So he
bade the Jews himself go away; but they boldly casting reproaches upon
him, he gave the soldiers that signal which had been beforehand agreed
on; who laid upon them with much greater blows than Pilate had commanded
them, and equally punished those that were tumultuous, and those that
were not; nor did they spare them in the least: and since the people
were unarmed, and were caught by men prepared for what they were about,
there were a great number <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>of them slain by this means, and others ran
away wounded. And thus an end was put to this sedition."<a name="FNanchor_522:1_2599" id="FNanchor_522:1_2599"></a><a href="#Footnote_522:1_2599" class="fnanchor">[522:1]</a></p>

<p>It was such deeds as these, inflicted upon the Jews by their oppressors,
that made them think of the promised Messiah who was to deliver them
from bondage, and which made many zealous fanatics imagine themselves to
be "He who should come."<a name="FNanchor_522:2_2600" id="FNanchor_522:2_2600"></a><a href="#Footnote_522:2_2600" class="fnanchor">[522:2]</a></p>

<p>There is reason to believe, as we have said, that Jesus of Nazareth
assumed the title of "<i>Messiah</i>." His age was throbbing and bursting
with suppressed energy. The pressure of the Roman Empire was required to
keep it down. "The Messianic hope had such vitality that it condensed
into moments the moral result of ages. The common people were watching
to see the heavens open, interpreted peals of thunder as angel voices,
and saw divine potents in the flight of birds. Mothers dreamed their
boys would be Messiah. The wildest preacher drew a crowd. The heart of
the nation swelled big with the conviction that the hour of destiny was
about to strike, that the kingdom of heaven was at hand. <i>The crown was
ready for any kingly head that might assume it.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_522:3_2601" id="FNanchor_522:3_2601"></a><a href="#Footnote_522:3_2601" class="fnanchor">[522:3]</a></p>

<p>The actions of this man, throughout his public career, we believe to be
those of a zealot whose zeal overrode considerations of wisdom; in fact,
a Galilean fanatic. Pilate condemns him reluctantly, feeling that he is
a harmless visionary, but is obliged to condemn him as one of the many
who persistently claimed to be the "<i>Messiah</i>," or "<i>King of the Jews</i>,"
an enemy of C&aelig;sar, an instrument against the empire, a pretender to the
throne, a bold inciter to rebellion. The death he undergoes is the death
of the traitor and mutineer,<a name="FNanchor_522:4_2602" id="FNanchor_522:4_2602"></a><a href="#Footnote_522:4_2602" class="fnanchor">[522:4]</a> the death that was inflicted on many
such claimants, the death that would have been decreed to Judas the
Galilean,<a name="FNanchor_522:5_2603" id="FNanchor_522:5_2603"></a><a href="#Footnote_522:5_2603" class="fnanchor">[522:5]</a> had he been captured, and that was inflicted on
thousands of his deluded followers. <i>It was the Romans, then, who
crucified the man Jesus, and not the Jews.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>"In the Roman law the <i>State</i> is the main object, for which the
individual must live and die, with or against his will. In Jewish law,
the <i>person</i> is made the main object, for which the State must live and
die; because the fundamental idea of the Roman law is power, and the
fundamental idea of Jewish law is justice."<a name="FNanchor_523:1_2604" id="FNanchor_523:1_2604"></a><a href="#Footnote_523:1_2604" class="fnanchor">[523:1]</a> <i>Therefore Caiaphas
and his conspirators did not act from the Jewish standpoint.</i> They
represented <i>Rome</i>, her principles, interest, and barbarous
caprices.<a name="FNanchor_523:2_2605" id="FNanchor_523:2_2605"></a><a href="#Footnote_523:2_2605" class="fnanchor">[523:2]</a> Not one point in the whole trial agrees with Jewish
laws and custom.<a name="FNanchor_523:3_2606" id="FNanchor_523:3_2606"></a><a href="#Footnote_523:3_2606" class="fnanchor">[523:3]</a> It is impossible to save it; it must be given up
as a transparent and unskilled invention of a <i>Gentile Christian</i>, who
knew nothing of Jewish law and custom, and was ignorant of the state of
civilization in Palestine, in the time of Jesus.</p>

<p>Jesus had been proclaimed the "<i>Messiah</i>," the "<i>Ruler of the Jews</i>,"
and the restorer of the kingdom of heaven. No Roman ear could understand
these pretensions, otherwise than in their rebellious sense. That
Pontius Pilate certainly understood under the title, "<i>Messiah</i>," the
king (the political chief of the nation), is evident from the
subscription of the cross, "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews," which
he did not remove in spite of all protestations of the Jews. There is
only one point in which the <i>four</i> Gospels agree, and that is, that
early in the morning Jesus was delivered over to the <i>Roman governor</i>,
Pilate; that he was accused of high-treason against <i>Rome</i>&mdash;having been
proclaimed King of the Jews&mdash;and that in consequence thereof he was
condemned first to be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>scourged, and then to be crucified; all of which
was done in hot haste. <i>In all other points the narratives of the
Evangelists differ widely</i>, and so essentially that one story cannot be
made of the four accounts; nor can any particular points stand the test
of historical criticism, and vindicate its substantiality as a fact.</p>

<p>The Jews could not have crucified Jesus, <i>according to their laws</i>, if
they had inflicted on him the highest penalty of the law, since
crucifixion was <i>exclusively Roman</i>.<a name="FNanchor_524:1_2607" id="FNanchor_524:1_2607"></a><a href="#Footnote_524:1_2607" class="fnanchor">[524:1]</a> If the priests, elders,
Pharisees, Jews, or all of them wanted Jesus out of the way so badly,
why did they not have him quietly put to death while he was in their
power, and done at once. The writer of the fourth Gospel seems to have
understood this difficulty, and informs us that they could not kill him,
<i>because he had prophesied what death he should die</i>; so he could die no
other. It was dire necessity, that the heathen symbol of life and
immortality&mdash;the cross<a name="FNanchor_524:2_2608" id="FNanchor_524:2_2608"></a><a href="#Footnote_524:2_2608" class="fnanchor">[524:2]</a>&mdash;should be brought to honor among the
early Christians, and Jesus had to die on the cross (the Roman Gibbet),
<i>according to John</i><a name="FNanchor_524:3_2609" id="FNanchor_524:3_2609"></a><a href="#Footnote_524:3_2609" class="fnanchor">[524:3]</a> simply because it was so <i>prophesied</i>. The
fact is, the crucifixion story, like the symbol of the crucifix itself,
<i>came from abroad</i>.<a name="FNanchor_524:4_2610" id="FNanchor_524:4_2610"></a><a href="#Footnote_524:4_2610" class="fnanchor">[524:4]</a> It was told with the avowed intention of
exonerating the Romans, and criminating the Jews, so they make the Roman
governor take water, "and wash his hands before the multitude, saying,
<i>I</i> am innocent of the blood of this <i>just person</i>: see <i>ye</i> to it." To
be sure of their case, they make the Jews say: "<i>His blood be on us, and
on our children.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_524:5_2611" id="FNanchor_524:5_2611"></a><a href="#Footnote_524:5_2611" class="fnanchor">[524:5]</a></p>

<p>"Another fact is this. Just at the period of time when misfortune and
ruination befell the Jews most severely, in the first post-apostolic
generation, the Christians were most active in making proselytes among
Gentiles. To have then preached that <i>a crucified Jewish Rabbi of
Galilee</i> was their Saviour, would have sounded supremely ridiculous to
those heathens. To have added thereto, that the said Rabbi was crucified
by command of a Roman Governor, because he had been proclaimed 'King of
the Jews,' would have been fatal to the whole scheme. In the opinion of
the vulgar heathen, where the Roman Governor and Jewish Rabbi came in
conflict, the former must unquestionably be right, and the latter
decidedly wrong. To have preached a Saviour who was justly condemned to
die the death of a slave and villain, would certainly have proved fatal
to the whole enterprise. Therefore it was necessary <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>to exonerate Pilate
and the Romans, and to throw the whole burden upon the Jews, in order to
establish the innocence and martyrdom of Jesus in the heathen mind."</p>

<p>That the crucifixion story, as related in the synoptic Gospels, was
written <i>abroad</i>, and <i>not</i> in the Hebrew, or in the dialect spoken by
the Hebrews of Palestine, is evident from the following particular
points, noticed by Dr. Isaac M. Wise, a learned Hebrew scholar:</p>

<p>The <i>Mark</i> and <i>Matthew</i> narrators call the place of crucifixion
"<i>Golgotha</i>," to which the Mark narrator adds, "which is, being
interpreted, <i>the place of skulls</i>." The Matthew narrator adds the same
interpretation, which the John narrator copies without the word
"<i>Golgotha</i>," and adds, <i>it was a place near Jerusalem</i>. The Luke
narrator calls the place of crucifixion "<i>Calvary</i>," which is the <span class="smcap">Latin</span>
<i>Calvaria</i>, viz., "<i>the place of bare skulls</i>." Therefore the name does
not refer to the form of the hill, <i>but to the bare skulls upon
it</i>.<a name="FNanchor_525:1_2612" id="FNanchor_525:1_2612"></a><a href="#Footnote_525:1_2612" class="fnanchor">[525:1]</a> Now "<i>there is no such word as <span class="stressed">Golgotha</span> anywhere in Jewish
literature, and there is no such place mentioned anywhere near Jerusalem
or in Palestine by any writer</i>; and, in fact, there was no such place;
there could have been none near Jerusalem. The Jews buried their dead
carefully. Also the executed convict had to be buried before night. No
bare skulls, bleaching in the sun, could be found in Palestine,
especially not near Jerusalem. <i>It was law, that a bare skull, the bare
spinal column, and also the imperfect skeleton of any human being, make
man unclean by contact, and also by having either in the house.</i> Man,
thus made unclean, could not eat of any sacrificial meal, or of the
sacred tithe, before he had gone through the ceremonies of purification;
and whatever he touched was also unclean (Maimonides, Hil. Tumath Meth.,
iii. 1). Any impartial reader can see that the object of this law was to
prevent the barbarous practice of heathens of having human skulls and
skeletons lie about exposed to the decomposing influences of the
atmosphere, as the Romans did in Palestine after the fall of Bethar,
when for a long time they would give no permission to bury the dead
patriots. This law was certainly enforced most rigidly in the vicinity
of Jerusalem, of which they maintained "Jerusalem is more holy than all
other cities surrounded with walls," so that it was not permitted to
keep a dead body over night in the city, or to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>transport through it
human bones. Jerusalem was the place of the sacrificial meals and the
consumption of the sacred tithe, which was considered very holy
(Maimonides, Hil. Beth Habchirah, vii. 14); there, and in the
surroundings, skulls and skeletons were certainly never seen on the
surface of the earth, and consequently there was no place called
"<i>Golgotha</i>," and there was no such word in the Hebrew dialect. It is a
word coined by the Mark narrator to translate the Latin term
"<i>Calvaria</i>," which, together with the crucifixion story, <i>came from
Rome</i>. But after the Syrian word was made, nobody understood it, and the
Mark narrator was obliged to expound it."<a name="FNanchor_526:1_2613" id="FNanchor_526:1_2613"></a><a href="#Footnote_526:1_2613" class="fnanchor">[526:1]</a></p>

<p>In the face of the arguments produced, the crucifixion story, as related
in the Gospels, cannot be upheld as an historical fact. There exists,
certainly, no rational ground whatever for the belief that the affair
took place <i>in the manner the Evangelists describe it</i>. All that can be
saved of the whole story is, that after Jesus had answered the first
question before Pilate, viz., "Art thou the King of the Jews?" which it
is natural to suppose he was asked, and also this can be supposed only,
he was given over to the Roman soldiers to be disposed of as soon as
possible, before his admirers and followers could come to his rescue, or
any demonstration in his favor be made. He was captured in the night, as
quietly as possible, and guarded in some place, probably in the
high-priest's court, completely secluded from the eyes of the populace;
and early in the morning he was brought before Pilate as cautiously and
quietly as it could be done, and at <i>his</i> command, disposed of by the
soldiers as quickly as practicable, and in a manner not known to the
mass of the people. All this was done, most likely, while the multitude
worshiped on Mount Moriah, and nobody had an intimation of the tragical
end of the Man of Nazareth.</p>

<p>The bitter cry of Jesus, as he hung on the tree, "My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me?" disclosed the hope of deliverance that till the
last moment sustained his heart, and betrayed the anguish felt when the
hope was blighted; the sneers and hooting of the Roman soldiers
expressed their conviction that he had pretended to be what he was not.</p>

<p>The miracles ascribed to him, and the moral precepts put into his mouth,
in after years, are what might be expected; history was simply repeating
itself; the same thing had been done for others. "The preacher of the
Mount, the prophet of the Beatitudes, does <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>but repeat, with persuasive
lips, what the law-givers of his race proclaimed in mighty tones of
command."<a name="FNanchor_527:1_2614" id="FNanchor_527:1_2614"></a><a href="#Footnote_527:1_2614" class="fnanchor">[527:1]</a></p>

<p>The martyrdom of Jesus of Nazareth has been gratefully acknowledged by
his disciples, whose lives he saved by the sacrifice of his own, and by
their friends, who would have fallen by the score had he not prevented
the rebellion ripe at Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_527:2_2615" id="FNanchor_527:2_2615"></a><a href="#Footnote_527:2_2615" class="fnanchor">[527:2]</a> Posterity, infatuated with Pagan
apotheoses, made of that simple martyrdom an interesting legend, colored
with the myths of resurrection and ascension to that very heaven which
the telescope has put out of man's way. It is a novel myth, made to suit
the gross conceptions of ex-heathens. Modern theology, understanding
well enough that the myth cannot be saved, seeks refuge in the greatness
and self-denial of the man who died for an idea, as though Jesus had
been the only man who had died for an idea. Thousands, tens of thousands
of Jews, Christians, Mohammedans and Heathens, have died for ideas, and
some of them were very foolish. But Jesus did not die for an idea. He
never advanced anything new, that we know of, to die for. He was not
accused of saying or teaching anything <i>original</i>. Nobody has ever been
able to discover anything new and original in the Gospels. He evidently
died to save the lives of his friends, and this is much more meritorious
than if he had died for a questionable idea. But then the whole fabric
of vicarious atonement is demolished, and modern theology cannot get
over the absurdity that the Almighty Lord of the Universe, the infinite
and eternal cause of all causes, had to kill some innocent person in
order to be reconciled to the human race. However abstractly they
speculate and subtilize, there is always an undigested bone of man-god,
god-man, and vicarious atonement in the theological stomach. Therefore
theology appears so ridiculous in the eyes of modern philosophy. The
theological speculation cannot go far enough to hold pace with modern
astronomy. However nicely the idea may be dressed, the great God of the
immense universe looks too small upon the cross of Calvary; and the
human family is too large, has too numerous virtues and vices, to be
perfectly represented by, and dependent on, one Rabbi of Galilee.
Speculate as they may, one way or another, they must connect the Eternal
and the fate of the human family with the person and fate of Jesus. That
is the very thing which deprives Jesus of his crown of martyrdom, and
brings <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>religion in perpetual conflict with philosophy. It was not the
religious idea which was crucified in Jesus and resurrected with him, as
with all its martyrs; although his belief in immortality may have
strengthened him in the agony of death. It was the idea of duty to his
disciples and friends which led him to the realms of death. This
deserves admiration, but no more. It demonstrates the nobility of human
nature, but proves nothing in regard to providence, or the providential
scheme of government.</p>

<p>The Christian story, <i>as the Gospels narrate it</i>, cannot stand the test
of criticism. You approach it critically and it falls. <i>Dogmatic
Christology</i> built upon it, has, therefore, a very frail foundation.
Most so-called lives of Christ, or biographies of Jesus, are works of
fiction, erected by imagination on the shifting foundation of meagre and
unreliable records. There are very few passages in the Gospels which can
stand the rigid application of honest criticism. In modern science and
philosophy, orthodox <i>Christology</i> is out of the question.</p>

<p>"This 'sacred tradition' has in itself a glorious vitality, which
Christians may unblameably entitle immortal. But it certainly will not
lose in beauty, grandeur, or truth, if all the details concerning Jesus
which are current in the Gospels, and all the mythology of his person,
be forgotten or discredited. Christianity will remain without Christ.</p>

<p>"This formula has in it nothing paradoxical. Rightly interpreted, it
simply means: <i>All that is best in Jud&aelig;o-Christian sentiment, moral or
spiritual, will survive, without Rabbinical fancies, cultured by
perverse logic; without huge piles of fable built upon them: without the
Oriental Satan, a formidable rival to the throne of God; without the
Pagan invention of Hell and Devils</i>."</p>

<p>In modern criticism, the Gospel sources become so utterly worthless and
unreliable, that it takes more than ordinary faith to believe a large
portion thereof to be true. The <i>Eucharist</i> was not established by
Jesus, and cannot be called a sacrament. The trials of Jesus are
positively not true: they are pure inventions.<a name="FNanchor_528:1_2616" id="FNanchor_528:1_2616"></a><a href="#Footnote_528:1_2616" class="fnanchor">[528:1]</a> The crucifixion
story, <i>as narrated</i>, is certainly not true, and it is extremely
difficult to save the bare fact that Jesus was crucified. What can the
critic do with books in which a few facts must be ingeniously guessed
from under the mountain of ghost stories,<a name="FNanchor_528:2_2617" id="FNanchor_528:2_2617"></a><a href="#Footnote_528:2_2617" class="fnanchor">[528:2]</a> childish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>miracles,<a name="FNanchor_529:1_2618" id="FNanchor_529:1_2618"></a><a href="#Footnote_529:1_2618" class="fnanchor">[529:1]</a> and dogmatic tendencies?<a name="FNanchor_529:2_2619" id="FNanchor_529:2_2619"></a><a href="#Footnote_529:2_2619" class="fnanchor">[529:2]</a> It is absurd to expect
of him to regard them as sources of religious instruction, in preference
to any other mythologies and legends. That is the point at which modern
critics have arrived, therefore, the Gospels have become books for the
museum and arch&aelig;ologist, for students of mythology and ancient
literature.</p>

<p>The spirit of dogmatic Christology hovers still over a portion of
civilized society, in antic organizations, disciplines, and hereditary
forms of faith and worship; in science and philosophy, in the realm of
criticism, its day is past. The universal, religious, and ethical
element of Christianity has no connection whatever with Jesus or his
apostles, with the Gospel, or the Gospel story; <i>it exists independent
of any person or story</i>. Therefore it needs neither the Gospel story nor
its heroes. If we profit by the example, by the teachings, or the
discoveries of men of past ages, to these men we are indebted, and are
in duty bound to acknowledge our indebtedness; but why should we give to
<i>one</i> individual, Jesus of Nazareth, the credit of it <i>all</i>? It is true,
that by selecting from the Gospels whatever portions one may choose, a
<i>common practice among Christian writers</i>, a noble and grand character
may be depicted, <i>but who was the original of this character</i>? We may
find the same individual outside of the Gospels, and before the time of
Jesus. The moral precepts of the Gospels, also, were in existence before
the Gospels themselves were in existence.<a name="FNanchor_529:3_2620" id="FNanchor_529:3_2620"></a><a href="#Footnote_529:3_2620" class="fnanchor">[529:3]</a> Why, then, extol the
hero of the Gospels, and forget all others?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>As it was at the end of Roman Paganism, so is it now: the masses are
deceived and fooled, or do it for themselves, and persons of vivacious
fantasies prefer the masquerade of delusion, to the simple sublimity of
naked but majestic truth. The decline of the church as a political power
proves beyond a doubt the decline of Christian faith. The conflicts of
Church and State all over the European continent, and the hostility
between intelligence and <i>dogmatic Christianity</i>, demonstrates the death
of <i>Christology</i> in the consciousness of modern culture. It is useless
to shut our eyes to these facts. Like rabbinical Judaism, dogmatic
Christianity was the product of ages without typography, telescopes,
microscopes, telegraphs, and power of steam. "These right arms of
intelligence have fought the titanic battles, conquered and demolished
the ancient castles, and remove now the d&eacute;bris, preparing the ground
upon which there shall be the gorgeous temple of humanity, one universal
republic, one universal religion of intelligence, and one great
universal brotherhood. This is the new covenant, the gospel of humanity
and reason."</p>

there existed, in the time of Herod, among the Roman Syrian heathens, a
wide-spread and deep sympathy for a "<i>Crucified King of the Jews</i>." This
was the youngest son of Aristobul, the heroic Maccabee. In the year 43
<span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span>, we find this young man&mdash;<i>Antigonus</i>&mdash;in Palestine claiming the
crown, his cause having been declared just by Julius C&aelig;sar. Allied with
the Parthians, he maintained himself in his royal position for six years
against Herod and Mark Antony. At last, after a heroic life and reign,
he fell in the hands of this Roman. "<i>Antony now gave the kingdom to a
certain Herod, and, having stretched Antigonus on a cross and scourged
him, a thing never done before to any other king by the Romans, he put
him to death.</i>" (Dio Cassius, book xlix. p. 405.)</p>

<p>The fact that all prominent historians of those days mention this
extraordinary occurrence, and the manner they did it, show that it was
considered one of Mark Antony's worst crimes: and that the sympathy with
the "Crucified King" was wide-spread and profound. (See The Martyrdom of
Jesus of Nazareth, p. 106.)</p>

<p>Some writers think that there is a connection between this and the
Gospel story; that they, in a certain measure, put Jesus in the place of

the case of <i>Joseph Smith</i>, in our own time and country, will suffice.</p>

<p>The Mormons regard him very much as Christians regard Jesus; as the
Mohammedans do Mohammed; or as the Buddhists do Buddha. A coarse sort of
religious feeling and fervor appears to have been in Smith's nature. He
seems, from all accounts, to have been cracked on theology, as so many
zealots have been, and cracked to such an extent that his early
acquaintances regarded him as a downright fanatic.</p>

<p>The common view that he was an impostor is not sustained by what is
known of him. He was, in all probability, of unbalanced mind, a
monomaniac, as most prophets have been; but there is no reason to think
that he did not believe in himself, and substantially in what he taught.
He has declared that, when he was about fifteen, he began to reflect on
the importance of being prepared for a future state. He went from one
church to another without finding anything to satisfy the hunger of his
soul, consequently, he retired into himself; he sought solitude; he
spent hours and days in meditation and prayer, after the true manner of
all accredited saints, and was soon repaid by the visits of angels. One
of these came to him when he was but eighteen years old, and the house
in which he was seemed filled with consuming fire. The presence&mdash;he
styles it a personage&mdash;had a pace like lightning, and proclaimed himself
to be an angel of the Lord. He vouchsafed to Smith a vast deal of highly
important information of a celestial order. He told him that his
(Smith's) prayers had been heard, and his sins forgiven; that the
covenant which the Almighty had made with the old Jews was to be
fulfilled; that the introductory work for the second coming of Christ
was now to begin; that the hour for the preaching of the gospel in its
purity to all peoples was at hand, and that Smith was to be an
instrument in the hands of God, to further the divine purpose in the new
dispensation. The celestial stranger also furnished him with a sketch of
the origin, progress, laws and civilization of the American aboriginals,
and declared that the blessing of heaven had finally been withdrawn from
them. To Smith was communicated the momentous circumstance that certain
plates containing an abridgment of the records of the aboriginals and
ancient prophets, who had lived on this continent, were hidden in a hill
near Palmyra. The prophet was counseled to go there and look at them,
and did so. Not being holy enough to possess them as yet, he passed some
months in spiritual probation, after which the records were put into his
keeping. These had been prepared, it is claimed, by a prophet called
Mormon, who had been ordained by God for the purpose, and to conceal
them until he should produce them for the benefit of the faithful, and
unite them with the Bible for the achievement of his will. They form the
celebrated Book of Mormon&mdash;whence the name Mormon&mdash;and are esteemed by
the Latter-Day Saints as of equal authority with the Old and New
Testaments, and as an indispensable supplement thereto, because they
include God's disclosures to the Mormon world. These precious records
were sealed up and deposited <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 420 in the place where Smith had
viewed them by the direction of the angel.</p>

<p>The records were, it is held, in the reformed Egyptian tongue, and Smith
translated them through the inspiration of the angel, and one Oliver
Cowdrey wrote down the translation as reported by the God-possessed
Joseph. This translation was published in 1830, and its divine origin
was attested by a dozen persons&mdash;all relatives and friends of Smith.
Only these have ever pretended to see the original plates, which have
already become traditional. The plates have been frequently called for
by skeptics, but all in vain. Naturally, warm controversy arose
concerning the authenticity of the Book of Mormon, and disbelievers have
asserted that they have indubitable evidence that it is, with the
exception of various unlettered interpolations, principally borrowed
from a queer, rhapsodical romance written by an eccentric ex-clergyman
named Solomon Spalding.</p>

<p>Smith and his disciples were ridiculed and socially persecuted; but they
seemed to be ardently earnest, and continued to preach their creed,
which was to the effect that the millennium was at hand; that our
aboriginals were to be converted, and that the New Jerusalem&mdash;the last
residence and home of the saints&mdash;was to be near the centre of this
continent. The Vermont prophet, later on, was repeatedly mobbed, even
shot at. His narrow escapes were construed as interpositions of divine
providence, but he displayed perfect coolness and intrepidity through
all his trials. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was
first established in the spring of 1830 at Manchester, N. Y.; but it
awoke such fierce opposition, particularly from the orthodox, many of
them preachers, that Smith and his associates deemed it prudent to move
farther west. They established themselves at Kirtland, O., and won there
many converts. Hostility to them still continued, and grew so fierce
that the body transferred itself to Missouri, and next to Illinois,
settling in the latter state near the village of Commerce, which was
renamed Nauvoo.</p>

<p>The Governor and Legislature of Illinois favored the Mormons, but the
anti-Mormons made war on them in every way, and the custom of "sealing
wives," which is yet mysterious to the Gentiles, caused serious
outbreaks, and resulted in the incarceration of the prophet and his
brother Hiram at Carthage. Fearing that the two might be released by the
authorities, a band of ruffians broke into the jail, in the summer of
1844, and murdered them in cold blood. This was most fortunate for the
memory of Smith and for his doctrines. It placed him in the light of a
holy martyr, and lent to them a dignity and vitality they had never
before enjoyed.</p></div>

adopting <i>Pagan religious symbols</i>, and baptizing them anew, the

unless anointed. (See The Martyrdom of Jesus of Nazareth, p. 42.)</p></div>

one will doubt; and since they could neither wish or expect the Roman
Governor to make himself judge of <i>their sacred law</i>, it becomes certain
that their accusation was <i>purely political</i>, and took such a form as
this: 'He has accepted tumultuous shouts that he is the legitimate and
predicted <i>King of Israel</i>, and in this character has ridden into
Jerusalem with the forms of state understood to be <i>royal</i> and <i>sacred</i>;
with what purpose, we ask, if not to overturn <i>our</i> institutions, and
<i>your</i> dominion?' If Jesus spoke, at the crisis which Matthew
represents, the virulent speech attributed to him (Matt. xxiii.), we may
well believe that this gave a new incentive to the rulers; for it is
such as no government in Europe would overlook or forgive: <i>but they are
not likely to have expected Pilate to care for any conduct which might
be called an ecclesiastical broil</i>. The assumption of <i>royalty</i> was
clearly the point of their attack. Even the mildest man among them may
have thought his conduct dangerous and needing repression." (Francis W.
Newman, "What is Christianity without Christ?")</p>

<p><i>According to the Synoptic Gospels</i>, Jesus was completely innocent of
the charge which has sometimes been brought against him, <i>that he wished
to be considered as a God come down to earth</i>. His enemies certainly
would not have failed to make such a pretension the basis and the
continual theme of their accusations, if it had been possible to do so.
<i>The two grounds upon which he was brought before the Sanhedrim were,
first, the bold words he was supposed to have spoken about the temple;

orthodox among the Christians. The Rev. George Matheson, D. D., Minister
of the Parish of Innellan, and a member of the Scotch Kirk, speaking of
the precept uttered by Confucius, five hundred years before the time
assigned for the birth of Jesus of Nazareth ("Whatsoever ye would not
that others should do unto you, do not ye unto them"), says: "That
Confucius is the <i>author</i> of this precept is undisputed, <i>and therefore
it is indisputable that Christianity has incorporated an article of
Chinese morality</i>. It has appeared to some as if this were to the
disparagement of Christianity&mdash;as if the originality of its Divine
Founder were impaired by consenting to borrow a precept from a heathen
source. <i>But in what sense <ins class="corr" title="original has dose">does</ins> Christianity set up the claim of moral
originality?</i> When we speak of the religion of Christ as having
introduced into the world a purer life and a surer guide to conduct,
what do we mean? Do we mean to suggest that Christianity has, <i>for the
first time</i>, revealed to the world the existence of a set of
self-sacrificing precepts&mdash;that here, <i>for the first time</i>, man has
learned that he ought to be meek, merciful, humble, forgiving, sorrowful
for sin, peaceable, and pure in heart? The proof of such a statement
would destroy Christianity itself, for an <i>absolute original code of
precepts</i> would be equivalent to a foreign language. <i>The glory of
Christian morality is that it is</i> <span class="allcapsc">NOT ORIGINAL</span>&mdash;that its words appeal to
something which <i>already exists within the human heart</i>, and on that
account have a meaning to the human ear: <i>no new revelation can be made
except through the medium of an old one</i>. When we attribute originality
to the ethics of the Gospel, we do so on the ground, <i>not that it has
given new precepts</i>, but that it has given us a new impulse to obey the
moral instincts of the soul. Christianity itself claims on the field of
morals this originality, <i>and this alone</i>&mdash;'A new commandment give I
unto you, that you love one another." (St. Giles Lectures, Second
Series: The Faiths of the World. Religion of China, by the Rev. George
Matheson, D. D., Minister of the Parish of Innellan. Wm. Blackwood &amp;

World, the Tortoise-myth belongs especially to <i>India</i>, and the idea is
developed there in a variety of forms. The tortoise that holds the world
is called in Sanscrit Kura-mraja, "King of the Tortoises," and many
Hindoos believe to this day that the world rests on its back. "The
striking analogy between the Tortoise-myth of North America and India,"
says Mr. Tyler, "is by no means a matter of new observation; it was
indeed remarked upon by Father Lafitau nearly a century and a half ago.
Three great features of the Asiatic stories are found among the North
American Indians, in the fullest and clearest development. The earth is

<p>The myth of foot-prints stamped into the rocks by gods or mighty men, is

of India; the God of Wisdom. Humboldt, who copied a Mexican painting of
a man with an elephant's head, remarks that "it presents some remarkable
and apparently <i>not accidental</i> resemblances with the Hindoo Ganesa."</p>

<p>The horse and the ass, although natives of America,<a name="FNanchor_537:7_2668" id="FNanchor_537:7_2668"></a><a href="#Footnote_537:7_2668" class="fnanchor">[537:7]</a> became
extinct on the Western Continent in an early period of the earth's

representations of both these animals, which show that it must have been

saw the horses which the Spaniards brought over, they were greatly
astonished, and when they saw the Spaniards on horseback, they imagined
man and horse to be <i>one</i>.</p>

<p>Certain of the temples of <i>India</i> abound with sculptural representations

<p>E. Spence Hardy, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The ancient edifices of Chi Chen, in Central America, bear a

summit, the trees growing on the sides, the appearance of

small doorway at the base, are so exactly similar to what I
had seen at Anur&aacute;dhapura, <i>that when my eye first fell upon

<p>E. G. Squire, speaking of this, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Bud'hist temples of Southern India, and of the islands of
the Indian Archipelago, as described to us by the learned
members of the Asiatic Society, and the numerous writers on

minor features, with those of <i>Central America</i>."<a name="FNanchor_538:4_2673" id="FNanchor_538:4_2673"></a><a href="#Footnote_538:4_2673" class="fnanchor">[538:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Structures of a <i>pyramidal</i> style, which are common in India, were also

<p>Sir R. Kir Porter writes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"What striking analogies exist between the monuments of the
old continents and those of the Toltecs, who, arriving on
Mexican soil, built several of these colossal structures,
truncated pyramids, divided by layers, like the temple of
Belus at Babylon. <i>Whence did they take the model of these
edifices? Were they of the Mongolian race? Did they descend
from a common stock with the Chinese, the Hiong-nu, and the
Japanese?</i><ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_538:6_2675" id="FNanchor_538:6_2675"></a><a href="#Footnote_538:6_2675" class="fnanchor">[538:6]</a></p></div>

<p>The similarity in <i>features</i> of the Asiatic and the American race is
very striking. Alexander de Humboldt, speaking of this, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There are striking contrasts between the Mongol and American
races."<a name="FNanchor_538:7_2676" id="FNanchor_538:7_2676"></a><a href="#Footnote_538:7_2676" class="fnanchor">[538:7]</a> "Over a million and a half of square leagues,
from the Terra del Fuego islands to the River St. Lawrence and
Behring's Straits, we are struck at the first glance with the
general resemblance in the features of the inhabitants. <i>We
think we perceive that they all descended from the same
stock</i>, notwithstanding the enormous diversity of language
which separates them from one another."<a name="FNanchor_538:8_2677" id="FNanchor_538:8_2677"></a><a href="#Footnote_538:8_2677" class="fnanchor">[538:8]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>"This analogy is particularly evident in the color of the

<p>Dr. Morton says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In reflecting on the aboriginal races of America, we are at
once met by the striking fact, that their physical characters
are wholly independent of all climatic or known physical
influences. Notwithstanding their immense geographical
distribution, embracing every variety of climate, it is
acknowledged by all travellers, that there is among this
people a prevailing type, around which all the tribes&mdash;north,
south, east and west&mdash;cluster, though varying within
prescribed limits. With trifling exceptions, all our American
Indians bear to each other some degree of family resemblance,
quite as strong, for example, as that seen at the present day
among full-blooded Jews."<a name="FNanchor_539:2_2679" id="FNanchor_539:2_2679"></a><a href="#Footnote_539:2_2679" class="fnanchor">[539:2]</a></p></div>

<p>James Orton, the traveler, was also struck with the likeness of the
American Indians to the Chinese, including the flatted nose. Speaking of
the Zaparos of the Napo River, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Zaparos in physiognomy somewhat resemble the Chinese,
having a middle stature, round face, small eyes set angularly,
and a broad, flat nose."<a name="FNanchor_539:3_2680" id="FNanchor_539:3_2680"></a><a href="#Footnote_539:3_2680" class="fnanchor">[539:3]</a></p></div>

<p>Oscar Paschel says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The obliquely-set eyes and prominent cheek-bones of the
inhabitants of Veragua were noticed by Monitz Wagner, and
according to his description, out of four Bayano Indians from
Darien, three had thoroughly Mongolian features, including the
flatted nose."</p></div>

<p>In 1866, an officer of the Sharpshooter, the first English man-of-war
which entered the Paran&aacute; River in Brazil, remarks in almost the same
words of the Indians of that district, that their features vividly
reminded him of the Chinese. Burton describes the Brazilian natives at
the falls of Cachauhy as having thick, round Kalmuck heads, flat Mongol
faces, wide, very prominent cheek bones, oblique and sometimes
narrow-slit Chinese eyes, and slight mustaches.</p>

<p>Another traveler, J. J. Von Tschudi, declares in so many words that he
has seen Chinese whom at the first glance he mistook for Botocudos, and
that since then he has been convinced that the American race ought not
to be separated from the Mongolian. His predecessor, St. Hilaire,
noticed narrow, obliquely-set eyes and broad noses among the Malali of
Brazil. Reinhold Hensel says of the Coroados, that their features are of
Mongoloid type, due especially to the prominence of the cheek-bones, but
that the oblique position of the eyes is not perceptible. Yet the
oblique opening of the eye, which forms a good though not an essential
characteristic of the Mongolian nations, is said to be characteristic of
all the Guarani tribes in Brazil. Even in the extreme south, among the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>Hiullitches of Patagonia, King saw a great many with obliquely set
eyes. Those writers who separate the Americans as a peculiar race fail
to give distinctive characters, common to them all, which distinguish
them from the Asiatic Mongols. All the tribes have stiff, long hair,
cylindrical in section. The beard and hair of the body is always scanty
or totally absent. The color of the skin varies considerably, as might
be expected in a district of 110&deg; of latitude; it ranges from a light
South European darkness of complexion among the Botocudos, of the
deepest dye among the Aymara, or to copper red in the Sonor tribes. But
no one has tried to draw limits between races on account of these shades
of color, especially as they are of every conceivable gradation.<a name="FNanchor_540:1_2681" id="FNanchor_540:1_2681"></a><a href="#Footnote_540:1_2681" class="fnanchor">[540:1]</a></p>

<p>Charles G. Leland says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins>The Tunguse, Mongolians, and a great part of the Turkish race
formed originally, according to all external organic tokens,
as well as the elements of their language, but one people,

the Norseman, and the races of the New World. This is the
irrefutable result to which all the more recent inquiries in
anatomy and physiology, as well as comparative philology and
history, have conduced. All the aboriginal Americans have
those distinctive tokens which forcibly recall their neighbors
dwelling on the other side of Behring's Straits. They have the
four-cornered head, high cheek-bones, heavy jaws, large
angular eye-cavities, and a retreating forehead. The skulls of
the oldest Peruvian graves exhibit the same tokens as the

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A Mongolian came riding up on a little black pony, followed
by a servant on a camel, rocking like a windmill. He stopped a
moment to exchange pantomimic salutations. He was full of
electricity, and alive with motion; the blood was warm in his
veins, and the fire was bright in his eye. I could have sworn
that he was an <i>Apache;</i> every action, motion and look
reminded me of my old enemies and neighbors in <i>Arizona</i>. They
are the true descendants of the nomadic Tartars of Asia and
preserve every instinct of the race. He shook hands friendlily

<p>During the <i>Champlain</i> period in the earth's history the climate of the
northern portion of the American continent, instead of being frigid, and
the country covered with sheets of ice, was more like the climate of the
Middle States of the present day. Tropical animals went North, and
during the Terrace period&mdash;which followed the Champlain&mdash;the climate
changed to frigid, and many of these tropical animals were frozen in the
ice, and some of their remains were discovered centuries after.</p>

<p>It was probably during the time when the climate in those northern
regions was warm, that the aborigines crossed over, and even if they did
not do so at that time, we must not be startled at the idea that Asiatic
tribes crossed over from Asia to America, when the country was covered
with ice. There have been nations who lived in a state of nudity among
ice-fields, and, even at the present day, a naked nation of fishermen
still exist in Terra del Fuego, where the glaciers stretch down to the
sea, and even into it.<a name="FNanchor_541:3_2688" id="FNanchor_541:3_2688"></a><a href="#Footnote_541:3_2688" class="fnanchor">[541:3]</a></p>

<p>Chas. Darwin, during his voyage round the world in H. M. S. Beagle, was
particularly struck with the hardiness of the Fuegians, who go in a
state of nudity, or almost entirely so. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Among these central tribes the men generally have an
otter-skin, or some small scrap, about as large as a
pocket-handkerchief, to cover their nakedness, which is barely
sufficient to cover their backs as low down as their
loins."<a name="FNanchor_541:4_2689" id="FNanchor_541:4_2689"></a><a href="#Footnote_541:4_2689" class="fnanchor">[541:4]</a></p></div>

<p>One day while going on shore near Wollaston Island, Mr. Darwin's party
pulled alongside a canoe which contained six Fuegians, who were, he
says, "quite naked, and even one full-grown woman was absolutely so. It
was raining heavily, and the fresh water, together with the spray,
trickled down her body. In another harbor not far distant, a woman, who
was suckling a recently-born child, came one <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>day alongside the vessel,
and remained there out of mere curiosity, whilst the sleet fell and
thawed on her naked bosom, and on the skin of her naked baby!"<a name="FNanchor_542:1_2690" id="FNanchor_542:1_2690"></a><a href="#Footnote_542:1_2690" class="fnanchor">[542:1]</a></p>

<p>This was during the winter season.</p>

<p>A few pages farther on Mr. Darwin says that on the night of the 22d
December, a small family of Fuegians&mdash;who were living in a cove near the
quarters&mdash;"soon joined our party round a blazing fire. We were well
clothed, and though sitting close to the fire were far from too warm;
yet these naked savages, though further off, were observed, to our great
surprise, to be streaming with perspiration at undergoing such a
scorching. They seemed, however, very well pleased, and all joined in
the chorus of the seamen's songs; but the manner in which they were
invariably a little behind was quite ludicrous."<a name="FNanchor_542:2_2691" id="FNanchor_542:2_2691"></a><a href="#Footnote_542:2_2691" class="fnanchor">[542:2]</a></p>

<p>The Asiatics who first crossed over to the American continent were
evidently in a very barbarous stage, although they may have known how to
produce fire, and use bows and arrows.<a name="FNanchor_542:3_2692" id="FNanchor_542:3_2692"></a><a href="#Footnote_542:3_2692" class="fnanchor">[542:3]</a> The tribe who inhabited
Mexico at the time it was discovered by the Spaniards was not the first
to settle there; they had driven out a people, and had taken the country
from them.<a name="FNanchor_542:4_2693" id="FNanchor_542:4_2693"></a><a href="#Footnote_542:4_2693" class="fnanchor">[542:4]</a></p>

<p>That Mexico was visited by Orientals, who brought and planted their
religion there, in a comparatively recent period, is very probable. Mr.
Chas. G. Leland, who has made this subject a special study, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"While the proofs of the existence or residence of Orientals
in America are extremely vague and uncertain, and while they
are supported only by coincidences, the antecedent probability
of their having come hither, or having been able to come, is
stronger than the Norse discovery of the New World, or even
than that of Columbus himself would appear to be. Let the
reader take a map of the Northern Pacific; let him ascertain
for himself the fact that from Kamtschatka, which was well
known to the old Chinese, to Alaska the journey is far less
arduous than from China proper, and it will be seen that there
was in all probability intercourse of some kind between the
continents. In early times the Chinese were bold and skillful
navigators, to whom the chain of the Aleutian Islands would
have been simply like stepping-stones over a shallow brook to
a child. For it is a well ascertained fact, that a sailor in
an open boat might cross from Asia to America by the Aleutian
Islands in summer-time, and hardly ever <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>be out of sight of
land, and this in a part of the sea generally abounding in
fish, as is proved by the fishermen who inhabit many of these
islands, on which fresh water is always to be found."<a name="FNanchor_543:1_2694" id="FNanchor_543:1_2694"></a><a href="#Footnote_543:1_2694" class="fnanchor">[543:1]</a></p></div>

<p>Colonel Barclay Kennon, formerly of the U. S. North Pacific surveying
expedition, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"From the result of the most accurate scientific observation,
it is evident that the voyage from China to America can be
made without being out of sight of land more than a few hours
at any one time. To a landsman, unfamiliar with long voyages,
the mere idea of being 'alone on the wide, wide sea,' with
nothing but water visible, even for an hour, conveys a strange
sense of desolation, of daring, and of adventure. But in truth
it is regarded as a mere trifle, not only by regular seafaring
men, but even by the rudest races in all parts of the world;
and I have no doubt that from the remotest ages, and on all
shores, fishermen in open boats, canoes, or even coracles,
guided simply by the stars and currents, have not hesitated to
go far out of sight of land. At the present day, natives of
many of the South Pacific Islands undertake, without a
compass, and successfully, long voyages which astonish even a
regular Jack-tar, who is not often astonished at anything. If
this can be done by savages, it hardly seems possible that the
Asiatic-American voyage was not successfully performed by
people of advanced scientific culture, who had, it is
generally believed, the compass, and who from an early age
were proficient in astronomy."<a name="FNanchor_543:2_2695" id="FNanchor_543:2_2695"></a><a href="#Footnote_543:2_2695" class="fnanchor">[543:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Prof. Max M&uuml;ller, it would seem, entertains similar ideas to our own,
expressed as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In their (the American Indians') languages, as well as in
their religions, traces may possibly still be found, before it
is too late, <i>of pre-historic migrations of men from the
primitive Asiatic to the American Continent, either across the
stepping-stones of the Aleutic bridge in the North, or lower
South, by drifting with favorable winds from island to island,
till the hardy canoe was landed or wrecked on the American
coast, never to return again to the Asiatic home from which it
had started</i>."<a name="FNanchor_543:3_2696" id="FNanchor_543:3_2696"></a><a href="#Footnote_543:3_2696" class="fnanchor">[543:3]</a></p></div>

<p>It is very evident then, that the religion and mythology of the Old and
New Worlds, have, in part, at least, a common origin. Lord Kingsborough
informs us that the Spanish historians of the 16th century were not
disposed to admit that America had ever been colonized from the West,
"chiefly on account of the state in which religion was found in the new
continent."<a name="FNanchor_543:4_2697" id="FNanchor_543:4_2697"></a><a href="#Footnote_543:4_2697" class="fnanchor">[543:4]</a></p>

<p>And Mr. Tylor says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Among the mass of Central American traditions .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there occur
certain passages in the story of an early emigration of the
Quich&eacute; race, which have much the appearance of vague and
broken stories derived in some way from high Northern
latitudes."<a name="FNanchor_543:5_2698" id="FNanchor_543:5_2698"></a><a href="#Footnote_543:5_2698" class="fnanchor">[543:5]</a></p></div>

<p>Mr. McCulloh, in his "Researches," observes that:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"In analyzing many parts of their (the ancient Americans')
institutions, especially those belonging to their cosmogonal
history, their religious superstitions, and astronomical
computations, we have, in these abstract matters, found
abundant proof to assert that there has been formerly a
connection between the people of the two continents. Their
communications, however, have taken place at a very remote
period of time; for those matters in which they more decidedly
coincide, are undoubtedly those which belong to the earliest
history of mankind."</p></div>

<p>It is unquestionably from <i>India</i> that we have derived, partly through
the Persians and other nations, most of our metaphysical and theological
doctrines, as well as our nursery tales. Who then can deny that these
same doctrines and legends have been handed down by oral tradition to
the chief of the Indian tribes, and in this way have been preserved,
although perhaps in an obscure and imperfect manner, in some instances
at least, until the present day? The facts which we have before us, with
many others like them which are to be had, point with the greatest
likelihood to a common fatherland, the cradle of all nations, from which
they came, taking these traditions with them.</p>

<p>Mr. Prescott, speaking of the Pyramid of Cholula, in his Mexican
History, says: "On the summit stood a sumptuous temple, in which was the
image of the mystic deity (<i>Quetzalcoatle</i>), with <i>ebon</i> features,
unlike the fair complexion which he bore upon earth." And Kenneth R. H.
Mackenzie says (in Cities of the Ancient World, p. 180): "From the
woolly texture of the hair, I am inclined to assign to the Buddha of
India, the Fuhi of China, the Sommonacom of the Siamese, the Xaha of the
Japanese, and the Quetzalcoatle of the Mexicans, the same, and indeed an
African, or rather Nubian, origin."</p></div>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_B" id="APPENDIX_B"></a>APPENDIX B.</h2>

<p>Commencing at the farthest East we shall find the ancient religion of
<i>China</i> the same as that which was universal in all quarters of the
globe, viz., an adoration of the Sun, Moon, Stars and elements.<a name="FNanchor_544:1_2699" id="FNanchor_544:1_2699"></a><a href="#Footnote_544:1_2699" class="fnanchor">[544:1]</a>
That the Chinese religion was in one respect the same as that of India,
is seen from the fact that they named successive days for the same seven
planets that the Hindoos did.<a name="FNanchor_544:2_2700" id="FNanchor_544:2_2700"></a><a href="#Footnote_544:2_2700" class="fnanchor">[544:2]</a> The ancient books of the Chinese
show that astronomy was not only understood by them at a very early
period, but that it formed an important branch of state policy, and the
basis of public ceremonies. Eclipses are accurately recorded which
occurred twenty centuries before Jesus; and the Confucian books refer
continually to observations of the heavenly bodies and the rectification
of the calendar. The ancient Chinese astronomers seem to have known
precisely the excess of the solar year beyond 365 days. The <i>religion</i>
of China, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>under the emperors who preceded the first dynasty, is an
enigma. The notices in the only authentic works, the <i>King</i>, are on this
point scanty, vague, and obscure. It is difficult to separate what is
spoken with reference to the science of <i>astronomy</i> from that which may
relate to <i>religion</i>, properly so called. The terms of reverence and
respect, with which the <i>heavenly bodies</i> are spoken of in the
<i>Shoo-King</i>, seem to warrant the inference that those terms have more
than a mere astronomical meaning, <i>and that the ancient religion</i> of
<i>China partook</i> of <i>star-worship, one of the oldest heresies in the
world</i>.<a name="FNanchor_545:1_2701" id="FNanchor_545:1_2701"></a><a href="#Footnote_545:1_2701" class="fnanchor">[545:1]</a></p>

<p>In <i>India</i> the Sun, Moon, Stars and the powers of Nature were worshiped
and personified, and each quality, mental and physical, had its emblem,
which the Brahmans taught the ignorant to regard as realities, till the
Pantheon became crowded.</p>

<p>"Our Aryan ancestors learned to look up to the sky, the Sun, and the
dawn, and there to see the presence of a living power, half-revealed,
and half-hidden from their senses, those senses which were always
postulating something beyond what they could grasp. They went further
still. In the bright sky they perceived an <i>Illuminator</i>, in the
all-encircling firmament an <i>Embracer</i>, in the roar of the thunder or in
the voice of the storm they felt the presence of a <i>Shouter</i> and of
furious <i>Strikers</i>, and out of the rain they created an <i>Indra</i>, or
giver of rain."<a name="FNanchor_545:2_2702" id="FNanchor_545:2_2702"></a><a href="#Footnote_545:2_2702" class="fnanchor">[545:2]</a></p>

<p>Prof. Monier Williams, speaking of "the hymns of the <i>Veda</i>," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To what deities, it will be asked, were the prayers and hymns
of these collections addressed? The answer is: They worshiped
<i>those physical forces</i> before which <i>all nations</i>, if guided
solely by the light of nature, have in the early period of
their life, instinctively bowed down, and before which even
the most civilized and enlightened have always been compelled
to bend in awe and reverence, if not in adoration."<a name="FNanchor_545:3_2703" id="FNanchor_545:3_2703"></a><a href="#Footnote_545:3_2703" class="fnanchor">[545:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The following sublime description of <i>Night</i> is an extract from the
<i>Vedas</i>, made by Sir William Jones:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Night approaches, illumined with stars and planets, and,
looking on all sides with numberless eyes, overpowers all
meaner lights. The immortal goddess pervades the firmament,
covering the low valleys and shrubs, the lofty mountains and
trees, but soon she disturbs the gloom with celestial
effulgence. Advancing with brightness, at length she recalls
her sister <i>Morning</i>; and the nightly shade gradually melts
away. May she at this time be propitious! She, in whose early
watch we may calmly recline in our mansions, as birds repose
upon the trees. Mankind now sleep in their towns; now herds
and flocks peacefully slumber, and the winged creatures, swift
falcons, and vultures. O Night! <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>avert from us the she-wolf
and the wolf; and, oh! suffer us to pass thee in soothing
rest! Oh, morn! remove in due time this black, yet visible
overwhelming darkness, which at present enfolds me, as thou
enablest me to remove the cloud of their dells. <i>Daughter of
Heaven</i>, I approach thee with praise, as the cow approaches
her milker; accept, O Night! not the hymn only, but the
oblation of thy suppliant, who prays that his foes may be
subdued."</p></div>

<p>Some of the principal gods of the Hindoo Pantheon are, Dyaus (the Sky),
Indra (the Rain-giver), S&ucirc;rya (the Sun), the Maruts (Winds), Aditi, (the
Dawn), Parvati (the Earth),<a name="FNanchor_546:1_2704" id="FNanchor_546:1_2704"></a><a href="#Footnote_546:1_2704" class="fnanchor">[546:1]</a> and Siva, her consort. The worship of
the <span class="smcap">Sun</span> is expressed in a variety of ways, and by a multitude of
fanciful names. One of the principal of these is <i>Crishna</i>. The
following is a prayer addressed to him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Be auspicious to my lay, O Chrishna, thou only God of the
seven heavens, who swayest the universe through the immensity
of space and matter. O universal and resplendent Sun! Thou
mighty governor of the heavens; thou sovereign regulator of
the connected whole; thou sole and universal deity of mankind;
thou gracious and Supreme Spirit; my noblest and most happy
inspiration is thy praise and glory. Thy power I will praise,
for thou art my sovereign Lord, whose bright image continually
forces itself on my attention, eager imagination. Thou art the
Being to whom heroes pray in perils of war; nor are their
supplications vain, when thus they pray; whether it be when
thou illuminest the eastern region with thy orient light, when
in thy meridian splendor, or when thou majestically descendest
in the West."</p></div>

<p>Crishna is made to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am the light in the Sun and Moon, far, far beyond the
darkness. I am the brilliancy in flame, the radiance in all
that's radiant, and the light of lights."<a name="FNanchor_546:2_2705" id="FNanchor_546:2_2705"></a><a href="#Footnote_546:2_2705" class="fnanchor">[546:2]</a></p></div>

<p>In the <i>Maha-bharata</i>, Crishna, who having become the son of Aditi (the
Dawn), is called <i>Vishnu</i>, another name for the Sun.<a name="FNanchor_546:3_2706" id="FNanchor_546:3_2706"></a><a href="#Footnote_546:3_2706" class="fnanchor">[546:3]</a> The demon
<i>Putana</i> assaults the child Crishna, which identifies him with Hercules,
the Sun-god of the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_546:4_2707" id="FNanchor_546:4_2707"></a><a href="#Footnote_546:4_2707" class="fnanchor">[546:4]</a> In his Solar character he must again
be the slayer of the Dragon or Black-snake <i>Kulnika</i>, the "Old Serpent"
with the thousand heads.<a name="FNanchor_546:5_2708" id="FNanchor_546:5_2708"></a><a href="#Footnote_546:5_2708" class="fnanchor">[546:5]</a> Crishna's amours with the maidens makes
him like Indra, Phoibus, Hercules, Samson, Alpheios, Paris and other
Sun-gods. This is the hot and fiery Sun greeting the moon and the dew,
or the Sun with his brides the <i>Stars</i>.<a name="FNanchor_546:6_2709" id="FNanchor_546:6_2709"></a><a href="#Footnote_546:6_2709" class="fnanchor">[546:6]</a></p>

<p>Moore, in his Hindu Pantheon, observes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Although all the Hindu deities partake more or less remotely
of the nature and character of Surya, or the <span class="smcap">Sun</span>, and all more
or less directly radiate from, or merge in, him, yet no one
is, I think, so intimately identified with him as Vishnu;
whether considered in his own person, or <i>in the character of
his most glorious Avatara of</i> <span class="smcap">Crishna</span>."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span></p><p>The ancient religion of <span class="smcap">Egypt</span>, like that of Hindostan, was founded on
astronomy, and eminently metaphysical in its character. The Egyptian
priests were far advanced in the science of astronomy. They made
astronomy their peculiar study. They knew the figure of the earth, and
how to calculate solar and lunar eclipses. From very ancient time, they
had observed the order and movement of the stars, and recorded them with
the utmost care. Ramses the Great, generally called Sesostris, is
supposed to have reigned one thousand five hundred years before the
Christian era, about coeval with Moses, or a century later. In the tomb
of this monarch was found a large massive circle of wrought gold,
divided into three hundred and sixty-five degrees, and each division
marked the rising and setting of the stars for each day.<a name="FNanchor_547:1_2710" id="FNanchor_547:1_2710"></a><a href="#Footnote_547:1_2710" class="fnanchor">[547:1]</a> This
fact proves how early they were advanced in astronomy. In their great
theories of mutual dependence between all things in the universe was
included a belief in some mysterious relation between the Spirits of the
Stars and human souls, so that the destiny of mortals was regulated by
the motions of the heavenly bodies. This was the origin of the famous
system of Astrology. From the conjunction of planets at the hour of
birth, they prophesied what would be the temperament of an infant, what
life he would live, and what death he would die. Diodorus, who wrote in
the century preceding Christ Jesus, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They frequently foretell with the greatest accuracy what is
about to happen to mankind; showing the failure or abundance
of crops, and the epidemic diseases about to befall men or
cattle. Earthquakes, deluges, rising of comets, and all those
phenomena, the knowledge of which appears impossible to common
comprehensions, they foresee by means of their long continued
observation."</p></div>

<p>P. Le Page Renouf, who is probably the best authority on the religion of
ancient Egypt which can be produced, says, in his Hibbert
Lectures:<a name="FNanchor_547:2_2711" id="FNanchor_547:2_2711"></a><a href="#Footnote_547:2_2711" class="fnanchor">[547:2]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Lectures on the Science of Language, delivered nearly
twenty years ago by Prof. Max M&uuml;ller, have, I trust, made us
fully understand how, among the <i>Indo-European</i> races, the
names of the <i>Sun</i>, of <i>Sunrise</i> and <i>Sunset</i>, and of other
such phenomena, come to be talked of and considered as
<i>personages</i>, of whom wondrous legends have been told.
<i>Egyptian</i> mythology not merely admits, but imperatively
<i>demands, the same explanation</i>. And this becomes the more
evident when we consider the question how these mythical
personages came to be invested with the attributes of divinity
by men who, like the Egyptians, had so lively a sense of the
divine."</p></div>

<p>Kenrick, in his "History of Egypt," says:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"We have abundant evidence that the Egyptian theology had its
origin in the personification of the powers of nature, under
male and female attributes, and that this conception took a
sensible form, such as the mental state of the people
required, by the identification of these powers with the
elements and the heavenly bodies, fire, earth, water, the sun
and moon, and the Nile. Such appears <i>everywhere</i> to be the
origin of the objective form of polytheism; and it is equally
evident among the nations most closely allied to the Egyptians
by position and general character&mdash;the Phenicians, the
Babylonians, and in remote connection, the Indians on the one
side and the Greeks on the other."</p></div>

<p>The gods and goddesses of the ancient <span class="smcap">Persians</span> were also
personifications of the Sun, Moon, Stars, the elements, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Ormuzd</i>, "The King of Light," was god of the <i>Firmament</i>, and the
"Principle of Goodness" and of Truth. He was called "The Eternal Source
of Sunshine and Light," "The Centre of all that exists," "The First-born
of the Eternal One," "The Creator," "The Sovereign Intelligence," "The
All-seeing," "The Just Judge." He was described as "sitting on the
throne of the good and the perfect, in regions of pure light," crowned
with rays, and with a ring on his finger&mdash;a circle being an emblem of
infinity; sometimes as a venerable, majestic man, seated on a Bull,
their emblem of creation.</p>

<p>"<i>Mithras the Mediator</i>" was the god-Sun. Their most splendid
ceremonials were in honor of Mithras. They kept his birth-day, with many
rejoicings, on the twenty-fifth of December, when the Sun perceptibly
begins to return northward, after his long winter journey; and they had
another festival in his honor, at the vernal equinox. Perhaps no
religious festival was ever more splendid than the "<i>Annual Salutation
of Mithras</i>," during which <i>forty days</i> were set apart for thanksgiving
and sacrifice. The procession to salute the god was formed long before
the rising of the Sun. The High Priest was followed by a long train of
the Magi, in spotless white robes, chanting hymns, and carrying the
sacred fire on silver censers. Then came three hundred and sixty-five
youths in scarlet, to represent the days of the year and the color of
fire. These were followed by the Chariot of the Sun, empty, decorated
with garlands, and drawn by superb <i>white horses</i> harnessed with pure
gold. Then came a white horse of magnificent size, his forehead blazing
with gems, in honor of Mithras. Close behind him rode the king, in a
chariot of ivory inlaid with gold, followed by his royal kindred in
embroidered garments, and a long train of nobles riding on camels richly
caparisoned. This gorgeous retinue, facing the East, slowly ascended
Mount Orontes. Arrived at the summit, the High Priest assumed his tiara
wreathed with myrtle, and hailed the first rays of the rising Sun with
incense and prayer. The other Magi gradually joined him in singing hymns
to Ormuzd, the source of all blessing, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>by whom the radiant Mithras had
been sent to gladden the earth and preserve the principle of life.
Finally, they all joined in one universal chorus of praise, while king,
princes and nobles, prostrated themselves before the orb of day.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Hebrews</span> worshiped the Sun, Moon, Stars, and "all the host of
heaven."<a name="FNanchor_549:1_2712" id="FNanchor_549:1_2712"></a><a href="#Footnote_549:1_2712" class="fnanchor">[549:1]</a> <i>El-Shaddai</i> was one of the names given to the god Sun.
Parkhurst, in his "Hebrew Lexicon," says, "<i>El</i> was the very name the
heathens gave to their god <i>Sol</i>, their Lord or Ruler of the hosts of
heaven." <i>El</i>, which means "the strong one in heaven"&mdash;the Sun, was
invoked by the ancestors of all the Semitic nations, before there were
Babylonians in Babylon, Phenicians in Sydon and Tyrus, before there were
Jews in Mesopotamia or Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_549:2_2713" id="FNanchor_549:2_2713"></a><a href="#Footnote_549:2_2713" class="fnanchor">[549:2]</a></p>

<p>The Sun was worshiped by the Hebrews under the names of Baal, Moloch,
Chemosh, &amp;c.; the Moon was Ashtoreth, the "Queen of Heaven."<a name="FNanchor_549:3_2714" id="FNanchor_549:3_2714"></a><a href="#Footnote_549:3_2714" class="fnanchor">[549:3]</a></p>

<p>The gods of the ancient <span class="smcap">Greeks</span> and <span class="smcap">Romans</span> were the same as the gods of
the Indian epic poems. We have, for example: Zeupiter (Jupiter),
corresponding to Dyaus-pitar (the Heaven-father), Juno, corresponding to
Parvati (the Mother Goddess), and Apollo, corresponding to Crishna (the
Sun, the Saviour).<a name="FNanchor_549:4_2715" id="FNanchor_549:4_2715"></a><a href="#Footnote_549:4_2715" class="fnanchor">[549:4]</a> Another name for the Sun among those people
was <i>Bacchus</i>. An Orphic verse, referring to the Sun, says, "he is
called Dionysos (a name of Bacchus) because he is carried with a
circular motion through the immensely extended heavens."<a name="FNanchor_549:5_2716" id="FNanchor_549:5_2716"></a><a href="#Footnote_549:5_2716" class="fnanchor">[549:5]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Prichard, in his "Analysis of Egyptian Mythology,"<a name="FNanchor_549:6_2717" id="FNanchor_549:6_2717"></a><a href="#Footnote_549:6_2717" class="fnanchor">[549:6]</a> speaking
of the ancient Greeks and Romans, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That the worship of the <i>powers of nature</i>, mitigated,
indeed, and embellished, constituted the foundation of the
Greek and Roman religion, will not be disputed by any person
who surveys the fables of the Olympian Gods with a more

<p>M. De Coulanges, speaking of them, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>Sun</i>, which gives fecundity; the <i>Earth</i>, which
nourishes; the <i>Clouds</i>, by turns beneficent and
destructive,&mdash;<i>such were the different powers of which they
could make gods</i>. But from each one of these elements
thousands of gods were created; because the same physical
agent, <i>viewed under different aspects</i>, received from men
different names. The Sun, for example, was called in one place
<i>Hercules</i> (the glorious); in another, <i>Ph&oelig;bus</i> (the
shining); and still again, <i>Apollo</i> (he who drives away night
or evil); one called him <i>Hyperion</i> (the elevated being);
another, <i>Alexicacos</i> (the beneficent); and in the course of
time groups of men, who had given these various names to the
brilliant luminary, <i>no longer saw that they had the same
god</i>."<a name="FNanchor_549:7_2718" id="FNanchor_549:7_2718"></a><a href="#Footnote_549:7_2718" class="fnanchor">[549:7]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span></p><p>Richard Payne Knight says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The primitive religion of the <i>Greeks</i>, like that of all
other nations not enlightened by <i>Revelation</i>, appears to have
been <i>elementary</i>, and to have consisted in an indistinct
worship of the <span class="smcap">Sun</span>, the <span class="smcap">Moon</span>, the <span class="smcap">Stars</span>, the <span class="smcap">Earth</span>, and the
<span class="smcap">Waters</span>, or rather, the spirits supposed to preside over these
bodies, and to direct their motions, and regulate their modes
of existence. Every river, spring or mountain had its local
genius, or peculiar deity; and as men naturally endeavored to
obtain the favor of their gods by such means as they feel best
adapted to win their own, the first worship consisted in
offering to them certain portions of whatever they held to be
most valuable. At the same time, the regular motions of the
heavenly bodies, the stated returns of summer and winter, of
day and night, with all the admirable order of the universe,
taught them to believe in the existence and agency of such
superior powers; the irregular and destructive efforts of
nature, such as lightnings and tempests, inundations and
earthquakes, persuaded them that these mighty beings had
passions and affections similar to their own, and only
differed in possessing greater strength, power, and
intelligence."<a name="FNanchor_550:1_2719" id="FNanchor_550:1_2719"></a><a href="#Footnote_550:1_2719" class="fnanchor">[550:1]</a></p></div>

<p>When the Grecian astronomers first declared that the Sun was not a
person, but a huge hot ball, instantly an outcry arose against them.
They were called "<i>blaspheming atheists</i>," and from that time to the
present, when any new discovery is made which seems to take away from
man his god, the cry of "<i>Atheist</i>" is instantly raised.</p>

<p>If we turn from the ancient Greeks and Romans, and take a look still
farther West and North, we shall find that the gods of all the <span class="smcap">Teutonic</span>
nations were the same as we have seen elsewhere. They had Odin or
Woden&mdash;from whom we have our <i>Wednesday</i>&mdash;the Al-fader (the Sky),
Frigga, the Mother Goddess (the Earth), "Baldur the Good," and
Thor&mdash;from whom we have our Thursday (personifications of the Sun),
besides innumerable other <i>genii</i>, among them Freyja&mdash;from whom we have
our Friday&mdash;and as she was the "Goddess of Love," we eat <i>fish</i> on that
day.<a name="FNanchor_550:2_2720" id="FNanchor_550:2_2720"></a><a href="#Footnote_550:2_2720" class="fnanchor">[550:2]</a></p>

<p>The gods of the ancient inhabitants of what are now called the "British
Islands" were identically the same. The <i>Sun</i>-god worshiped by the
Ancient Druids was called <i>Hu</i>, <i>Beli</i>, <i>Budd</i> and <i>Buddu-gre</i>.<a name="FNanchor_550:3_2721" id="FNanchor_550:3_2721"></a><a href="#Footnote_550:3_2721" class="fnanchor">[550:3]</a></p>

<p>The same worship which we have found in the Old World, from the farthest
East to the remotest West, may also be traced in <span class="smcap">America</span>, from its
simplest or least clearly defined form, among the roving hunters and
squalid Esquimaux of the North, through every intermediate stage of
development, to the imposing systems of Mexico and Peru, where it took a
form nearly corresponding that which it at one time sustained on the
banks of the Ganges, and on the plains of Assyria.<a name="FNanchor_550:4_2722" id="FNanchor_550:4_2722"></a><a href="#Footnote_550:4_2722" class="fnanchor">[550:4]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span></p><p>Father Acosta, speaking of the Mexicans, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Next to Viracocha, or their Supreme God, that which most
commonly they have, and do adore, is the <i>Sun</i>; and after,
those things which are most remarkable in the celestial or
elementary nature, as the Moon, Stars, Sea, and Land.</p>

<p>"Whoso shall merely look into it, shall find this manner which
the Devil hath used to deceive the Indians, to be the same
wherewith he hath deceived the Greeks and Romans, and other
ancient Gentiles, giving them to understand that these notable
creatures, the Sun, Moon, Stars, and elements, had power or
authority to do good or harm to men."<a name="FNanchor_551:1_2723" id="FNanchor_551:1_2723"></a><a href="#Footnote_551:1_2723" class="fnanchor">[551:1]</a></p></div>

<p>We see, then, that the gods and heroes of antiquity were originally
personifications of certain elements of Nature, and that the legends of
adventures ascribed to them are merely mythical forms of describing the
phenomena of these elements.</p>

<p>These legends relating to the elements of Nature, whether they had
reference to the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, or a certain natural
phenomenon, became, in the course of time, to be regarded as accounts of
men of a high order, who had once inhabited the earth. Sanctuaries and
temples were erected to these heroes, their bones were searched for, and
when found&mdash;which was always the case&mdash;were regarded as a great source
of strength to the town that possessed them; all relics of their stay on
earth were hallowed, and a form of worship was specially adapted to
them.</p>

<p>The idea that heavenly luminaries were inhabited by spirits, of a nature
intermediate between God and men, first led mortals to address prayers
to the orbs over which they were supposed to preside. In order to
supplicate these deities, when Sun, Moon, and Stars were not visible,
<i>they made images of them</i>, which the priests consecrated with many
ceremonies. Then they pronounced solemn invocations to draw down the
spirits into the statues provided for their reception. By this process
it was supposed that a mysterious connection was established between the
spirit and the image, so that prayers addressed to one were thenceforth
heard by the other. This was probably the origin of image worship
everywhere.</p>

<p>The <i>motive</i> of this worship was the same among all nations of
antiquity, <i>i. e.</i>, <i>fear</i>. They supposed that these deities were
irritated by the sins of men, but, at the same time, were merciful, and
capable of being appeased by prayer and repentance; for this reason men
offered to these deities sacrifices and prayers. How natural that such
should have been the case, for, as Abb&eacute; Dubois observes: "To the rude,
untutored eye, the 'Host of Heaven,' clothed in that calm beauty which
distinguishes an Oriental night, might well appear to be instinct with
some divine principle, endowed with consciousness, and the power to
influence, from its throne of unchanging splendor on high, the fortunes
of transitory mortals."</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_C" id="APPENDIX_C"></a>APPENDIX C.</h2>

<p>All the chief stories that we know so well are to be found in all times,
and in almost all countries. <i>Cinderella</i>, for one, is told in the
language of every country in Europe, and the same legend is found in the
fanciful tales related by the Greek poets; and still further back, it
appears in very ancient Hindoo legends. So, again, does <i>Beauty and the
Beast</i>; so does our familiar tale of <i>Jack, the Giant-Killer</i>; so also
do a great number of other fairy stories, each being told in different
countries and in different periods, with so much likeness as to show
that all the versions came from the same source, and yet with enough
difference to show that none of the versions are directly copied from
each other. "Indeed, when we compare the myths and legends of one
country with another, and of one period with another, we find out how
they have come to be so much alike, and yet in some things so different.
We see that there must have been <i>one origin</i> for all these stories,
that they must have been invented by <i>one people</i>, that this people must
have been afterwards divided, and that each part or division of it must
have brought into its new home the legends once common to them all, and
must have shaped and altered these according to the kind of place in
which they came to live; those of the North being sterner and more
terrible, those of the South softer and fuller of light and color, and
adorned with touches of more delicate fancy." And this, indeed, is
really the case. All the chief stories and legends are alike, because
they were first made by <i>one people</i>; and all the nations in which they
are now told in one form or another tell them because they are all
descended from this one common stock, the <i>Aryan</i>.</p>

<p>From researches made by Prof. Max M&uuml;ller, <ins class="corr" title="original has The">the</ins> Rev. George W. Cox, and
others, in England and Germany, in the science of <i>Comparative
Mythology</i>, we begin to see something of these ancient forefathers of
ours; to understand what kind of people they were, and to find that <i>our
fairy stories</i> are really made out of <i>their religion</i>.</p>

<p>The mind of the Aryan peoples in their ancient home was full of
imagination. They never ceased to wonder at what they saw and heard in
the sky and upon the earth. Their language was highly figurative, and so
the things which struck them with wonder, and which they could not
explain, were described under forms and names which were familiar to
them. "Thus, the thunder was to them the bellowing of a mighty beast, or
the rolling of a great chariot. In the lightning they saw a brilliant
serpent, or a spear shot across the sky, or a great fish darting swiftly
through the sea of cloud. The clouds were heavenly cows, who shed milk
upon the earth and refreshed it; or they were webs woven by heavenly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>women who drew water from the fountains on high and poured it down as
rain." Analogies which are but fancy to us, were realities to these men
of past ages. They could see in the waterspout a huge serpent who
elevated himself out of the ocean and reached his head to the skies.
They could feel, in the pangs of hunger, a live creature gnawing within
their bodies, and they heard the voices of the hill-dwarfs answering in
the echo. The <i>Sun</i>, the first object which struck them with wonder,
was, to them, the child of Night; the Dawn came before he was born, and
died as he rose in the heavens. He strangled the serpents of the night;
he went forth like a bridegroom out of his chamber, and like a giant, to
run his course.<a name="FNanchor_553:1_2724" id="FNanchor_553:1_2724"></a><a href="#Footnote_553:1_2724" class="fnanchor">[553:1]</a> He had to do battle with clouds and

Sometimes his ray broke forth, only, after brief splendor, to sink
beneath a deeper darkness; sometimes he burst forth at the end of his
course, trampling on the clouds which had dimmed his brilliancy, and
bathing his pathway with blood.<a name="FNanchor_553:4_2727" id="FNanchor_553:4_2727"></a><a href="#Footnote_553:4_2727" class="fnanchor">[553:4]</a> Sometimes, beneath mountains of

all of which have borne their part in the formation of mythology, is
there one which could not be used naturally by ourselves to describe the
phenomena of the outward world, and there is scarcely one, perhaps,
which has not been used by our own poets. There is a beauty in them,
which can never grow old or lose its charm. Poets of all ages recur to
them instinctively in times of the deepest grief or the greatest joy;
but, in the words of Professor Max M&uuml;ller, "it is impossible to enter
fully into the thoughts and feelings which passed through the minds of
the early poets when they formed names for that far East from whence
even the early Dawn, the Sun, the Day, their own life seemed to spring.
A new life flashed up every morning before their eyes, and the fresh
breezes of the Dawn reached them like greetings wafted across the golden
threshold of the sky from the distant lands beyond the mountains, beyond
the clouds, beyond the dawn, beyond the immortal sea which brought us
hither! The Dawn seemed to them to open golden gates for the Sun to pass
in triumph; and while those gates were open, their eyes and their minds
strove, in their childish way, to pierce beyond the limits of this
finite world. That silent aspect wakened in the human mind the
conception of the Infinite, the Immortal, the Divine; and the names of
the Dawn became naturally the names of higher powers.<a name="FNanchor_554:9_2743" id="FNanchor_554:9_2743"></a><a href="#Footnote_554:9_2743" class="fnanchor">[554:9]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span></p><p>"This imagery of the Aryans was applied by them to all they saw in the
sky. Sometimes, as we have said, the clouds were cows; they were also
dragons, which sought to slay the Sun; or great ships floating across
the sky, and casting anchor upon earth; or rocks, or mountains, or deep
caverns, in which evil deities hid the golden light. Then, also, they
were shaped by fancy into animals of various kinds&mdash;the bear, the wolf,
the dog, the ox; and into giant birds, and into monsters which were both
bird and beast.</p>

<p>"The winds, again, in their fancy, were the companions or ministers of
India, the sky-god. The spirits of the winds gathered into their host
the souls of the dead&mdash;thus giving birth to the Scandinavian and
Teutonic legend of the Wild Horseman, who rides at midnight through the
stormy sky, with his long train of dead behind him, and his weird hounds
before.<a name="FNanchor_555:1_2744" id="FNanchor_555:1_2744"></a><a href="#Footnote_555:1_2744" class="fnanchor">[555:1]</a> The Ribhus, or Arbhus, again, were the sunbeams or the
lightning, who forged the armor of the gods, and made their
thunderbolts, and turned old people young, and restored out of the hides
alone the slaughtered cow on which the gods had feasted."<a name="FNanchor_555:2_2745" id="FNanchor_555:2_2745"></a><a href="#Footnote_555:2_2745" class="fnanchor">[555:2]</a></p>

<p>Aryan myths, then, were no more than poetic fancies about light and
darkness, cloud and rain, night and day, storm and wind; and when they
moved westward and southward, <i>the Aryan race brought these legends with
it</i>; and out of these were shaped by degrees innumerable gods and demons
of the Hindoos, the devs and jinns of the Persians; the great gods, the
minor deities, and nymphs, and fauns, and satyrs of Greek mythology and
poetry; the stormy divinities, the giants, and trolls of the cold and
rugged North; the dwarfs of the German forests; the elves who dance
merrily in the moonlight of an English summer; and the "good people" who
play mischievous tricks upon stray peasants among the Irish hills.
<i>Almost all, indeed, that we have of a legendary kind comes to us from
our Aryan forefathers</i>&mdash;sometimes scarcely changed, sometimes so altered
that we have to puzzle out the links between the old and the new; but
all these myths and traditions, and old-world stories, when we come to
know the meaning of them, take us back to the time when the Aryan race
dwelt together in the high lands of central Asia, and they all mean the
same things&mdash;that is, the relation between the Sun and the earth, the
succession of night and day, of winter and summer, of storm and calm, of
cloud and tempest, and golden sunshine, and bright blue sky. And this is
the source from which we get our fairy stories, and tales of gods and
heroes; for underneath all of them there are the same fanciful meanings,
only changed and altered in the way of putting them by the lapse of ages
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>of time, by the circumstances of different countries, and by the fancy
of those who kept the wonderful tales alive without knowing what they
meant.</p>

<p>Thousands of years ago, the Aryan people began their march out of their
old country in mid-Asia. From the remains of their language, and the
likeness of their legends to those among other nations, we know that
ages and ages ago their country grew too small for them, so they were
obliged to move away from it. Some of them turned southward into India
and Persia, and some of them went westward into Europe&mdash;the time,
perhaps, when the land of Europe stretched from the borders of Asia to
the islands of Great Britain, and when there was no sea between them and
the main land. How they made their long and toilsome march we know not.
But, as Kingsley writes of such a movement of an ancient tribe, so we
may fancy these old Aryans marching westward&mdash;"the tall, bare-limbed
men, with stone axes on their shoulders and horn bows at their backs,
with herds of gray cattle, guarded by huge lap-eared mastiffs, with
shaggy white horses, heavy-horned sheep, and silky goats, moving always
westward through the boundless steppes, whither or why we know not, but
that the Al-Father had sent them forth. And behind us (he makes them
say) the rosy snow-peaks died into ghastly gray, lower and lower, as
every evening came; and before us the plains spread infinite, with
gleaming salt-lakes, and ever fresh tribes of gaudy flowers. Behind us,
dark lines of living beings streamed down the mountain slopes; around
us, dark lines crawled along the plains&mdash;all westward, westward ever.
Who could stand against us? We met the wild asses on the steppe, and
tamed them, and made them our slaves. We slew the bison herds, and swam
broad rivers on their skins. The python snake lay across our path; the
wolves and wild dogs snarled at us out of their coverts; we slew them
and went on. Strange giant tribes met us, and eagle visaged hordes,
fierce and foolish; we smote them, hip and thigh, and went on, westward
ever."<a name="FNanchor_556:1_2746" id="FNanchor_556:1_2746"></a><a href="#Footnote_556:1_2746" class="fnanchor">[556:1]</a> And so they went on, straight toward the West, or, as they
turned North and South, and thus overspread new lands, <i>they brought
with them their old ways of thought and forms of belief</i>, and the
stories in which these had taken form; <i>and on these were built up the
gods and heroes</i>, and all wonder-working creatures and things, and the
poetical fables and fancies which have come down to us, and which still
linger in our customs and our fairy tales; bright and sunny and
many-colored in the warm regions of the South, sterner and wilder and
rougher in the North, more homelike in the middle and western countries;
but always alike in their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>main features, and always having the same
meaning when we come to dig it out, and these forms and their meaning
being the same in the lands of the West Aryans as in those still peopled
by the Aryans of the East.</p>

<p>The story of <i>Cinderella</i> is one of the many fairy tales which help us
to find out their meaning, and take us straight back to the far-off land
where fairy legends began, and to the people who made them. This
well-known fairy tale has been found among the myths of our Aryan
ancestors, and from this we know that it is the story of the <i>Sun</i> and
the <i>Dawn</i>. Cinderella, gray and dark and dull, is all neglected when
she is away from the Sun, obscured by the envious clouds, her sisters,
and by her step-mother, the Night. So she is Aurora, the Dawn, and the
Fairy Prince is the Morning Sun, ever pursuing her, to claim her for his
bride. This is the legend as it is found in the ancient Hindoo books;
and this explains at once the <i>source</i> and the <i>meaning</i> of the fairy
tale.<a name="FNanchor_557:1_2747" id="FNanchor_557:1_2747"></a><a href="#Footnote_557:1_2747" class="fnanchor">[557:1]</a></p>

<p>Another tale which helps us in our task is that of <i>Jack the
Giant-Killer</i>, who is really one of the very oldest and most widely
<ins class="corr" title="original has extraneous comma after known">known characters</ins> in wonder-land. Now, who is this wonderful little
fellow? He is none other than the hero who, in all countries and ages,
fights with monsters and overcomes them; like Indra, the ancient Hindoo
Sun-god, whose thunderbolts slew the demons of drought in the far East;
or Perseus, who, in Greek story, delivers the maiden from the
sea-monster; or Odysseus, who tricks the giant Polyphemus, and causes
him to throw himself into the sea; or Thor, whose hammer beats down the
frost giants of the North. "The gifts bestowed upon Jack are found in
Tartar stories, Hindoo tales, in German legends, and in the fables of
Scandinavia."</p>

<p>Still another is that of <i>Little Red Riding-Hood</i>. The story of Little
Red Riding Hood, as we call her, or Little Red-Cap, as she is called in
the German tales, also comes from the same source, and (as we have seen
in <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">Chapter IX.</a>), refers to the <i>Sun</i> and <i>Night</i>.</p>

<p>"One of the fancies in the most ancient Aryan or Hindoo stories was that
there was a great dragon that was trying to devour the Sun, to prevent
him from shining upon the earth, and filling it with brightness and life
and beauty, and that Indra, the Sun-god, killed the dragon. Now, this is
the meaning of Little Red Riding-Hood, as it is told in our nursery
tales. Little Red Riding-Hood is the Evening <i>Sun</i>, which is always
described as red or golden; the old grandmother is the <i>Earth</i>, to whom
the rays of the Sun bring warmth and comfort. The wolf&mdash;which is a
well-known figure for <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>the <i>Clouds</i> and blackness of <i>Night</i> (in
Teutonic mythology)<a name="FNanchor_558:1_2748" id="FNanchor_558:1_2748"></a><a href="#Footnote_558:1_2748" class="fnanchor">[558:1]</a>&mdash;is the dragon in another form. First, he
devours the grandmother; that is, he wraps the earth in thick clouds,
which the Evening Sun is not strong enough to pierce through. Then, with
the darkness of Night, he swallows up the Evening Sun itself, and all is
dark and desolate. Then, as in the German tale, the night-thunder and
the storm winds are represented by the loud snoring of the wolf; and
then the huntsman, the <i>Morning Sun</i>, comes in all his strength and
majesty, and chases away the night clouds and kills the wolf, and
revives old grandmother Earth and Little Red Riding Hood to life again."</p>

<p>Nor is it in these stories alone that we can trace the ancient Hindoo
legends, and the Sun-myth. There is, as Mr. Bunce observes in his "Fairy
Tales, their Origin and Meaning," scarcely a tale of Greek or Roman
mythology, no legend of Teutonic or Celtic or Scandinavian growth, no
great romance of what we call the middle ages, no fairy story taken down
from the lips of ancient folk, and dressed for us in modern shape and
tongue, that we do not find, in some form or another, in these Eastern
poems, <i>which are composed of allegorical tales of gods and heroes</i>.</p>

<p>When, in the Vedic hymns, Kephalos, Prokris, Hermes, Daphne, Zeus,
Ouranos, stand forth as simple names for the Sun, the Dew, the Wind, the
Dawn, the Heaven and the Sky, each recognized as such, yet each endowed
with the most perfect consciousness, we feel that the great riddle of
mythology is solved, and that we no longer lack the key which shall
disclose its most hidden treasures. When we hear the people saying, "Our
friend the Sun is dead. Will he rise? Will the Dawn come back again?" we
see the death of Hercules, and the weary waiting while Leto struggles
with the birth of Phoibos. When on the return of day we hear the cry&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Rise! our life, our spirit has come back, the darkness is
gone, the light draws near!"</p></div>

<p>&mdash;we are carried at once to the Homeric hymn, and we hear the joyous
shout of all the gods when Phoibos springs to life and light on
Delos.<a name="FNanchor_558:2_2749" id="FNanchor_558:2_2749"></a><a href="#Footnote_558:2_2749" class="fnanchor">[558:2]</a></p>

<p>That the peasant folk-lore of modern Europe still displays <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>episodes of
nature-myth, may be seen in the following story of <i>Vassalissa, the
Beautiful</i>.</p>

<p>Vassalissa's stepmother and two sisters, plotting against her life, send
her to get a light at the house of <i>B&agrave;ba Yag&agrave;</i>, the witch, and her
journey contains the following history of the <i>Day</i>, told, as Mr. Tylor
says, in truest mythic fashion:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Vassalissa goes and wanders, wanders in the forest. She goes,
and she shudders. Suddenly before her bounds a rider, he
himself white, and clad in white, and the trappings white.
<i>And Day began to dawn.</i> She goes farther, when a second rider
bounds forth, himself red, clad in red, and on a red horse.
<i>The Sun began to rise.</i> She goes on all day, and towards
evening arrives at the witch's house. Suddenly there comes
again a rider, himself black, clad in all black, and on a
black horse; he bounded to the gates of the <i>B&agrave;ba Yag&agrave;</i>, and
disappeared <i>as if he had sunk through the earth</i>. <i>Night
fell.</i> After this, when Vassalissa asks the witch, 'Who was
the white rider?' she answered, 'That is my clear <i>Day</i>;' 'Who
was the red rider?' 'That is my red <i>Sun</i>;' 'Who was the black
rider?' 'That is my black <i>Night</i>. They are all my trusty
friends.'"<a name="FNanchor_559:1_2750" id="FNanchor_559:1_2750"></a><a href="#Footnote_559:1_2750" class="fnanchor">[559:1]</a></p></div>

<p>We have another illustration of allegorical mythology in the Grecian
story of <ins class="corr" title="original has Hesph&aelig;stos">Heph&aelig;stos</ins> splitting open with his axe the head of Zeus, and
Athene springing from it, full armed; for we perceive behind this savage
imagery Zeus as the bright <i>Sky</i>, his forehead the <i>East</i>, Heph&aelig;stos as
the young, not yet risen <i>Sun</i>, and Athene as the <i>Dawn</i>, the daughter
of the Sky, stepping forth from the fountain-head of light,&mdash;with eyes
like an owl, pure as a virgin; the golden; lighting up the tops of the
mountains, and her own glorious Parthenon in her own favorite town of
Athens; whirling the shafts of light; the genial warmth of the morning;
the foremost champion in the battle between night and day; in full
armor, in her panoply of light, driving away the darkness of night, and
awakening men to a bright life, to bright thoughts, to bright
endeavors.<a name="FNanchor_559:2_2751" id="FNanchor_559:2_2751"></a><a href="#Footnote_559:2_2751" class="fnanchor">[559:2]</a></p>

<p>Another story of the same sort is that of Kronos. Every one is familiar
with the story of Kronos, who devoured his own children. Now, Kronos is
a mere creation from the older and misunderstood epithet Kronides or
Kronion, the ancient of days. When these days or time had come to be
regarded as a person the myth would certainly follow that he devoured
his own children, as Time is the devourer of the Dawns.<a name="FNanchor_559:3_2752" id="FNanchor_559:3_2752"></a><a href="#Footnote_559:3_2752" class="fnanchor">[559:3]</a> Saturn,
who devours his own children, is the same power whom the Greeks called
Kronos (Time), which may truly be said to destroy whatever it has
brought into existence.</p>

<p>The idea of a <i>Heaven</i>, the "Elysian fields," is also born of the sky.</p>

<p>The "<i>Elysian plain</i>" is far away in the <i>West</i>, where the sun <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>goes
down beyond the bonds of the earth, when Eos gladdens the close of day
as she sheds her violet tints over the sky. The "Abodes of the Blessed"
are golden islands sailing in a sea of blue,&mdash;<i>the burnished clouds
floating in the pure ether</i>. Grief and sorrow cannot approach them;
plague and sickness cannot touch them. The blissful company gathered
together in that far <i>Western land</i> inherits a tearless eternity.</p>

<p>Of the other details in the picture the greater number would be
suggested directly by these images drawn from the phenomena of sunset
and twilight. What spot or stain can be seen on the deep blue ocean in
which the "Islands of the Blessed" repose forever? What unseemly forms
can mar the beauty of that golden home, lighted by the radiance of a
<i>Sun</i> which can never set? Who then but the pure in heart, the truthful
and the generous, can be suffered to tread the violet fields? And how
shall they be tested save by judges who can weigh the thoughts and the
interests of the heart? Thus every soul, as it drew near that joyous
land, was brought before the august tribunal of Minos, Rhadamanthys, and
Aiakos; and they whose faith was in truth a quickening power, might draw
from the ordeals those golden lessons which Plato has put into the mouth
of Socrates, and some unknown persons into the mouths of Buddha and
Jesus. The belief of earlier ages pictured to itself the meetings in
that blissful land, the forgiveness of old wrongs, and the
reconciliation of deadly feuds,<a name="FNanchor_560:1_2753" id="FNanchor_560:1_2753"></a><a href="#Footnote_560:1_2753" class="fnanchor">[560:1]</a> just as the belief of the present
day pictures these things to itself.</p>

<p>The story of a <i>War in Heaven</i>, which was known to all nations of
antiquity, is allegorical, and refers to the battle between light and
darkness, sunshine and storm cloud.<a name="FNanchor_560:2_2754" id="FNanchor_560:2_2754"></a><a href="#Footnote_560:2_2754" class="fnanchor">[560:2]</a></p>

<p>As examples of the prevalence of the legend relating to the struggle
between the co-ordinate powers of good and evil, light and darkness, the
Sun and the clouds, we have that of Phoibos and Python, Indra and
Vritra, Sigurd and Fafuir, Achilleus and Paris, Oidipous and the Sphinx,
Ormuzd and Ahriman, and from the character of the struggle between Indra
and Vritra, and again <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>between Ormuzd and Ahriman, we infer that a myth,
purely <i>physical</i>, in the land of the Five Streams, assumed a moral and
spiritual meaning in Persia, and the fight between the co-ordinate
powers of good and evil, <i>gave birth to the dualism which from that time
to the present has exercised so mighty an influence through the East and
West</i>.</p>

<p>The Apocalypse exhibits Satan with the physical attributes of Ahriman;
he is called the "dragon," the "old serpent," who fights against God and
his angels. The <i>Vedic myth</i>, transformed and exaggerated in the Iranian
books, <i>finds its way through this channel</i> into Christianity. The idea
thus introduced was that of the struggle between Satan and Michael,
which ended in the overthrow of the former, and the casting forth of all
his hosts out of heaven, but it coincides too nearly with a myth spread
in countries held by all the Aryan nations to avoid further
modification. Local tradition substituted St. George or St. Theodore for
Jupiter, Apollo, Hercules, or Perseus. It is under this disguise that
the Vedic myth has come down to our own times, and has still its
festivals and its monuments. Art has consecrated it in a thousand ways.
St. Michael, lance in hand, treading on the dragon, is an image as
familiar now as, <i>thirty centuries ago</i>, that of Indra treading under
foot the demon Vritra could possibly have been to the Hindoo.<a name="FNanchor_561:1_2755" id="FNanchor_561:1_2755"></a><a href="#Footnote_561:1_2755" class="fnanchor">[561:1]</a></p>

<p>The very ancient doctrine of a <span class="smcap">Trinity</span>, three gods in one, can be
explained, rationally, by allegory only. We have seen that the Sun, in
early times, was believed to be the <i>Creator</i>, and became the first
object of adoration. After some time it would be observed that this
powerful and beneficent agent, the solar fire, was the most potent
<i>Destroyer</i>, and hence would arise the first idea of a Creator and
Destroyer united in the same person. But much time would not elapse
before it must have been observed, that the destruction caused by this
powerful being was destruction only in appearance, that destruction was
only reproduction in another form&mdash;<i>regeneration</i>; that if he appeared
sometimes to destroy, he constantly repaired the injury which he seemed
to occasion&mdash;and that, without his light and heat, everything would
dwindle away into a cold, inert, unprolific mass. Thus, at once, in the
same being, became concentrated, the creating, the preserving, and the
destroying powers&mdash;the latter of the three being at the same time both
the <i>Destroyer</i> and <i>Regenerator</i>. Hence, by a very natural and obvious
train of reasoning, arose the <i>Creator</i>, the <i>Preserver</i>, and the
<i>Destroyer</i>&mdash;in India <i>Brahm&#257;</i>, <i>Vishnu</i>, and <i>Siva</i>; in Persia
<i>Oromasdes</i>, <i>Mithra</i>, and <i>Arimanius</i>; in Egypt <i>Osiris</i>, <i>Horus</i>, and
<i>Typhon</i>: in each case <span class="smcap">Three Persons and one God</span>. And thus undoubtedly
arose the <span class="smcap">Trimurti</span>, or the celebrated Trinity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span></p><p>Traces of a similar refinement may be found in the Greek mythology, in
the Orphic <i>Phanes</i>, <i>Ericapeus</i> and <i>Metis</i>, who were all identified
with the <i>Sun</i>, and yet embraced in the first person, <i>Phanes</i>, or
Protogones, the Creator and Generator.<a name="FNanchor_562:1_2756" id="FNanchor_562:1_2756"></a><a href="#Footnote_562:1_2756" class="fnanchor">[562:1]</a> The invocation to the Sun,
in the Mysteries, according to Macrobius, was as follows: "O all-ruling
<i>Sun</i>! <i>Spirit</i> of the world! <i>Power</i> of the world! <i>Light</i> of the
world!"<a name="FNanchor_562:2_2757" id="FNanchor_562:2_2757"></a><a href="#Footnote_562:2_2757" class="fnanchor">[562:2]</a></p>

<p>We have seen in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXXV">Chap. XXXV</a>, that the <i>Peruvian</i> Triad was represented by
three statues, called, respectively, "Apuinti, Churiinti, and
Intihoaoque," which is, "Lord and Father <i>Sun</i>; Son <i>Sun</i>; and Air or
Spirit, Brother <i>Sun</i>."<a name="FNanchor_562:3_2758" id="FNanchor_562:3_2758"></a><a href="#Footnote_562:3_2758" class="fnanchor">[562:3]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Faber, in his "Origin of Pagan Idolatry," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The peculiar mode in which the Hindoos identify their <i>three
great gods</i> with the <i>solar orb</i>, is a curious specimen of the
physical refinements of ancient mythology. At night, in the
west, the Sun is <i>Vishnu</i>; he is <i>Brahm&#257;</i> in the east and
in the morning; and from noon to evening he is <i>Siva</i>."<a name="FNanchor_562:4_2759" id="FNanchor_562:4_2759"></a><a href="#Footnote_562:4_2759" class="fnanchor">[562:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Mr. Moor, in his "Hindu Pantheon," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Most, if not all, of the gods of the Hindoo Pantheon will, on
close investigation, resolve themselves into the <i>three
powers</i> (Brahm&#257;, Vishnu, and Siva), and those powers into
<i>one Deity</i>, Brahm, <i>typified by the Sun</i>."<a name="FNanchor_562:5_2760" id="FNanchor_562:5_2760"></a><a href="#Footnote_562:5_2760" class="fnanchor">[562:5]</a></p></div>

<p>Mr. Squire, in his "Serpent Symbol," observes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is highly probable that the triple divinity of the Hindoos
was originally no more than a personification of the <i>Sun</i>,
whom they called <i>Three-bodied</i>, in the triple capacity of
<i>producing</i> forms by his general <i>heat</i>, <i>preserving</i> them by
his <i>light</i>, or <i>destroying</i> them by the counteracting force
of his <i>igneous</i> matter. <i>Brahm&aacute;</i>, the <i>Creator</i>, was
indicated by the <i>heat of the Sun</i>; <i>Vishnu</i>, the <i>Preserver</i>,
by the <i>light of the Sun</i>, and <i>Siva</i>, the <i>Reproducer</i>, by
the <i>orb of the Sun</i>. In the morning the Sun was <i>Brahm&#257;</i>,
at noon <i>Vishnu</i>, at evening <i>Siva</i>."<a name="FNanchor_562:6_2761" id="FNanchor_562:6_2761"></a><a href="#Footnote_562:6_2761" class="fnanchor">[562:6]</a></p></div>

<p>"He is at once," says Mr. Cox, in speaking of the Sun, "the 'Comforter'
and 'Healer,' the 'Saviour' and 'Destroyer,' who can slay and make alive
at will, and from whose piercing glance no secret can be kept
hid."<a name="FNanchor_562:7_2762" id="FNanchor_562:7_2762"></a><a href="#Footnote_562:7_2762" class="fnanchor">[562:7]</a></p>

<p>Sir William Jones was also of the opinion that the whole Triad of the
Hindoos were identical with the Sun, expressed under the mythical term
O. M.</p>

<p>The idea of a <i>Tri-murti</i>, or triple personification, was developed
gradually, and as it grew, received numerous accretions. It was first
dimly shadowed forth and vaguely expressed in the <i>Rig-Veda</i>, where a
triad of principal gods, <i>Agni</i>, <i>Indra</i>, and <i>Surya</i> is recognized. And
these three gods are <i>One</i>, the <span class="smcap">Sun</span>.<a name="FNanchor_562:8_2763" id="FNanchor_562:8_2763"></a><a href="#Footnote_562:8_2763" class="fnanchor">[562:8]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span></p><p>We see then that the religious myths of antiquity and the fireside
legends of ancient and modern times, have a common root in the mental
habits of primeval humanity, and that they are the earliest recorded
utterances of men concerning the visible phenomena of the world into
which they were born. At first, thoroughly understood, the <i>meaning</i> in
time became unknown. How stories originally told of the Sun, the Moon,
the Stars, &amp;c., became believed in as facts, is plainly illustrated in
the following story told by Mrs. Jameson in her "History of Our Lord in
Art:" "I once tried to explain," says she, "to a good old woman, the
meaning of the word <i>parable</i>, and that the story of the <i>Prodigal Son</i>
was not a fact; she was scandalized&mdash;she was quite sure that Jesus would
never have told anything to his disciples that was not true. Thus she
settled the matter in her own mind, and I thought it best to leave it
there undisturbed."</p>

<p>Prof. Max M&uuml;ller, in speaking of "the comparison of the different forms
of Aryan religion and mythology in India, Persia, Greece, Italy and
Germany," clearly illustrates how such legends are transformed from
intelligible into unintelligible myths. He says:</p>

<p>"In each of these nations there was a tendency to change the original
conception of divine powers, to misunderstand the many names given to
these powers, and to misinterpret the praises addressed to them. In this
manner some of the divine names were changed into half-divine,
half-human heroes, and at last the myths which were true and
intelligible as told originally of the <i>Sun</i>, or the <i>Dawn</i>, or the
<i>Storms</i>, were turned into legends or fables too marvelous to be
believed of common mortals. This process can be watched in India, in
Greece, and in Germany. The same story, or nearly the same, is told of
gods, of heroes, and of men. The divine myth became an heroic legend,
and the heroic legend fades away into a nursery tale. Our nursery tales
have well been called the modern <i>patois</i> of the ancient mythology of
the Aryan race."<a name="FNanchor_563:1_2764" id="FNanchor_563:1_2764"></a><a href="#Footnote_563:1_2764" class="fnanchor">[563:1]</a></p>

<p>In the words of this learned author, "we never lose, we always gain,
when we discover the most ancient intention of sacred traditions,
instead of being satisfied with their later aspect, and their modern
misinterpretations."</p>

if <i>she</i> feared that some one was pursuing her for her destruction."
"And well she may," replied <i>Har</i>, "for he that seeks her is not far
behind, and she has no way to escape but to run before him." "And who is
he," asked <i>Gaugler</i>, "that causes her this anxiety?" "It is the <i>Wolf</i>

fears, for he shall one day overtake and devour her." (Scandinavian
<i>Prose Edda</i>. See Mallet's Northern Antiquities, p. 407). This Wolf is,
as we have said, a personification of <i>Night</i> and <i>Clouds</i>, we therefore
have the almost universal practice among savage nations of making noises
at the time of eclipses, to frighten away the monsters who would
otherwise devour the Sun.</p></div>

<p>Out of this number it has been claimed that one (Josephus) spoke of
Jesus, and another (Tacitus) of the Christians. Of the former it is
almost needless to speak, as that has been given up by Christian divines
many years ago. However, for the sake of those who still cling to it we
shall state the following:</p>

<p>Dr. Lardner, who wrote about <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 1760, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. It was never quoted by any of our Christian ancestors
before <i><ins class="corr" title="original has Esuebius">Eusebius</ins></i>.</p>

<p>2. Josephus has nowhere else mentioned the name or word
<i>Christ</i>, in any of his works, except the testimony above
mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_564:3_2767" id="FNanchor_564:3_2767"></a><a href="#Footnote_564:3_2767" class="fnanchor">[564:3]</a> and the passage concerning James, the Lord's
brother.<a name="FNanchor_564:4_2768" id="FNanchor_564:4_2768"></a><a href="#Footnote_564:4_2768" class="fnanchor">[564:4]</a></p>

<p>3. It interrupts the narrative.</p>

<p>4. The language is quite Christian.</p>

<p>5. It is <i>not</i> quoted by Chrysostom,<a name="FNanchor_564:5_2769" id="FNanchor_564:5_2769"></a><a href="#Footnote_564:5_2769" class="fnanchor">[564:5]</a> though he often
refers to Josephus, and could not have omitted quoting it, had
it been <i>then</i>, in the text.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span></p>

<p>6. It is <i>not</i> quoted by Photius, though he has three articles
concerning Josephus.</p>

<p>7. Under the article <i>Justus of Tiberius</i>, this author
(Photius) expressly states that this historian (Josephus),
being a Jew, <i>has not taken the least notice of Christ</i>.</p>

<p>8. Neither Justin, in his dialogue with Typho the Jew, nor
Clemens Alexandrinus, who made so many extracts from ancient
authors, nor Origen against Celsus, <i>have even mentioned this
testimony</i>.</p>

<p>9. But, on the contrary, Origen openly affirms (ch. xxxv., bk.
i., against Celsus), that Josephus, who had mentioned John the
Baptist, <i>did not acknowledge Christ</i>.<a name="FNanchor_565:1_2770" id="FNanchor_565:1_2770"></a><a href="#Footnote_565:1_2770" class="fnanchor">[565:1]</a></p></div>

<p>In the "Bible for Learners," we read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Flavius Josephus, the well-known historian of the Jewish
people, was born in <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 37, only two years after the death
of Jesus; but though his work is of inestimable value as our
chief authority for the circumstances of the times in which
Jesus and his Apostles came forward, yet he does not seem to
have ever mentioned Jesus himself. At any rate, the passage in
his '<i>Jewish Antiquities</i>' that refers to him is certainly
spurious, and was inserted by a later and a <i>Christian hand</i>.
The <i>Talmud</i> compresses the history of Jesus into a single
sentence, and later Jewish writers concoct mere slanderous
anecdotes. The ecclesiastical fathers mention a few sayings or
events, the knowledge of which they drew from oral tradition
or from writings that have since been lost. The Latin and
Greek historians just mention his name. This meager harvest is
all we reap from sources outside the Gospels."<a name="FNanchor_565:2_2771" id="FNanchor_565:2_2771"></a><a href="#Footnote_565:2_2771" class="fnanchor">[565:2]</a></p></div>

<p>Canon Farrar, who finds himself <i>compelled</i> to admit that this passage
in Josephus is an interpolation, consoles himself by saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The single passage in which he (Josephus) alludes to Him
(Christ) is interpolated, if not wholly spurious, and no one
can doubt that his silence on the subject of Christianity was
as deliberate as it was dishonest."<a name="FNanchor_565:3_2772" id="FNanchor_565:3_2772"></a><a href="#Footnote_565:3_2772" class="fnanchor">[565:3]</a></p></div>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Giles, after commenting on this subject, concludes by
saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Eusebius</i> is the first who quotes the passage, and our
reliance on the judgment, <i>or even the honesty</i>, of this
writer <i>is not so great as to allow of our considering
everything found in his works as undoubtedly genuine</i>."<a name="FNanchor_565:4_2773" id="FNanchor_565:4_2773"></a><a href="#Footnote_565:4_2773" class="fnanchor">[565:4]</a></p></div>

<p>Eusebius, then, is the first person who refers to these passages.<a name="FNanchor_565:5_2774" id="FNanchor_565:5_2774"></a><a href="#Footnote_565:5_2774" class="fnanchor">[565:5]</a>
Eusebius, "<i>whose honesty is not so great as to allow of our considering
everything found in his works as undoubtedly genuine</i>." Eusebius, who
says that <i>it is lawful to lie and cheat for the cause of
Christ</i>.<a name="FNanchor_565:6_2775" id="FNanchor_565:6_2775"></a><a href="#Footnote_565:6_2775" class="fnanchor">[565:6]</a> This Eusebius is the sheet-anchor of reliance for most
we know of the first three centuries of the Christian history. What then
must we think of the <i>history</i> of the first three centuries of the
Christian era?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span></p><p>The celebrated passage in Tacitus which Christian divines&mdash;and even
some liberal writers&mdash;attempt to support, is to be found in his
<i>Annals</i>. In this work he is made to speak of <i>Christians</i>, who "had
their denomination from <i>Christus</i>, who, in the reign of Tiberius, was
put to death as a criminal by the procurator Pontius Pilate."</p>

<p>In answer to this we have the following:</p>

<p>1. This passage, which would have served the purpose of Christian
quotation better than any other in all the writings of Tacitus, or of
any Pagan writer whatever, <i>is not quoted by any of the Christian
Fathers</i>.</p>

<p>2. It is not quoted by Tertullian, though he had read and largely quotes
the works of Tacitus.</p>

<p>3. And though his argument immediately called for the use of this
quotation with so loud a voice (Apol. ch. v.), that his omission of it,
if it had really existed, amounts to a <i>violent improbability</i>.</p>

<p>4. This Father has spoken of Tacitus in a way that it is absolutely
impossible that he should have spoken of him, had his writings contained
such a passage.</p>

<p>5. It is not quoted by Clemens Alexandrinus, <i>who set himself entirely
to the work of adducing and bringing together all the admissions and
recognitions which Pagan authors had made of the existence of Christ
Jesus or Christians before his time</i>.</p>

<p>6. It has been nowhere stumbled upon by the laborious and all-seeking
Eusebius, who could by no possibility have overlooked it, and whom it
would have saved from the labor of forging the passage in Josephus; of
adducing the correspondence of Christ Jesus and Abgarus, and the
Sibylline verses; of forging a divine revelation from the god Apollo, in
attestation of Christ Jesus' ascension into heaven; and innumerable
other of his pious and holy cheats.</p>

<p>7. Tacitus has in no other part of his writings made the least allusion
to "<i>Christ</i>" or "<i>Christians</i>."</p>

<p>8. The use of this passage as part of the evidences of the Christian
religion, is absolutely modern.</p>

<p>9. There is no vestige nor trace of its existence anywhere in the world
before the 15th century.<a name="FNanchor_566:1_2776" id="FNanchor_566:1_2776"></a><a href="#Footnote_566:1_2776" class="fnanchor">[566:1]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span></p><p>10. No reference whatever is made to this passage by any writer or
historian, monkish or otherwise, before that time,<a name="FNanchor_567:1_2777" id="FNanchor_567:1_2777"></a><a href="#Footnote_567:1_2777" class="fnanchor">[567:1]</a> which, to say
the least, is very singular, considering that after that time it is
quoted, or referred to, in an endless list of works, which by itself is
all but conclusive that it was not in existence till the fifteenth
century, which was an age of imposture and of credulity so immoderate
that people were easily imposed upon, believing, as they did, without
sufficient evidence, whatever was foisted upon them.</p>

<p>11. The interpolator of the passage makes Tacitus speak of "<i>Christ</i>,"
not of Jesus <i>the</i> Christ, showing that&mdash;like the passage in
Josephus&mdash;it is, comparatively, a modern interpolation, for</p>

<p>12. The word "<i>Christ</i>" is <i>not a name</i>, but a <span class="allcapsc">TITLE</span>;<a name="FNanchor_567:2_2778" id="FNanchor_567:2_2778"></a><a href="#Footnote_567:2_2778" class="fnanchor">[567:2]</a> it being
simply the Greek for the Hebrew word "<i>Messiah</i>." Therefore,</p>

<p>13. When Tacitus is made to speak of Jesus as "Christ," it is equivalent
to my speaking of Tacitus as "Historian," of George Washington as
"General," or of any individual as "Mister," without adding a <i>name</i> by
which either could be distinguished. And therefore,</p>

<p>14. It has no sense or meaning as he is said to have used it.</p>

<p>15. Tacitus is also made to say that the <i>Christians</i> had their
denomination from <i>Christ</i>, which would apply to any other of the
so-called <i>Christs</i> who were put to death in Judea, as well as to Christ
Jesus. And</p>

<p>16. "The disciples were <i>called</i> Christians first at Antioch" (Acts xi.
26), not because they were followers of a certain Jesus who claimed to
be the Christ, but because "Christian" or "Chr&#275;stian," was a name
applied, at that time, to any good man.<a name="FNanchor_567:3_2779" id="FNanchor_567:3_2779"></a><a href="#Footnote_567:3_2779" class="fnanchor">[567:3]</a> And,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span></p><p>17. The worshipers of the Sun-god, <i>Serapis</i>, were also called
"Christians," and his disciples "Bishops of Christ."<a name="FNanchor_568:1_2780" id="FNanchor_568:1_2780"></a><a href="#Footnote_568:1_2780" class="fnanchor">[568:1]</a></p>

<p>So much, then, for the celebrated passage in Tacitus.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Tacitus says&mdash;according to the passage attributed to him&mdash;that
"those who confessed [to be Christians] were first seized, and then on
their evidence <i>a huge multitude</i> (<i>Ingens Multitudo</i>) were convicted,
not so much on the charge of incendiarism as for <i>their hatred to
mankind</i>." Although M. Renan may say (<i>Hibbert Lectures</i>, p. 70) that
the authenticity of this passage "cannot be disputed," yet the absurdity
of "a huge multitude" of Christians being in Rome, in the days of Nero,
A. D. 64&mdash;about thirty years' after the time assigned for the
crucifixion of Jesus&mdash;has not escaped the eye of thoughtful scholars.
Gibbon&mdash;who saw how ridiculous the statement is&mdash;attempts to reconcile
it with common sense by supposing that Tacitus knew so little about the
Christians that he confounded them with the Jews, and that the hatred
universally felt for the latter fell upon the former. In this way he
believes Tacitus gets his "huge multitude," as the Jews established
themselves in Rome as early as 60 years B. C., where they multiplied
rapidly, living together in the <ins class="corr" title="original Traslevere">Trastevere</ins>&mdash;the most abject portion of
the city, where all kinds of rubbish was put to rot&mdash;where they became
"old clothes" men, the porters and hucksters, bartering tapers for
broken glass, hated by the mass and pitied by the few. Other scholars,
among whom may be mentioned Schwegler (<i>Nachap Zeit.</i>, ii. 229); K&ouml;stlin
(<i>Johann-Lehrbegr.</i>, 472); and Baur (<i>First Three Centuries</i>, i. 133);
also being struck with the absurdity of the statement made by some of
the early Christian writers concerning the wholesale prosecution of
Christians, said to have happened at that time, suppose it must have
taken place during the persecution of Trajan, A. D. 101. It is strange
we hear of no Jewish martyrdoms or Jewish persecutions till we come to
the times of the Jewish war, and then chiefly in Palestine! But fables
must be made realities, so we have the ridiculous story of a "huge
multitude" of Christians being put to death in Rome, in A. D. 64,
evidently for the purpose of bringing Peter there, making him the first
Pope, and having him crucified head downwards. This absurd story is made
more evident when we find that it was not until about A. D. 50&mdash;only 14
years before the alleged persecution&mdash;that the first Christians&mdash;a mere
handful&mdash;entered the capitol of the Empire. (See Renan's <i>Hibbert
Lectures</i>, p. 55.) They were a poor dirty set, without manners, clad in
filthy gaberdines, and smelling strong of garlic. From these, then, with
others who came from Syria, we get our "huge multitude" in the space of
14 years. The statement attributed to Tacitus is, however, outdone by
Orosius, who asserts that the persecution extended "through all the
provinces." (Orosius, ii. 11.) That it was a very easy matter for some
Christian writer to interpolate or alter a passage in the <i>Annals</i> of
Tacitus may be seen from the fact that the <span class="allcapsc">MS.</span> was not known to the
world before the 15th century, and from information which is to be
derived from reading Daill&eacute; <i>On the Right Use of the Fathers</i>, who shows
that they were accustomed to doing such business, and that these
writings are, to a large extent, unreliable.</p>

at finding nothing in the works of Philo about the Christians, their
doctrines, or their sacred books. About the <i>books</i> indeed we need not
expect any notice of these works, but about the Christians and their
doctrines his silence is more remarkable, seeing that he was about sixty
years old at the time of the crucifixion, and living mostly in
Alexandria, so closely connected with Judea, and the Jews, could hardly
have failed to know something of the <i>wonderful events</i> that had taken
place in the city of Jerusalem." (Hebrew and Christian Records, vol. ii.
p. 61.)</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. assumes that these "wonderful events" really took place,
but, if they did not take place, of course Philo's silence on the

were "discovered" in the fifteenth century. Their existence cannot be
traced back further than that time. And as it was an age of imposture,
some persons are disposed to believe that not only portions of the
<i>Annals</i>, but the whole work, was forged at that time. Mr. J. W. Ross,
in an elaborate work published in London some years ago, contended that
the <i>Annals</i> were forged by Poggio Bracciolini, their professed
discoverer. At the time of Bracciolini the temptation was great to palm
off literary forgeries, especially of the chief writers of antiquity, on
<ins class="corr" title="original has acount">account</ins> of the Popes, in their efforts to revive learning, giving money
rewards and indulgences to those who should procure MS. copies of any of
the ancient Greek or Roman authors. Manuscripts turned up as if by
magic, in every direction; from libraries of monasteries, obscure as
well as famous; the most out-of-the-way places,&mdash;the bottom of exhausted
wells, besmeared by snails, as the History of Velleius Paterculus, or
from garrets, where they had been contending with cobwebs and dust, as
the poems of Catullus.</p></div>

in which the Christians were put to death&mdash;is found in the <i>Historia
Sacra</i> of Sulpicius Severus, a Christian Father, who died <span class="allcapsc">A. D.</span> 420; but
it is evident that this writer did not take it from the <i>Annals</i>. On the
contrary, the passage was taken&mdash;as Mr. Ross shows&mdash;from the <i>Historia
Sacra</i>, and bears traces of having been so appropriated. (See Tacitus &amp;
Bracciolini, the Annals forged in the XVth century, by J. W. Ross.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_567:2_2778" id="Footnote_567:2_2778"></a><a href="#FNanchor_567:2_2778"><span class="label">[567:2]</span></a> "<i>Christ</i> is a name having no spiritual signification,
<i>and importing nothing more than an ordinary surname</i>." (Dr. Giles:
Hebrew and Christian Records, vol. ii. p. 64.)</p>

<p>"The name of <i>Jesus</i> and <i>Christ</i> was both known and honored among the
ancients." (Eusebius: Eccl. Hist., lib. 1, ch. iv.)</p>

<p>"The name <i>Jesus</i> is of Hebrew origin, and signifies <i>Deliverer</i>, and
<i>Savior</i>. It is the same as that translated in the Old Testament
<i>Joshua</i>. The word <i>Christ</i>, of Greek origin, is properly <i>not a name</i>
but <i>a title</i>, signifying <i>The Anointed</i>. The whole name is therefore,
<i>Jesus the Anointed</i> or <i>Jesus the Messiah</i>." (Abbott and Conant; Dic.
of Relig. Knowledge, art. "<i>Jesus Christ</i>.")</p>

<p>In the oldest Gospel extant, that attributed to Matthew, we read that
Jesus said unto his disciples, "Whom say ye that I am?" whereupon Simon
Peter answers and says: "Thou art <span class="smcap">the Christ</span>, the Son of the living
God.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that
he was Jesus <span class="allcapsc">THE</span> Christ." (Matt. xvi. 15-20.)</p>

<p>This clearly shows that "<i>the Christ</i>" was simply a <i>title</i> applied to
the man Jesus, therefore, if a <i>title</i>, it cannot be a <i>name</i>. All
passages in the New Testament which speak of <i>Christ</i> as a <i>name</i>,
betray their modern date.</p></div>

New Testament, and is never used by Christians of themselves, only as
spoken by or coming from those without the Church. The general names by
which the early Christians called themselves were 'brethren,'
'disciples,' 'believers,' and 'saints.' The presumption is that the name
<i>Christian</i> was originated by the <i>Heathen</i>." (Abbott and Conant: Dic.
of Relig. Knowledge, art. "Christian.")</p>

<p>"We are called Christians (<i>not</i>, we call ourselves Christians). So,
then, <i>we are the best of men</i> (Chr&#275;stians), and it can never be just
to hate what is (Chr&#275;st) <i>good and kind</i>;" [or, "therefore to hate
what is <i>Chrestian</i> is unjust."] (Justin Martyr: <i>Apol.</i> 1. c. iv.)</p>

<p>"Some of the ancient writers of the Church have not scrupled expressly
to call the Athenian <i>Socrates</i>, and some others of the <i>best</i> of the
heathen moralists, by the name of <i>Christians</i>." (Clark: Evidences of
Revealed Relig., p. 284. Quoted in Ibid. p. 41.)</p>

<p>"Those who lived according to the Logos, (<i>i. e.</i>, the <i>Platonists</i>),
were really <i>Christians</i>." (Clemens Alexandrinus, in <i>Ibid.</i>)</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly we are called <i>Christians</i>, for this reason, <i>and none
other</i>, than because <i>we are anointed with the oil of God</i>." (Theophilus
of Antioch, in Ibid. p. 399.)</p>

<p>"Christ is the Sovereign Reason of whom the whole human race
participates. <i>All those who have lived comformably to a right reason,
have been Christians</i>, notwithstanding that they have always been looked
upon as Atheists." (Justin Martyr: <i>Apol.</i> 1. c. xlvi.)</p>

<p>Lucian makes a person called Triephon answer the question, whether the
affairs of the <i>Christians</i> were recorded in heaven. "All nations are
there recorded, since Chr&#275;stus exists even among the Gentiles."</p></div>
